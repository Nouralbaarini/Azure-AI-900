Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated. The urgency to provide and develop NIBS as an intervention for diverse neurological and mental health indications, and as a catalyst of fundamental brain research, is not dampened by the parallel efforts to address the most life-threatening aspects of COVID-19; rather in many cases the need for NIBS is heightened including the potential to mitigate mental health consequences related to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders. We focus on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) - including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS). METHODS: The present consensus paper provides guidelines and good practices for managing and reopening NIBS clinics and laboratories through the immediate and ongoing stages of COVID-19. The document reflects the analysis of experts with domain relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research \u2013 with an international perspective. We outline regulatory aspects, human resources, NIBS optimization, as well as accommodations for specific demographics. RESULTS: A model based on three phases (early COVID-19 impact, current practices, and future preparation) with an 11-step checklist (spanning removing or streamlining in-person protocols, incorporating telemedicine, and addressing COVID-19-associated adverse events) is proposed. Recommendations on implementing social distancing and sterilization of NIBS related equipment, specific considerations of COVID-19 positive populations including mental health comorbidities, as well as considerations regarding regulatory and human resource in the era of COVID-19 are outlined. We discuss COVID-19 considerations specifically for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly. Numerous case-examples across the world are described. CONCLUSION: There is an evident, and in cases urgent, need to maintain NIBS operations through the COVID-19 pandemic, including anticipating future pandemic waves and addressing effects of COVID-19 on brain and mind. The proposed robust and structured strategy aims to address the current and anticipated future challenges while maintaining scientific rigor and managing risk.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bikson, Marom; Hanlon, Colleen A.; Woods, Adam J.; Gillick, Bernadette T.; Charvet, Leigh; Lamm, Claus; Madeo, Graziella; Holczer, Adrienn; Almeida, Jorge; Antal, Andrea; Ay, Mohammad Reza; Baeken, Chris; Blumberger, Daniel M.; Campanella, Salvatore; Camprodon, Joan; Christiansen, Lasse; Colleen, Loo; Crinion, Jenny; Fitzgerald, Paul; Gallimberti, Luigi; Ghobadi-Azbari, Peyman; Ghodratitoostani, Iman; Grabner, Roland; Hartwigsen, Gesa; Hirata, Akimasa; Kirton, Adam; Knotkova, Helena; Krupitsky, Evgeny; Marangolo, Paola; Nakamura-Palacios, Ester M.; Potok, Weronika; Praharaj, Samir K.; Ruff, Christian C.; Schlaug, Gottfried; Siebner, Hartwig R.; Stagg, Charlotte J.; Thielscher, Axel; Wenderoth, Nicole; Yuan, Ti-Fei; Zhang, Xiaochu; Ekhtiari, Hamed","journal":"Brain Stimul","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffe9ca8d06f53d3b2c6ab8cc9bb56f8ec7e47506.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217075.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2020.05.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1935861X20301091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32413554/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X20301091?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIBS","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Electrical Stimulation"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current COVID","effects of COVID","early COVID","era of COVID","specific considerations of COVID","NIBS clinical services","NIBS technology","NIBS optimization","clinical research","life-threatening aspects of COVID","importance of NIBS operations","ongoing stages of COVID","reopening NIBS clinics","research operations","transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation","transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","current practices","sterilization of NIBS related equipment","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","non-invasive brain stimulation","research work","anticipating future pandemic waves","safety considerations","catalyst of fundamental brain research","future preparation","regulatory aspects","regulatory restrictions","low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation","mental health indications","mental health comorbidities","mental health consequences","anticipated future challenges","possible future outbreaks","spanning","good practices","positive populations","human resources","specific demographics","cases urgent","tES","tDCS","domain relevant expertise","TMS","laboratories","impact","present consensus paper","analysis of experts","social distancing","biomedical treatment","stroke","guidelines","scientific rigor","intervention","re-establishment of access","rapid onset of societal disruption","addiction","phases","structured strategy","accommodations","systematic planning","potential","tACS","world","Numerous case-examples","model","METHODS","Recommendations","needs","telemedicine","international perspective","person protocols","parallel efforts","step checklist","elderly","risk","document","framework","adverse events","mind","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","stakeholders","OBJECTIVE","urgency"],"language":"en"},

To evaluate the effect of extracts of Ah, Ns and Cs on the replication of coronavirus (CoV) and on the expression of TRP genes during coronavirus infection, HeLa-CEACAM1a (HeLa-epithelial carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a) cells were inoculated with MHV-A59 (mouse hepatitis virus\u2013A59) at moi of 30. 1/50 dilution of the extracts was found to be the safe active dose. ELISA kits were used to detect the human IL-8 levels. Total RNA was isolated from the infected cells and cDNA was synthesized. Fluidigm Dynamic Array nanofluidic chip 96.96 was used to analyze the mRNA expression of 21 TRP genes and two control genes. Data was analyzed using the BioMark digital array software. Determinations of relative gene expression values were carried out by using the 2(\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct) method (normalized threshold cycle (Ct) value of sample minus normalized Ct value of control). TCID(50)/ml (tissue culture infectious dose that will produce cytopathic effect in 50 % of the inoculated tissue culture cells) was found for treatments to determine the viral loads. The inflammatory cytokine IL-8 level was found to increase for both 24 and 48 h time points following Ns extract treatment. TRPA1, TRPC4, TRPM6, TRPM7, TRPM8 and TRPV4 were the genes which expression levels changed significantly after Ah, Ns or Cs extract treatments. The virus load decreased when any of the Ah, Ns or Cs extracts was added to the CoV infected cells with Ah extract treatment leading to undetectable virus load for both 6 and 8hpi. Although all the extract treatments had an effect on IL-8 secretion, TRP gene expression and virus load after CoV infection, it was the Ah extract treatment that showed the biggest difference in virus load. Therefore Ah extract is the best candidate in our hands that contains potential treatment molecule(s).

However, it is currently unknown that its HFABP is also closely related to the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 46 patients who met our inclusion criteria within 4 weeks. They were tested for HFABP after the diagnosis of COVID-19, and monitored for HFABP during their hospital stay. We tracked the patients during their hospital stay to determine if they had severe COVID-19 or mild-to-severe transition features. We calculated the chi-square test values found for HFABP to predict the correlation between HFABP levels and the severity of the COVID-19. RESULTS: Of these 46 cases, 16 cases with confirmed COVID-19 were tested for HFABP\u003E 7 ng / mL upon admission; among them, 14 cases were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 within the hospitalization. The Odds ratio of the measured HFABP elevation was 6.81(95% confidence interval [CI] 5.23\u20138.40), and 3 patients with severe COVID-19 progressed in 5 patients with mild HFABP\u003E 7 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the elevation of HFABP is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 in the patients, and the elevated HFABP may cause rapid development of patients with mild COVID-19 into severe COVID-19.

Health communicators need more information on misinformation and the social media environment during a fear-inducing disease outbreak to improve communication practices. The purpose of this study was to describe the content of Ebola-related tweets with a specific focus on misinformation, political content, health related content, risk framing, and rumors. METHODS: We examined tweets from a random 1% sample of all tweets published September 30th - October 30th, 2014, filtered for English-language tweets mentioning \u201CEbola\u201D in the content or hashtag, that had at least 1 retweet (N = 72,775 tweets). A randomly selected subset of 3639 (5%) tweets were evaluated for inclusion. We analyzed the 3113 tweets that meet inclusion criteria using public health trained human coders to assess tweet characteristics (joke, opinion, discord), veracity (true, false, partially false), political context, risk frame, health context, Ebola specific messages, and rumors. We assessed the proportion of tweets with specific content using descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests. RESULTS: Of non-joke tweets, 10% of Ebola-related tweets contained false or partially false information. Twenty-five percent were related to politics, 28% contained content that provoked reader response or promoted discord, 42% contained risk elevating messages and 72% were related to health. The most frequent rumor mentioned focused on government conspiracy. When comparing tweets with true information to tweets with misinformation, a greater percentage of tweets with misinformation were political in nature (36% vs 15%) and contained discord-inducing statements (45% vs 10%). Discord-inducing statements and political messages were both significantly more common in tweets containing misinformation compared with those without(p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the importance of anticipating politicization of disease outbreaks, and the need for policy makers and social media companies to build partnerships and develop response frameworks in advance of an event. While each public health event is different, our findings provide insight into the possible social media environment during a future epidemic and could help optimize potential public health communication strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sell, Tara Kirk; Hosangadi, Divya; Trotochaud, Marc","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2df50cfa6585309dcf10add88d8485ee7b0d55bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375715/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-08697-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Ebola-related tweets","proportion of tweets","health related content","non-joke tweets","content of Ebola","greater percentage of tweets","English-language tweets","misinformation","political content","specific content","health context","public health event","Health communicators","discord","Ebola specific messages","political messages","false information","social media users","social media companies","potential public health communication strategies","possible social media environment","political context","Ebola communication crisis","true information","Western news media","risk elevating messages","specific focus","risk frame","risk framing","communication practices","RESULTS","need","rumors","statements","vs","response frameworks","inclusion criteria","reader response","generated widespread fear","importance of anticipating politicization of disease outbreaks","attention","human coders","descriptive statistics","tweet characteristics","members","partnerships","insight","findings","future epidemic","policy makers","opinion","chi-squared tests","United States","advance","veracity","nature","frequent rumor","government conspiracy","retweet","BACKGROUND","hashtag","sample","CONCLUSIONS","study","politics","selected subset","purpose","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

In a significant number, isolated care proves unnecessary. We investigated the potential impact of molecular point\u2010of\u2010care (POC) diagnostics on patient management and in\u2010hospital costs. METHOD: Prospective collection of data on resource utilization within the hospital from consecutive patients 18 years or older presenting at our university medical center with symptoms of respiratory tract infection from December 2016 to April 2017. A cost analysis was conducted using Markov modeling comparing the actual course of events (on the basis of routine diagnostic tests) with two hypothetical scenarios: when POC would impact time to diagnosis only (scenario 1) or on discharge from the hospital, too (scenario 2). RESULTS: A total of 283 patients were included, of whom 217 (76.7%) were admitted. Influenza and RSV were detected in 31% and 7% of the patients, respectively. Fifty\u2010four percent of patients tested negative, of which 79% were kept in isolated care waiting for test results, with a median duration of 24 hours. Median length of stay was 6.0 days. Mean total in\u2010hospital costs per patient were \u20AC 5243. Introducing POC would lower mean costs per patient to \u20AC 4904 (scenario 1) and \u20AC 4206 (scenario 2). At the hospital level, this would result in a total cost reduction of \u20AC 95 937 to \u20AC 293 471 in a single influenza season. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing POC testing for patients presenting with symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection can reduce time\u2010to\u2010diagnosis, hospital stay and, thereby, in\u2010hospital costs.","publish_time":"2019-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahamat\u2010Langendoen, Janette; Groenewoud, Hans; Kuijpers, Judith; Melchers, Willem J.G.; van der Wilt, Gert Jan","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2a10af0fb0028bc94c66c22059a695c755d8862.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166495.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30950066/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POC","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospital costs","hospital admission","hospital level","consecutive patients","percent of patients","mean costs","symptoms of respiratory tract infection","POC testing","isolated care","Mean total","symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection","time","patient management","RSV","total cost reduction","diagnosis","respiratory syncytial virus","Median length of stay","single influenza season","older presenting","test results","median duration","cost analysis","outcome of diagnostics","potential impact of molecular point","university medical center","resource utilization","years","Markov modeling","Prospective collection of data","basis of routine diagnostic tests","hypothetical scenarios","actual course of events","significant number","METHOD","days","isolation","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","hours","discharge"],"language":"en"},

Direct infestation of lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages by SARS coronavirus (CoV) has been debated as a cause of lymphopenia, but there is no convincing data. Lymphopenia can be caused by glucocorticoids, and thus any debilitating condition has the potential to induce lymphopenia via stress mechanism involving the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis. Cortisol levels are elevated in patients with RSV and Ebola, and cortisol was higher in SARS patients with lymphopenia before any steroid therapy. Glucocorticoids also down-regulate the production of proinflammatory lymphokines. Because of the insidious presentation, SARS was treated with antibacterial, antiviral and supra-physiological doses of glucocorticoids. Treatment with glucocorticoids complicated the issue regarding lymphopenia, and certainly calls into question the status of lymphokines and their prognostic implications in SARS.","publish_time":"2008-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Panesar, N.

The amastigote stage of the parasite infects phagocytes and modulates the effector function of the host cells. Our group has described that the interaction between Leishmania and immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) takes place through dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin that specifically recognizes fungal, viral and bacterial pathogens. The DC-SIGN-mediated recognition of Leishmania amastigotes does not induce DC maturation, and the DC-SIGN ligand/s on Leishmania parasites is/are still unknown. We have also found that the DC-SIGN-related molecule L-SIGN, specifically expressed in lymph node and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, acts as a receptor for L. infantum, the parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis, but does not recognize L. pifanoi, which causes the cutaneous form of the disease. Therefore, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN differ in their ability to interact with Leishmania species responsible for either visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis.

The risk of developing childhood asthma has been linked to the severity and etiology of viral respiratory illnesses in early childhood. Since inner-city infants have unique environmental exposures, we hypothesized that patterns of respiratory viral infections would also be distinct. Methods. We compared the viral etiology of respiratory illnesses in 2 groups: a cohort of 515 infants from 4 inner-city areas and a cohort of 285 infants from mainly suburban Madison, Wisconsin. Nasal secretions were sampled during periods of respiratory illness and at 1 year of age and were analyzed for viral pathogens by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results. Overall, inner-city infants had lower rates of viral detection. Considering specific viruses, sick urban infants had lower rates of detectable rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus infection and higher rates of adenovirus infection. Every urban site had a higher proportion of adenovirus-positive samples associated with illnesses (10%\u201321%), compared with Madison (6%). Conclusions. These findings provide evidence that inner-city babies have different patterns of viral respiratory illnesses than babies who grow up in a more suburban location.

Human mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a C\u2010type serum lectin synthesized by the liver as an acute phase protein and it plays an important role in the innate immune system. Here, we investigate the relationship between the MBL gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of KD in the Japanese population. Method: The frequencies of the genotypes, defined as mutations in codons 52, 54 and 57, and the functional promoter variants of the MBL were determined in 45 patients with KD. Results: The MBL codon\u201054 polymorphism frequency of heterozygote (GGC/GAC) and promoter variants were significantly higher in the KD group than that in the control group (P \u003C 0.05).

The present communication discusses some common pharmacokinetic properties of these two drugs that may be linked to a potential underlying mechanism of action for these antiviral effects. The physicochemical properties of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are consistent with particularly high affinity for the intracellular lysosomal space, which has been implicated as a target site for antiviral activity. The properties of both drugs predict dramatic accumulation in lysosomes, with calculated lysosomal drug concentrations that exceed cytosolic and extracellular concentrations by more than 50 000-fold. These predictions are consistent with previously reported experimentally measured cellular and extracellular concentrations of azithromycin. This is also reflected in the very large volumes of distribution of these drugs, which are among the highest of all drugs currently in use. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin produces very high local concentrations in lysosomes. The clinical significance of this observation is unclear; however, the magnitude of this mechanism of drug accumulation via ion-trapping in lysosomes could be an important factor for the pharmacodynamic effects of this drug combination.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Derendorf, Hartmut","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76bf125fe8e3ac70e62165c2bd829b927e5d1153.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204663.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389720/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920301655; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920301655?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drugs","extracellular concentrations of azithromycin","lysosomes","drug combination","combination of hydroxychloroquine","calculated lysosomal drug concentrations","high local concentrations","mechanism of drug accumulation","antiviral effects","physicochemical properties","common pharmacokinetic properties","high affinity","dramatic accumulation","pharmacodynamic effects","antiviral activity","intracellular lysosomal space","potential underlying mechanism of action","disappearance of viral load","significant reductions","COVID","patients","recent report","present communication","important factor","magnitude","clinical significance","observation","target site","large volumes of distribution","use","predictions","fold"],"language":"en"},

Since its detection in China at the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus has rapidly spread throughout the world and has caused an international public health emergency. The most common manifestation is flu-like symptoms. Mild infections usually improve within a few days, but COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Gastrointestinal symptoms are less common but possible and more difficult to recognize as part of a COVID-19 syndrome. In line with the current opinion of the WHO, we strongly believe that preventive measures and early diagnosis of COVID-19 are crucial to interrupt virus spread and avoid local outbreaks. We report the cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to our Emergency Department who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms at admission. LEARNING POINTS: The novel COVID-19 infection is a severe public health problem which is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide. Although uncommon, there may be a relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19, as reported in recent studies. Early detection and isolation of patients with COVID-19 infection is the only way to control and limit the global spread of this virus.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poggiali, Erika; Ramos, Pau Mateo; Bastoni, Davide; Vercelli, Andrea; Magnacavallo, Andrea","journal":"Eur J Case Rep Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aaf75b2d2b616ea732810c5f84c4b81dbcba764d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162568.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32309266/; https://doi.org/10.12890/2020_001632","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Emergency Department"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["novel COVID","cases of COVID","early diagnosis of COVID","Gastrointestinal symptoms","coronavirus disease","novel coronavirus","Early detection","global spread","severe public health problem","international public health emergency","severe pneumonia","isolation of patients","infectious disease","Emergency Department","common manifestation","acute respiratory distress syndrome","end","preventive measures","relationship","increasing number of deaths","days","world","flu","LEARNING POINTS","line","current opinion","Mild infections","local outbreaks","China","way","nCoV","admission","recent studies"],"language":"en"},

The virus is endemic in the Middle East but can be transmitted to other countries by travel activity. The introduction of MERS-CoV into the Republic of Korea by an infected traveler resulted in a hospital outbreak of MERS that entailed 186 cases and 38 deaths. The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein binds to the cellular protein DPP4 via its receptor binding domain (RBD) and mediates viral entry into target cells. During the MERS outbreak in Korea, emergence and spread of viral variants that harbored mutations in the RBD, D510G and I529T, was observed. Counterintuitively, these mutations were found to reduce DPP4 binding and viral entry into target cells. In this study, we investigated whether they also exerted proviral effects. We confirm that changes D510G and I529T reduce S protein binding to DPP4 but show that this reduction only translates into diminished viral entry when expression of DPP4 on target cells is low. Neither mutation modulated S protein binding to sialic acids, S protein activation by host cell proteases, or inhibition of S protein-driven entry by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins. In contrast, changes D510G and I529T increased resistance of S protein-driven entry to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and sera from MERS patients. These findings indicate that MERS-CoV variants with reduced neutralization sensitivity were transmitted during the Korean outbreak and that the responsible mutations were compatible with robust infection of cells expressing high levels of DPP4. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV has pandemic potential, and it is important to identify mutations in viral proteins that might augment viral spread. In the course of a large hospital outbreak of MERS in the Republic of Korea in 2015, the spread of a viral variant that contained mutations in the viral spike protein was observed. These mutations were found to reduce receptor binding and viral infectivity. However, it remained unclear whether they also exerted proviral effects. We demonstrate that these mutations reduce sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization and are compatible with robust infection of target cells expressing large amounts of the viral receptor DPP4.","publish_time":"2018-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Elzayat, Mahmoud Tarek; Wang, Lingshu; Graham, Barney S.; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Drosten, Christian; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan; Hoffmann, Markus","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0f1ec9f037c5141e44411f686d908fe3a15d223.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6321919.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404801/; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/2/e01381-18.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01381-18","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["viral spike protein","MERS outbreak","viral spread","S protein binding","viral receptor DPP4","viral variants","viral proteins","DPP4 binding","viral infectivity","diminished viral entry","MERS-CoV variants","MERS-CoV spike","S protein activation","cellular protein DPP4","IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV","MERS patients","introduction of MERS","protein binds","inhibition of S protein-driven entry","large hospital outbreak of MERS","responsible mutations","I529T increased resistance of S protein-driven entry","expression of DPP4","robust infection of target cells","robust infection of cells","receptor binding domain","high levels of DPP4","changes D510G","Korean outbreak","Republic of Korea","reduced neutralization sensitivity","RBD","proviral effects","antibody-mediated neutralization","large amounts","transmembrane proteins","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","sialic acids","host cell proteases","monoclonal antibodies","interferon","sera","pandemic potential","infected traveler","emergence","contrast","threat","reduction","course","cases","findings","public health","countries","travel activity","deaths","study"],"language":"en"},

A significant fraction of the cost and morbidity of asthma derives from acute care for asthma exacerbations. In the United States alone, there are approximately 15.0 million outpatient visits, 2 million emergency room visits, and 500,000 hospitalizations each year for management of acute asthma. Common respiratory viruses, especially rhinoviruses, cause the majority of exacerbations in children and adults. Infection of airway epithelial cells with rhinovirus causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. The host response to viral infection is likely to influence susceptibility to asthma exacerbation. Having had at least one exacerbation is an important risk factor for recurrent exacerbations suggesting an \u201Cexacerbation-prone\u201D subset of asthmatics. Factors underlying for the \u201Cexacerbation-prone\u201D phenotype are incompletely understood but include extrinsic factors: cigarette smoking, medication noncompliance, psychosocial factors, and co-morbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, rhinosinusitis, obesity, and intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications; as well as intrinsic factors such as deficient epithelial cell production of the anti-viral type I interferons (IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B2). A better understanding of the biologic mechanisms of host susceptibility to recurrent exacerbations will be important for developing more effective preventions and treatments aimed at reducing the significant cost and morbidity associated with this important global health problem.","publish_time":"2009-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dougherty, RH; Fahy, John V","journal":"Clinical \u0026 Experimental Allergy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c4454c7abbaae7c826f483fdefa56d3119e2463.json; document_parses/pdf_json/08bcfdb6c437369e2d6a4fdbbb1eac16b6a38c3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2730743.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2730743?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2222.2008.03157.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19187331/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["asthma exacerbations","morbidity of asthma","recurrent exacerbations","exacerbation-prone","management of acute asthma","psychosocial factors","intrinsic factors","extrinsic factors","majority of exacerbations","viral infection","significant cost","Infection of airway epithelial cells","important risk factor","recruitment of inflammatory cells","biologic mechanisms of host susceptibility","IFN-\u03B1","IFN-\u03B2","host response","prevalent chronic respiratory disease","acute care","important global health problem","outpatient visits","significant fraction","anti-viral type","gastroesophageal reflux disease","emergency room visits","Common respiratory viruses","deficient epithelial cell production","release of pro-inflammatory cytokines","obesity","medication noncompliance","cigarette smoking","co-morbidities","intolerance","hospitalizations","interferons","non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications","chemokines","rhinosinusitis","neutrophils","rhinoviruses","year","treatments","lymphocytes","better understanding","effective preventions","children","adults","people","subset of asthmatics","phenotype","eosinophils","United States"],"language":"en"},

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) have the unique ability to produce very high levels of type I IFN following viral infection in vivo. Most recent research has focused on oligonucleotide-mediated induction of type I IFN production, implicating viral genome and replication intermediates as the stimulus for this response. However there are additional viral ligands which can potentially induce type I IFN production in pDCs, such as envelope glycoproteins, viral glycolipids, tegument, capsid or nuclear proteins.

Since its early colonial days, Hong Kong has been an open port serving China and the international community. Reexport trade was the traditional advantage until 1949, when China adopted a closed-door policy. Industrialization since the 1950s has brought growth and expansion, taking advantage of the low cost of labor and the British legal system. However, the situation changed after the early 1980s, partly because of low costs in China pulled investment from Hong Kong, and the post-1997 political uncertainty also resulted in short-term investment behavior. Economic overheating in the mid-1990s led to severe recession after the Asian financial crisis. Economic restructuring has been slow since 1997. Economic narrowness with concentration in real estate development and finance, together with an increase in welfare spending, lowered competitiveness.

The main objective of this work is to evaluate the risk of entry of animal infectious zoonotic and non-zoonotic diseases from North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to countries of the European Union. A probabilistic formulation has been developed to obtain the probabilities of introduction of diseases associated with each possible route of entry in the European Union. The results show that, among the infectious diseases analyzed in this study, avian influenza and Newcastle disease are the ones with a higher risk of entry in the European Union and the wild bird\u0027s migration is the route with greater impact. It is confirmed a moderate probability of entry of some vector-borne diseases, bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease, through wind flow from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Due to the absence of live dromedary movement to Europe, the more likely way of entry of the Middle East respiratory syndrome is through the infected people movement from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. This study includes different methodologies. A model of vectors dispersion in wind currents has been established to assess the risk of introduction of vector borne diseases. It is applicable both in animal health and public health.

Some sleep-improving drugs may inhibit the respiratory system and worsen the condition. Prolonged bedside instruction may increase the risk of medical infections. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety and sleep quality of COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 51 patients who entered the isolation ward were included in the study and randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technology for 30 min per day for 5 consecutive days. During this period, the control group received only routine care and treatment. Before and after the intervention, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Sleep State Self-Rating Scale (SRSS) were used to measure and record patient anxiety and sleep quality. Finally, data analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 software. RESULTS: The average anxiety score (STAI) before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.730), and the average anxiety score after intervention was statistically significant (P \u003C 0.001). The average sleep quality score (SRSS) of the two groups before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.838), and it was statistically significant after intervention (P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION: Progressive muscle relaxation as an auxiliary method can reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Kai; Chen, Ying; Wu, Duozhi; Lin, Ruzheng; Wang, Zaisheng; Pan, Liqing","journal":"Complement Ther Clin Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0620e6b5c434e4a85421b31064f5777f43cafaf7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102525.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379667/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1744388120302784; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1744388120302784","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sleep quality of COVID","intervention","average sleep quality score","low sleep quality","average anxiety score","high levels of anxiety","record patient anxiety","Patients","Sleep State Self-Rating Scale","Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale","effect of progressive muscle relaxation","STAI","SRSS","experimental group","isolation treatment","control groups","isolation ward","auxiliary method","randomized controlled clinical trial","total","technology","PMR","routine care","Coronavirus Disease","risk of medical infections","Prolonged bedside instruction","SPSS","respiratory system","METHODS","BACKGROUND","study","drugs","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","data analysis","consecutive days","software","condition","period","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Recently, PEDV had a large negative economic impact on the swine industries in Asia and North America. In 2014, PEDV re\u2010emerged in many European countries, but most countries only reported a few sporadic cases. Here, we report the epidemic wave that occurred in Italy from 2015 to 2017. During this time, PEDV was detected by real\u2010time PCR in 438 farms located mainly in the high\u2010density pig production area in Northern Italy. Most of the outbreaks were in farrow\u2010to\u2010finish, farrow\u2010to\u2010wean and finisher farms. Clinical signs were observed mainly in suckling and fattening animals, while mortality rates were higher in piglets, reaching 50%. A sequence analysis showed that a PEDV strain, similar to the OH851 S\u2010INDEL strain isolated in the USA in January 2014, was responsible for the outbreaks in Italy in 2015 and 2016. However, from January 2017, a recombinant variant strain, containing a portion of the Swine Enteric Coronavirus in the S1 gene, spread and almost completely outcompeted the previous nonrecombinant strain. In total, 14.1% of the environmental swabs collected from trucks at slaughterhouses after animals were unloaded tested positive for PEDV before the trucks were cleaned and disinfected, and 46% remained positive after cleaning and disinfection processes were performed. Moreover, environmental swabs indicated that 17.3% of the empty trucks arriving at the farms to load animals were PEDV\u2010positive.

This should take into consideration existing licensed antiviral drugs against other viral diseases already known to be safe for use in humans. In this report, evidence is presented that HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) currently used in anti-HIV-1 therapies might exert some effects on SARS and perhaps, on avian influenza. Evidence for the potential benefits of PIs against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is provided by empirical clinical studies, in vivo viral inhibition assays and computational simulations of the docking of these compounds to the active site of the main SARS-CoV protease. As suggested by in silico docking of these molecules to a theoretical model of a subunit of type A influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, there also exists a remote possibility that these PIs may have an effect on avian influenza viruses. Although this evidence is still far from being definitive, the results so far obtained suggest that PIs should be seriously taken into consideration for further testing as potential therapeutic agents for SARS and avian influenza.","publish_time":"2005-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savarino, Andrea","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0fc61c82acd36e645f5d34ea011fde41c5a7a544.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108403.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653205000880; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653205000880","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","avian influenza viruses","evidence","main SARS-CoV protease","potential benefits of PIs","viral diseases","influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","unexpected diseases","anti-HIV","silico docking","protease inhibitors","viral inhibition assays","potential therapeutic agents","consideration existing licensed antiviral drugs","subunit of type","public health","severe acute respiratory syndrome","computational simulations","serious threat","empirical clinical studies","active site","testing","immediate response","theoretical model","molecules","compounds","therapies","remote possibility","humans","results","effects","report"],"language":"en"},

Mutations of its genomic RNA frequently occur during viral replication, which is believed to be a force contributing to viral evolution. Nevertheless, accumulating evidences show that some JEV strains may have actually arisen from RNA recombination between genetically different populations of the virus. We have demonstrated that RNA recombination in JEV occurs unequally in different cell types. In the present study, viral RNA fragments transfected into as well as viral RNAs synthesized in mosquito cells were shown not to be stable, especially in the early phase of infection possibly via cleavage by exoribonuclease. Such cleaved small RNA fragments may be further degraded through an RNA interference pathway triggered by viral double-stranded RNA during replication in mosquito cells, resulting in a lower frequency of RNA recombination in mosquito cells compared to that which occurs in mammalian cells. In fact, adjustment of viral RNA to an appropriately lower level in mosquito cells prevents overgrowth of the virus and is beneficial for cells to survive the infection. Our findings may also account for the slower evolution of arboviruses as reported previously.","publish_time":"2014-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiang, Wei-Wei; Chuang, Ching-Kai; Chao, Mei; Chen, Wei-June","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28b9f3f930989b565d59473a64820456c5f9dbab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4140105.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/471323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25165704/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","JEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA fragments","adjustment of viral RNA","genomic RNA","mosquito cells","viral double-stranded RNA","viral replication","viral evolution","lower frequency of RNA recombination","RNA interference pathway","viral RNAs","mammalian cells","cleaved small RNA fragments","JEV strains","Japanese encephalitis virus","lower level","different populations","early phase of infection","different cell types","slower evolution of arboviruses","overgrowth","symptoms","cleavage","present study","central nervous system","accumulating evidences","fact","exoribonuclease","Mutations","force","findings","flaviviruses"],"language":"en"},

To look for potential infectious etiologies, we performed a pilot study using multiple-target real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 27 infectious agents, including nine bacterial organisms and 18 respiratory viruses in middle ear fluids (MEFs) from children with OME. QPCR was also performed for the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes contained in the current vaccine. RESULTS: Forty-eight MEF samples were obtained and qPCR detected bacterial nucleic acid (NA) in 39/48 (81 %) and viral NA in 7/48 (15 %). Alloiococcus otitidis and S. pneumoniae were both detected in 15/48 (31 %) MEFs, followed by M. catarrhalis in 14/48 (29 %), H. influenzae in 5/48 (10 %) and M. pneumoniae in 4/48 (8 %). Rhinoviruses were most common virus type detected, found in 4/48 (8 %) MEFs. Serotypes included in the current 13-serotype vaccine were detected in only 3/15 (20 %) S. pneumoniae qPCR-positive MEFs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria may play an important role in OME, since over 80 % of MEFs contained bacterial NA. Further research into the role of A. otitidis in OME will be helpful. Serotypes of S. pneumoniae not included in the current 13-serotype vaccine may be involved in OME.

In this study, the viral structural protein 7 (VP7) polyclonal antibody was prepared with immunized mouse to explore the presence of small VP7 gene-encoded proteins in Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus. The expression pattern of vp7 gene was investigated by its overexpression in BmN cells. In addition to VP7, supplementary band was identified with western blotting technique. The virion, BmCPV infected cells and midguts were also examined using western blotting technique. 4, 2 and 5 bands were detected in the corresponding samples, respectively. The replication of BmCPV genome in the cultured cells and midgut of silkworm was decreased by reducing the expression level of vp7 gene using RNA interference.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study in 24 PICUs in Bavaria (Germany) from October 2010 to September 2013. Influenza cases among children between 1 month and 16 years of age admitted to these PICUs with acute respiratory infection were confirmed by PCR analysis of respiratory secretions. RESULTS: A total of 24/7/20 influenza-associated PICU admissions were recorded in the post-pandemic seasons 1/2/3; incidence estimates per 100,000 children were 1.72/0.76/1.80, respectively. Of all 51 patients, 80 % had influenza A, including 65 % with A(H1N1)pdm09. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was almost absent in season 2 (incidence 0.11), but dominated PICU admissions in seasons 1 (incidence 1.35) and 3 (incidence 1.17). Clinical data was available for 47 influenza patients; median age was 4.8 years (IQR 1.6\u201311.0).

Thirty-six patients (77 %) had underlying medical conditions. Median duration of PICU stay was 3 days (IQR 1\u201311). Forty-seven per cent of patients received mechanical ventilation, and one patient (2 %) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; 19 % were treated with oseltamivir. Five children (11 %) had pulmonary sequelae. Five children (11 %) died; all had underlying chronic conditions and were infected with A(H1N1)pdm09. In season 3, patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 were younger than in season 1 (p = 0.020), were diagnosed more often with bronchitis/bronchiolitis (p = 0.004), and were admitted to a PICU later after the onset of influenza symptoms (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Active screening showed a continued high incidence of A(H1N1)pdm09-associated PICU admissions in the post-pandemic seasons 1 and 3, and indicated possible underestimation of incidence in previous German studies. The age shift of severe A(H1N1)pdm09 towards younger children may be explained by increasing immunity in the older paediatric population. The high proportion of patients with underlying chronic conditions indicates the importance of consistent implementation of the current influenza vaccination recommendations for risk groups in Germany.","publish_time":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Streng, Andrea; Prifert, Christiane; Weissbrich, Benedikt; Liese, Johannes G.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/405b2a0699c55c52df71d3a52c454486e2f3ad1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4683816.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26678835/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1293-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICU","PCR","ARDS"],"locations":["Bavaria","Germany"],"keyphrases":["influenza patients","H1N1","Influenza cases","influenza-associated PICU admissions","post-pandemic influenza seasons","pandemic influenza subtype","influenza-associated pneumonia","Previous influenza surveillance","clinical characteristics of influenza","pdm09-associated PICU admissions","increased incidence of PICU admissions","onset of influenza symptoms","incidence estimates","PICUs","younger children","current influenza vaccination recommendations","dominated PICU admissions","post-pandemic seasons","continued high incidence","cent of patients","possible underestimation of incidence","Germany","high proportion of patients","underlying chronic conditions","Median duration of PICU stay","median age","years of age","active screening","IQR","medical conditions","bronchiolitis","bronchitis","age shift of severe","Clinical data","prospective surveillance study","previous German studies","acute respiratory infection","older paediatric population","secondary bacterial pneumonia","paediatric intensive care units","PCR analysis of respiratory secretions","importance of consistent implementation","risk groups","month","mechanical ventilation","immunity","days","Bavaria","frequent diagnoses","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","METHODS","total","pulmonary sequelae","RESULTS","ARDS","oseltamivir"],"language":"en"},

Negative staining electron microscopy is one method used to screen environmental and clinical samples for relevant infectious pathogens. Unfortunately, bacterial endospores, like those of Bacillus anthracis, are difficult to identify using this method because of their density that prevents imaging of structural details. Thin section electron microscopy would be an alternative method but this usually requires a few days for preparation and diagnosis. In the present paper we describe the development of a rapid thin section protocol, using mainly Bacillus subtilis spores as a model, which allows an unequivocal diagnosis of endospores within 2 h. The protocol involves chemical fixation assisted by heat or microwaves, rapid dehydration, embedding in the low-viscosity resin LR White and chemically enhanced polymerization. Structural preservation of spores is comparable to preservation after standard Epon embedding. Immunolabeling experiments using B. atrophaeus spores and a specific antibody suggest that the protocol preserves significant antigenicity for on-section immunocytochemistry and therefore offers the possibility for the strain typing of spores using specific antibodies. Further experiments with vegetative bacteria, viruses and cell cultures indicate that the rapid thin section protocol not only preserves spores but also other biological structures. Because of its universality and speed the described protocol complements negative staining electron microscopy as a front line method for the morphology-based diagnosis of pathogens in environmental and clinical samples.","publish_time":"2007-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Laue, Michael; Niederw\u00F6hrmeier, B\u00E4rbel; Bannert, Norbert","journal":"Journal of Microbiological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f42306a841ad7558e5d19de5593885c6444cfb78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114357.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167701207000954; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701207000954","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","LR White"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["section protocol","atrophaeus spores","anthrax spores","section electron microscopy","Structural preservation of spores","described protocol","Bacillus subtilis spores","line method","Negative staining electron microscopy","alternative method","section immunocytochemistry","relevant infectious pathogens","management of infectious pathogens","morphology-based diagnosis of pathogens","clinical samples","rapid dehydration","unequivocal diagnosis of endospores","Abstract Emerging infectious diseases","Bacillus anthracis","specific antibody","specific antibodies","Immunolabeling experiments","bacterial endospores","imaging of structural details","SARS","heat","low-viscosity resin LR White","cell cultures","vegetative bacteria","viruses","microwaves","model","development","enhanced polymerization","bioterror attacks","significant antigenicity","chemical fixation","density","strain","possibility","standard Epon","public health","detection","days","present paper","preparation","universality","biological structures","need"],"language":"en"},

The use of molecular respiratory panel assays has become increasingly common for medical care of patients with ARTIs. Study design This was a 6-year retrospective, single-centered study of pediatric inpatients who tested positive for an ARTI respiratory pathogen. We examined the relationship between clinical outcomes and whether the patient was tested using the Luminex Respiratory Viral Panel ([RVP]; in-use: Dec. 2009 \u2013 Jul. 2012) or Biofire Respiratory Pathogen Panel ([RP]; in-use Aug. 2012 \u2013 Jun. 2016). The prevalence and duration of pre-test empiric antibiotics, post-test oseltamivir administration to influenza patients, chest x-rays and length of stay between the two assays was compared. Results A total of 5142 patients (1264 RVP; 3878 RP) were included. The median laboratory turn-around-time for RP was significantly shorter than RVP (1.4 vs. 27.1 h, respectively; p \u003C .001). Patients tested with RP were less likely to receive empiric antibiotics (OR: 0.45; p \u003C .001; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.52) and had a shorter duration of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (6.4 h vs. 32.9 h; p \u003C .001) compared to RVP patients. RP influenza patients had increased oseltamivir use post- test compared to RVP influenza patients (OR: 13.56; p \u003C .001; 95% CI: 7.29, 25.20). Conclusions Rapid molecular testing positively impacts patient management of ARTIs. Adopting assays with a shorter turn-around-time improves decision making by decreasing empirical antibiotic use and duration, decreasing chest x-rays, increasing timely oseltamivir administration, and reducing length of stay.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Brian R.; Hassan, Ferdaus; Jackson, Mary Anne; Selvarangan, Rangaraj","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b5e58ca9be9b7f5ea6b429face62a42bde5d975.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106386.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321830283X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.11.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502640/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321830283X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARTI","RVP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVP patients","RVP influenza patients","RP influenza patients","use of molecular respiratory panel assays","ARTI respiratory pathogen","medical care of patients","shorter duration of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics","duration of pre-test empiric antibiotics","Biofire Respiratory Pathogen Panel","Luminex Respiratory Viral Panel","empirical antibiotic use","shorter turn","acute respiratory tract infections","post-test oseltamivir administration","timely oseltamivir administration","increased oseltamivir","chest x-rays","length of stay","Abstract Background Empiric antibiotic treatment","patient management of ARTIs","Study design","median laboratory turn","Conclusions Rapid molecular testing","single-centered study of pediatric inpatients","children","post- test","decision","year retrospective","prevalence","clinical outcomes","relationship","total"],"language":"en"},

Features of the disease are suggestive of an underlying immune\u2010mediated process, but the association of this disease with a pathogen is still unknown. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To search for candidate etiologic agent associated with cases if MUO using next generation metagenomic sequencing. ANIMALS: Twenty\u2010two dogs diagnosed with either MUO (11/22; 10 CSF and 3 brain), or noninflammatory CNS diseases inconsistent with MUO (11/22; 11 CSF and 2 brain) that served as negative controls. METHODS: A case control study was performed by identifying MUO and non\u2010MUO cases. Samples were blindly processed and then unblinded for comparative analyses. Inclusion criteria for MUO cases included consistent MRI lesions and inflammatory CSF with a negative PCR panel for infectious agents or histopathologic diagnosis. Dogs with glucocorticoid therapy within 2 weeks of sample collection were excluded. Fresh\u2010frozen cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; 21) and brain (5) samples were collected and RNA and DNA were extracted separately for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Known positive samples were used as controls to validate our sequencing and analysis pipelines and to establish limits of detection. Sequencing results were analyzed at a nucleotide and protein level for broad comparison to known infectious organisms. RESULTS: No candidate etiologic agents were identified in dogs with MUO.

The need for investment in critical social infrastructure\u2014including explicitly articulated plans\u2014became a priority for managing future pandemics. Over the past 15 years, pandemic planning has evolved with the adoption of a whole-of-society approach to disaster risk reduction. There is recognition of the social gradient of risk, which emerges from the interaction between social determinants of health, risk of exposure, and adverse impacts from a pandemic. Additionally, there is better understanding of the benefits of planning according to functional needs, rather than deficit-oriented labelling. In this paper, we reflect on how the framing of vulnerable or high-risk populations has evolved since SARS. Looking to the future, we present the imperative for the creation of institutional space for engagement of high-risk populations in pandemic planning processes, including participatory governance. Innovative consultation strategies are needed to enhance collective asset literacy and ensure planning is adaptive to the changing social fabric. Progressive pandemic planning in the next decade must be inclusive and sensitive to modern definitions of family, varied abilities, cultural practices and gender and sexual diversity, thereby reflecting a whole-of-society approach to disaster risk reduction.","publish_time":"2019-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Sullivan, Tracey L.; Phillips, Karen P.","journal":"Nat Hazards (Dordr)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/524213bac772801cb1878db891587872e9010ee3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088565.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-019-03584-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214659/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social determinants of health","pandemic planning processes","Progressive pandemic planning","health systems","benefits of planning","social gradient of risk","disaster risk reduction","risk of exposure","health care workers","realization of occupational health risks","public health emergency response","critical social infrastructure","changing social fabric","society approach","SARS","engagement of high-risk populations","future pandemics","cultural practices","varied abilities","responders","modern definitions of family","gender","global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","creation of institutional space","decade","Canada","collective asset literacy","articulated plans","functional needs","sexual diversity","priority","imperative","investment","wake","adverse impacts","participatory governance","interaction","deficit-oriented labelling","Innovative consultation strategies","framing of vulnerable","better understanding","recognition","years","adoption","paper"],"language":"en"},

There were four stroke cases with simultaneously diagnosis of Covid-19 till the April 14, 2020 in the city of Sakarya, Turkey. They were aged between 45 to 77 years. All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in Sakarya. The patients had all commonly reported symptoms of Covid-19. Three patients have elevated D-dimer levels, and two of them had high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. They were managed symptomatically for both the infection and the stroke. Our findings suggest that ischemic cerebrovascular diseases may simultaneously develop in the course of Covid-19 independently of the critical disease process. Increased inflammation predicted by CRP and D-dimer levels may play a role in the formation of ischemia.

Exocytosis of large cargo is essential for many physiological processes, including collagen and lipoprotein secretion, and defects in the process lead to disease. In addition, enveloped viruses that bud into the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi complex must also be transported through Golgi cisternae for secretion from the infected cell.

Unfortunately, there is no medication that has been approved by the FDA, gone through controlled studies and demonstrated an effect on the virus for this global pandemic. Although there are cures for illnesses and developments made by leaps and bounds in our day, the strongest and most effective weapon that society has against this virus that is affecting not just health but also economics, politics, and social order, is the prevention of its spread. The main points in preventing the spread in society are hand hygiene, social distancing and quarantine. With increased testing capacity, detecting more COVID-19 positive patients in the community will also enable the reduction of secondary cases with stricter quarantine rules.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00DCNER, Rahmet; HASANO\u011ELU, \u0130mran; AKTA\u015E, Firdevs","journal":"Turk J Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcb18188e1e1434cfbef4763e444551951ed6303.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195988.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293835/; https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2004-146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread","society","social order","COVID","virus","social distancing","global pandemic","stricter quarantine rules","public health emergency of international concern","hand hygiene","reduction of secondary cases","effective weapon","economics","politics","leaps","countries","controlled studies","day","community","positive patients","increased testing capacity","action","infection","gravity","prevention","main points","illnesses","developments","FDA","situation","medication"],"language":"en"},

Determining whether behavior at intake may predict subsequent illness in the animal shelter may influence the management of dogs housed at animal shelters and reduce overall disease. While normally associated with mild disease and low mortality rates, respiratory disease nevertheless poses significant challenges to the management of dogs in the stressful environment of animal shelters due to its highly infectious nature. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore whether behavior at intake can predict subsequent occurrence and progression of upper respiratory disease in dogs at animal shelters. In a correlational study, 84 dogs were assessed throughout their stay at a city animal shelter. The dogs were subjected to a behavioral assessment, 1 min in-kennel behavioral observations across two observation periods, and the collection of urinary cortisol:creatinine (C:C) ratio. The occurrence and progression of upper respiratory disease was monitored through repeated clinical exams (rectal temperature and the occurrence of nasal and ocular discharge, and presence of coughing and sneezing). A basic PLS Path regression model revealed that time in the shelter (estimate = .53, p \u003C .001), and sociability (estimate = .24, p \u003C .001) and curiosity scores (estimate = .09, p = .026) were associated with increased illness. Activity and anxiety scores, however, were not associated with illness. Urinary C:C, taken on the first full day, did not predict subsequent illness when accounting for time. Limitations included attrition of dogs, a small percentage receiving vaccinations, and continuous and non-systematic rotation of dogs in the kennels. Understanding if behavior can predict subsequent illness may improve shelter management practices, and in turn, result in improved live-release outcomes.","publish_time":"2019-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Protopopova, Alexandra; Hall, Nathaniel J.; Brown, Kelsea M.; Andrukonis, Allison S.; Hekman, Jessica P.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbdc601a2f84e6e9749f437d5f25758f145c9137.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6808433.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Urinary"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of dogs","subsequent illness","attrition of dogs","subsequent occurrence","city animal shelter","progression of upper respiratory disease","mild disease","overall disease","non-systematic rotation of dogs","estimate","increased illness","shelter management practices","stressful environment of animal shelters","occurrence of nasal","time","intake","curiosity scores","behavioral observations","anxiety scores","behavioral assessment","correlational study","collection of urinary cortisol","repeated clinical exams","low mortality rates","rectal temperature","vaccinations","creatinine","significant challenges","basic PLS Path regression model","ocular discharge","small percentage","turn","presence of coughing","observation periods","stay","improved live-release outcomes","Individual variability","physiology of animals","kennels","ratio","sociability","accounting","infectious nature","sneezing","Activity","Limitations","day","aim"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies on enveloped viruses have shown that many incorporated cellular proteins associated with the virion\u0027s membranes that might play important roles in viral infectivity. In this study, we sought to proteomically profile the cellular proteins incorporated into or associated with the virions of a highly virulent PRRSV strain GDBY1, and to provide foundation for further investigations on the roles of incorporated/associated cellular proteins on PRRSV\u0027s infectivity. RESULTS: In our experiment, sixty one cellular proteins were identified in highly purified PRRSV virions by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometric approaches. The identified cellular proteins could be grouped into eight functional categories including cytoskeletal proteins, chaperones, macromolecular biosynthesis proteins, metabolism-associated proteins, calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins and other functional proteins. Among the identified proteins, four have not yet been reported in other studied envelope viruses, namely, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase, peroxiredoxin 1 and galectin-1 protein. The presence of five selected cellular proteins (i.e., \u03B2-actin, Tubulin, Annexin A2, heat shock protein Hsp27, and calcium binding proteins S100) in the highly purified PRRSV virions was validated by Western blot and immunogold labeling assays. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the present study has demonstrated the incorporation of cellular proteins in PRRSV virions, which provides valuable information for the further investigations for the effects of individual cellular proteins on the viral replication, assembly, and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2010-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Chengwen; Xue, Chunyi; Li, Yan; Kong, Qingming; Ren, Xiangpeng; Li, Xiaoming; Shu, Dingming; Bi, Yingzuo; Cao, Yongchang","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf665ea806b5a1b271c377e3826bf9d8bd0ebf9f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2949843.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20849641/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified proteins","functional proteins","incorporated cellular proteins","identified cellular proteins","cytoskeletal proteins","incorporation of cellular proteins","selected cellular proteins","metabolism-associated proteins","effects of individual cellular proteins","macromolecular biosynthesis proteins","calcium binding proteins S100","guanine nucleotide-binding proteins","calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins","purified PRRSV virions","roles of incorporated","virulent PRRSV strain GDBY1","enveloped viruses","monooxygenase","investigations","viral infectivity","important roles","viral replication","functional categories","PRRSV\u0027s infectivity","present study","respiratory syndrome virus","studied envelope viruses","heat shock protein Hsp27","chaperones","Annexin A2","two-dimensional gel electrophoresis","Western blot","Tubulin","severe economic consequences","tyrosine","\u03B2-actin","virion\u0027s membranes","mass spectrometric approaches","immunogold labeling assays","swine industry","BACKGROUND","peroxiredoxin","foundation","tryptophan","assembly","valuable information","proteomically profile","pathogenesis","Previous studies","galectin","experiment","presence","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The policy and principles we propose bear relevance beyond the EVD epidemic, offering guidance for the care of patients with other highly contagious, virulent, and lethal diseases. The policy establishes (1) a limited code status for patients with confirmed or suspected EVD. Limited code status means that a code blue will not be called for patients with confirmed or suspected EVD at any stage of the disease; however, properly protected providers (those already in full protective equipment) may initiate resuscitative efforts if, in their clinical assessment, these efforts are likely to benefit the patient. The policy also requires that (2) resuscitation not be attempted for patients with advanced EVD, as resuscitation would be medically futile; (3) providers caring for or having contact with patients with confirmed or suspected EVD be properly protected and trained; (4) the treating team identify and treat in advance likely causes of cardiac and respiratory arrest to minimize the need for emergency response; (5) patients with EVD and their proxies be involved in care discussions; and (6) care team and provider discretion guide the care of patients with EVD.

Data were used from a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial into the efficacy of influenza vaccination in which smoking status was measured 10 weeks after the start of the trial. A total of 1838 subjects aged 60 years or older, of whom 1531 subjects (321 smokers, 1152 non-smokers and 58 cigar/pipe smokers) who returned the smoking questionnaire and were not previously vaccinated, were used in the analyses. The main outcome measures were serological influenza (fourfold increase of antibody titre between 3 weeks and 5 months after vaccination); clinical influenza as determined by criteria of the Dutch Sentinel Stations from self reported symptoms in postal questionnaires 10 weeks and 5 months after vaccination; increases after vaccination and decreases after 5 months in logarithmic titres of antibody against the vaccine strains. No relation between smoking and either serological or clinical influenza was found, although the risk for serological influenza was slightly (not significantly) elevated in smokers compared to non-smokers. A statistical interaction was found between smoking and vaccination when serological influenza was the outcome measure indicating that the efficacy of vaccination was greater in smokers than in non-smokers (comparison of model with and without interaction; likelihood ratio test, p\u003C0.0001). This finding is supported by a greater titre rise 3 weeks after vaccination for two out of four strains, but not by the antibody response after vaccination in previous studies on influenza and other infectious diseases. Also, this possible difference of immunogenicity is not reflected in a better protection for clinical influenza. The rise in antibody titre 3 weeks after vaccination was higher in smokers for A/Singapore/6/86 and B/Beijing/11/87, but not for the other two strains. Decline in titres after 5 months was similar for smokers and non-smokers. We conclude that smoking has no clinical or preventive significance for risk of influenza in the elderly.","publish_time":"1999-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruijff, Mark; Thijs, Carel; Govaert, Theofiel; Aretz, Karin; Dinant, Geert Jan; Knottnerus, Andr\u00E9","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9630b95696daa16ef7377ab2fb1373b4cdf86058.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130566.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X98002138; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X98002138","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["A/Singapore"],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["efficacy of influenza vaccination","serological influenza","clinical influenza","risk of influenza","efficacy of vaccination","influenza season","occurrence of influenza","weeks","months","non-smokers","antibody response","pipe smokers","smoking questionnaire","cigarette smoking","logarithmic titres of antibody","fourfold increase of antibody titre","greater titre","subjects","vaccine strains","relation","rise","statistical interaction","main outcome measures","randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial","self reported symptoms","Dutch Sentinel Stations","postal questionnaires","previous studies","family practices","criteria","preventive significance","South-Limburg","likelihood ratio test","Singapore","Netherlands","comparison of model","infectious diseases","better protection","years","status","possible difference of immunogenicity","Beijing","Data","total","finding","start","elderly","analyses"],"language":"en"},

Sputum is representative of the lower respiratory tract but is used rarely for viral testing. The aim of this study was to compare the detection rates of respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum using a multiplex real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR). Adults who were admitted or presented to the clinics of Gil Medical Center with acute respiratory symptoms were recruited from 1 November 2012 to 31 March 2013. Paired specimens of nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were obtained from 154 subjects, and RNA was extracted and tested for 16 different respiratory viruses using the Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). The positive rate was 53% (81/154) for nasopharyngeal swabs and 68% (105/154) for sputum (P \u003C 0.001). One hundred thirty\u2010four viruses were identified for 107 illnesses. Influenza A virus, RSV A, HRV, coronavirus OC43, and adenovirus were detected more frequently in sputum samples than in nasopharyngeal swabs (P \u003C 0.001). Importantly, 12 of 44 (27%) influenza A infections and 11 of 27 (41%) RSV infections were positive in only sputum samples. The detection rates of respiratory viruses from sputum samples were significantly higher than those from nasopharyngeal swabs in adults using real\u2010time multiplex RT\u2010PCR. These findings suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of respiratory viruses by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in patients who produce sputum.

There is growing evidence that L-type lectins are also involved in viral replication. In this study, a novel L-type lectin (named as PcL-lectin) was identified from red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clakii). Gene sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis results showed that the PcL-lectin was a kind of endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment-53 (ERGIC-53). The expression level of PcL-lectin was significantly down regulated in crayfish after challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Recombinant PcL-lectin protein facilitated the replication of WSSV in crayfish. In addition, WSSV replication was decreased when endogenous PcL-lectin was knocked down by RNA interference in crayfish. Furthermore, PcL-lectin may interact with VP24, an envelope protein of WSSV. Our results suggest that PcL-lectin may be required for the multiplication of WSSV, and will pave a new way for the developing of strategies against WSSV infection.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dai, Yunjia; Wang, Yuqing; Zhao, Lingling; Qin, Zhendong; Yuan, Junfa; Qin, Qiwei; Lin, Li; Lan, Jiangfeng","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9147e44d2b1d43e2f0b9f0182d2e220691bae4bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111660.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464816303254; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.05.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27208793/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464816303254","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WSSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endogenous PcL-lectin","Recombinant PcL-lectin protein","replication of WSSV","WSSV replication","WSSV infection","multiplication of WSSV","envelope protein of WSSV","expression level of PcL","type lectins","red swamp crayfish","viral replication","phylogenetic tree analysis results","kind of endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment","Gene sequencing","developing of strategies","VP24","white spot syndrome virus","Procambarus clakii","glycoproteins secretory pathways","new way","ERGIC","RNA interference","study","evidence","addition","immune responses"],"language":"en"},

HCP significantly suppressed the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03B1 and decreased mucosubstances in goblet cells, but restored the level of zonula occludens-1 in intestine. HCP also reversed the composition change of intestinal microbiota caused by H1N1 infection, with significantly reduced relative abundances of Vibrio and Bacillus, the pathogenic bacterial genera. Furthermore, HCP rebalanced the gut microbiota and restored the intestinal homeostasis to some degree. The inhibition of inflammation was associated with the reduced level of Toll-like receptors and interleukin-1\u03B2 in intestine, as well as the increased production of interleukin-10. Oral administration of HCP alleviated lung injury and intestinal dysfunction caused by H1N1 infection. HCP may gain systemic treatment by local acting on intestine and microbiota.

METHODS: A total of 3,527 Hong Kong Chinese adults were interviewed by telephone within the framework of six identical cross-sectional surveys carried out during the 28-month study period. Given a hypothetical scenario that two to three new human-to-human H5N1 cases had been reported in Hong Kong, the trends of the respondents in various H5N1-related risk perceptions, anticipated personal psychological responses, and anticipated personal preventive behaviors were investigated. RESULTS: Over time, a decreased proportion of the respondents (1) felt susceptible to contracting H5N1, (2) expected a large outbreak would eventually occur, (3) believed that the impacts of H5N1 were worse than those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and (4) anticipated adopting more types of preventive measures and experiencing mental distress in the case of a small-scale outbreak in Hong Kong (AOR from 0.27 to 0.43, p \u003C 0.001), but the public remained vigilant on public health behaviors, such as hand-washing. The prevalence of misconceptions on the mode of transmission declined, but remained high; perceptions on the fatality of H5N1 remained largely underestimated. The SARS experience and unconfirmed beliefs about the transmission modes were associated with variables on anticipated preventive behaviors and emotional distress. CONCLUSION: Starting in 2005 through to 2008, respondents perceived a decreasing level of susceptibility, severity, and anticipated stress towards a hypothetical human-to-human H5N1 outbreak, possibly due to the low efficiency of transmission. The public\u2019s general preparedness was still relatively good and rational, even though individual preventive behaviors were less common. However, misconceptions were prevalent among the respondents. Based on these results, public education is warranted to rectify these misconceptions.","publish_time":"2010-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"F. Lau, J. T.; Tsui, H. Y.; Kim, J. H.; Chan, P. K.

Positive selection was not detected and mutation rates ranged from 10\u22124 to 10\u22126 substitutions/site/year for Mass and Conn IBV types where attenuated live vaccines are routinely used to control the disease.

Lower levels of genetic diversity among the Mass and Conn viruses as well as sequence similarities with vaccine virus genomes suggest that the origin of the Mass and all but one of the Conn viruses was likely vaccine virus that had been circulating in the field for an unknown but apparently short period of time. The genetic data also identified a recombinant IBV isolate with 7 breakpoints distributed across the entire genome suggesting that viruses within the same serotype can have a high degree of genetic variability outside of the spike gene. These data are important because inaccurate measures of genetic diversity and mutation rates could lead to underestimates of the ability of IBV to change and potentially emerge to cause disease.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"McKinley, Enid T.; Jackwood, Mark W.; Hilt, Deborah A.; Kissinger, Jessica C.; Robertson, Jon S.; Lemke, Cornelia; Paterson, Andrew H.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f365f69d078d7df9cad82358a631ec57dba34957.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114461.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21539870/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211001420; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.04.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211001420","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Conn IBV","Conn"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Massachusetts"],"keyphrases":["Conn viruses","mutation rates","Conn IBV types","vaccine virus genomes","genetic data","likely vaccine virus","recombinant IBV","ability of IBV","year period","CAL type viruses","infectious bronchitis virus","inaccurate measures of genetic diversity","Lower levels of genetic diversity","Positive selection","site","substitutions","disease","high degree of genetic variability","different types","field isolates","full-length genomes","entire genome","short period of time","sequence similarities","attenuated live vaccines","Massachusetts","breakpoints","fold higher ranging","Connecticut","level of polymorphisms","underestimates","origin","serotype","spike gene","contrast","California"],"language":"en"},

However, the folding and modification requirements of complex proteins place a severe constraint on the type of protein that can be successfully displayed using this strategy, a restriction that could be resolved by similarly engineering a eukaryotic virus for display purposes. The quite recently established eukaryotic molecular biology tool, the baculovirus display vector system (BDVS), allows combination of genotype with phenotype and thereby enables presentation of eukaryotic proteins on the viral envelope or capsid. Data have shown that the baculovirus, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), is a versatile tool for eukaryotic virus display. Insertion of heterologous peptides and/or proteins into the viral surface by utilizing the major envelope glycoprotein gp64, or foreign membrane\u2010derived counterparts, allows incorporation of the sequence of interest onto the surface of infected cells and virus particles. A number of strategies are being investigated in order to further develop the display capabilities of AcMNPV and improve the complexity of a library that may be accommodated. Numerous expression vectors for various approaches of surface display have already been developed. Further improvement of both insertion and selection strategies toward development of a refined tool for use in the creation of useful eukaryotic libraries is, however, needed. Here, the status of baculovirus display with respect to alteration of virus tropism, antigen presentation, transgene expression in mammalian cells, and development of eukaryotic libraries will be reviewed.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00E4kel\u00E4, Anna R.; Oker\u2010Blom, Christian","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7d8d6154bca02cc6868159cef4f7551bd9ddb89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112267.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352706680032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352706680032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eukaryotic virus display","phage display","display purposes","presentation of eukaryotic proteins","status of baculovirus display","development of eukaryotic libraries","display capabilities of AcMNPV","baculovirus display vector system","various approaches of surface display","eukaryotic molecular biology tool","creation of useful eukaryotic libraries","viral surface","virus particles","refined tool","versatile tool","alteration of virus tropism","surface of infected cells","viral envelope","selection strategies","diverse libraries","antigen presentation","transgene expression","mammalian cells","modification requirements of complex proteins","number of strategies","Numerous expression vectors","Insertion of heterologous peptides","major envelope glycoprotein gp64","foreign membrane","large variety of genes","novel functions","BDVS","respect","severe constraint","derived counterparts","Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus","incorporation","combination of genotype","folding","phenotype","type of protein","complexity","sequence","immense value","decade","improvement","order","capsid","Abstract","strategy","restriction","library","Data"],"language":"en"},

Serological and genetic tests for bovine leukemia virus (BLV) were performed because the calf was born from a cow infected with BLV. The serum had a weakly positive BLV antibody, and the BLV provirus was detected within neoplastic cells on performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analysis of the BLV provirus integration site using inverse PCR revealed that the BLV integration site location was identical on all chromosomes in all tumor tissues examined. Thus, the tumor cells monoclonally proliferated following BLV infection.

In response, the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation (with support from PricewaterhouseCoopers) coordinated subject matter experts to create a preparedness plan for Disease X. Disease X is caused by Pathogen X, an infectious agent that is not currently known to cause human disease, but an aetiologic agent of a future outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential. We have identified crucial areas for acceleration in medical countermeasure product development and international coordination. We have also reviewed novel platforms and process improvements related to manufacturing, which could revolutionise the response to the next pandemic. Finally, we created several coordination and engagement guides. These guides range from the rational design of an intervention target product profile, to the key facets of vaccine and therapeutic development, to accelerated manufacturing and regulatory mechanisms. In this Personal View, we provide a high-level summary of the outcomes of the medical countermeasure development workstream, intended for a broad audience including academia, medical countermeasure developers, and multilateral coordinating bodies. We hope that they might find this piece useful in prioritising strategic investments and efforts to accelerate medical countermeasure development.

Since experimentation is far easier in vitro, researchers have been sought to develop in vitro assays that are expected to predict activity in vivo. This could be important in both vaccine design and in passive antibody administration. The proposed mechanisms of in vitro neutralization range from those requiring binding of a single antibody molecule to virus to those requiring substantially complete antibody coating of virus. In vitro, antiviral activity can be separated into activity against virions and activity against infected cells. The activity against virions most often considered is neutralization that can be defined as the loss of infectivity, which ensues when antibody molecule(s) bind to a virus particle, and occurs without the involvement of any other agency. In vivo, it is conventional to distinguish phenomenologically between two types of antibody antiviral activity. One of them is the ability of antibody to protect against infection when it is present before or immediately following infection. Evidence for a number of viruses in vitro indicates that lower antibody concentrations are required to inhibit infection propagated by free virus than are required to inhibit infection propagated by cell-to-cell spread.","publish_time":"2001-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parren, Paul W.H.I.; Burton, Dennis R.","journal":"Advances in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ac3fd7c906edf9eecef4c6d7a3b5fc3d3546ec0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065277601770186; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065277601770186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of antibody","types of antibody antiviral activity","antiviral activities of antibody","infection","single antibody molecule","complete antibody coating of virus","passive antibody administration","lower antibody concentrations","virus particle","free virus","virions","requiring binding","neutralization range","vaccine design","number of viruses","chapter","infected cells","proposed mechanisms of","experimentation","researchers","involvement","Publisher Summary","Evidence","loss of infectivity","agency","assays"],"language":"en"},

Currently, no protective vaccine or effective treatment for the disease is available. Studies have found that some cats survive the challenge of virulent FCoV isolates. Since cellular immunity is thought to be critical in preventing FIP and because diseased cats often show a significant decrease in interferon-\u03B3 (IFN-\u03B3) production, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the feline IFN-\u03B3 gene (fIFNG) are associated with the outcome of infection. A total of 82 asymptomatic and 63 FIP cats were analyzed, and 16 SNP were identified in intron 1 of fIFNG. Among these SNP, the fFING \u002B 428 T allele was shown to be a FIP-resistant allele (p = 0.03), and the heterozygous genotypes 01C/T and \u002B408C/T were found to be FIP-susceptible factors (p = 0.004). Furthermore, an fIFNG \u002B 428 resistant allele also showed a clear correlation with the plasma level of IFN-\u03B3 in FIP cats. For the identification of these three FIP-related SNP, genotyping methods were established using amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), and the different genotypes could easily be identified without sequencing. The identification of additional FIP-related SNP will allow the selection of resistant cats and decrease the morbidity of the cat population to FIP.","publish_time":"2014-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Li-En; Chueh, Ling-Ling","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdd4a8a3507c4df13f06d8693ce8d6b4e9d6c3af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4041894.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-45-57; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIP cats","FIP-resistant allele","identification of additional FIP-related SNP","FIP-susceptible factors","diseased cats","selection of resistant cats","fIFNG","feline IFN-\u03B3 gene","interferon-\u03B3","feline coronavirus","plasma level of IFN","Feline infectious peritonitis","ARMS-PCR","lethal disease","significant decrease","heterozygous genotypes","different genotypes","outcome of infection","single nucleotide polymorphisms","restriction fragment length polymorphisms","challenge of virulent FCoV isolates","amplification refractory mutation system PCR","genotyping methods","RFLP","clear correlation","effective treatment","production","morbidity","protective vaccine","cat population","fFING","cellular immunity","total","intron","sequencing","Studies"],"language":"en"},

A number of factors, including limited radiotherapy resources, waiting times, and patient convenience, suggest single fraction to be the treatment of choice for patients. However, international patterns of practice indicate that multiple fractions are still commonly used. This study examined whether dose-fractionation schemes used for the treatment of bone metastases at the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program (RRRP) at the Odette Cancer Centre have changed since 1999. Materials and methods A retrospective review of the prospective RRRP database and hospital records were conducted for all patients treated with palliative radiotherapy for uncomplicated bone metastases at the RRRP in 1999 (or baseline), 2001, 2004 and from 1 January to 31 July 2005. Data were collected on patient demographics and clinical characteristics. Results Of the 693 patients, 65 and 35% were prescribed single fraction (predominantly single 8Gy) and multiple fractions (predominantly 20Gy/five fractions), respectively. The administration of single treatments generally increased over time, from 51% in 1999 to 66% in 2005 (P =0.0001). On the basis of multiple logistic regression analyses, patients were more likely to be prescribed single-fraction radiotherapy if they had prostate cancer, had a poorer performance status, were treated to the limbs, hips, shoulders, pelvis, ribs, scapula, sternum, or clavicle (compared with the spine), were treated by a radiation oncologist who had been trained in earlier years, and who were treated after 1999. Conclusions Between 1999 and 2005, the use of single-fraction radiotherapy increased, corresponding to publications showing equal efficacy of pain relief between single and multiple fractions in the management of uncomplicated bone metastases. However, about a third of patients still received multiple fractions.","publish_time":"2008-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bradley, N.M.E.; Husted, J.; Sey, M.S.L.; Sinclair, E.; Li, K. K.; Husain, A.

These networks range from those involving gene regulatory and protein-protein interactions underlying intracellular signaling pathways and single cell responses to increasingly complex networks of in vivo cellular interaction, positioning and migration that determine the overall immune response of an organism. Immunity is thus not the product of simple signaling events but rather non-linear behaviors arising from dynamic, feedback-regulated interactions among many components. One of the major goals of systems immunology is to quantitatively measure these complex multi-scale spatial and temporal interactions, permitting development of computational models that can be used to predict responses to perturbation. Recent technological advances permit collection of comprehensive datasets at multiple molecular and cellular levels while advances in network biology support representation of the relationships of components at each level as physical or functional interaction networks. The latter facilitate effective visualization of patterns and recognition of emergent properties arising from the many interactions of genes, molecules, and cells of the immune system. We illustrate the power of integrating \u2018omics\u2019 and network modeling approaches for unbiased reconstruction of signaling and transcriptional networks with a focus on applications involving the innate immune system. We further discuss future possibilities for reconstruction of increasingly complex cellular and organism-level networks and development of sophisticated computational tools for prediction of emergent immune behavior arising from the concerted action of these networks.","publish_time":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subramanian, Naeha; Torabi-Parizi, Parizad; Gottschalk, Rachel A.; Germain, Ronald N.; Dutta, Bhaskar","journal":"Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aac5b10701e2ab2a8492cdb597d2bacc74773d1f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c5a3f59acc0fa5ee5a3ffdcfc43cc57cac93934a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4339634.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/wsbm.1288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25625853/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4339634?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complex networks of","transcriptional networks","organismal networks","organism-level networks","functional interaction networks","innate immune system","mammalian immune system","cellular interaction","protein-protein interactions","cellular levels","temporal interactions","interactions of genes","dynamic multi-scale system","overall immune response","prediction of emergent immune behavior","complex multi-scale spatial","feedback-regulated interactions","development of computational models","development of sophisticated computational tools","unbiased reconstruction","relationships of components","network modeling approaches","organized set of molecular","recognition of emergent properties","single cell responses","effective visualization of patterns","effective host defense","network biology support representation","Recent technological advances permit collection of comprehensive datasets","pathways","migration","applications","non-linear behaviors","omics\u2019","focus","positioning","gene regulatory","concerted action","events","cells","molecules","product of simple","future possibilities","major goals of systems immunology","power","Immunity","perturbation"],"language":"en"},

Initial short sequences of the E1 and L1 genes of this virus were retrieved by PCR with degenerate papillomavirus-specific primers, and the entire R. aegyptiacus papillomavirus type 1 (RaPV-1) DNA was then amplified by long template PCR, cloned and sequenced with a transposon insertion method. The RaPV-1 genome counts 7970 basepairs and contains the typical papillomavirus open reading frames (ORF) (E1, E2, E4, E6, E7, L1 and L2). Based on a concatenated alignment of the E1, E2, L1 and L2 open reading frames of RaPV-1 and 46 other human and animal papillomavirus type species, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. This phylogenetic analysis shows that RaPV-1 has a close-to-root position in the papillomavirus evolutionary tree. Since RaPV-1 is only distantly related to other papillomaviruses (with maximally 50% nucleotide sequence identity across the L1 open reading frame), it cannot be assigned to one of the existing papillomavirus genera and therefore represents the first member of a novel, as yet unnamed, close-to-root papillomavirus genus. This is the first time a papillomavirus has been isolated and characterized from a member of the Chiroptera order.","publish_time":"2006-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rector, Annabel; Mostmans, Sara; Van Doorslaer, Koenraad; McKnight, Christy A.; Maes, Roger K.; Wise, Annabel G.; Kiupel, Matti; Van Ranst, Marc","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/765e48fe5e2a88dc5d90218b231e72f52bffede9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127635.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113506002379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113506002379","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel papillomavirus","aegyptiacus papillomavirus type","root papillomavirus genus","papillomavirus evolutionary tree","existing papillomavirus genera","typical papillomavirus open reading frames","animal papillomavirus type species","E1","L2 open reading frames of RaPV","degenerate papillomavirus-specific primers","L1 open reading frame","L1 genes","E2","phylogenetic tree","member","root position","Rousettus aegyptiacus","phylogenetic analysis","complete genomic DNA","long template PCR","ORF","E6","neighbor","Egyptian fruit bat","nucleotide sequence identity","wing","E7","E4","basepairs","Initial short sequences","basosquamous carcinoma","concatenated alignment","transposon insertion method","Chiroptera order","genome","papillomaviruses","time"],"language":"en"},

Among the respiratory viruses that can affect the lung and cause ARDS, pandemic viruses head the list, with influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1 2009 being the most recently identified. However, other viruses can cause severe ARDS. Notably, a novel coronavirus was responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003. Apart from these pandemic viruses, respiratory viruses are rarely responsible for viral pneumonia and ARDS. Other than antiviral drug (mainly oseltamivir) administration and avoidance of corticosteroids, management of ARDS due to these viruses does not differ from that for ARDS caused by other diseases. Among Herpesviridae, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are the two viruses causing nosocomial viral pneumonia that can evolve into ARDS. HSV is frequently recovered in the respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients and can sometimes be responsible for HSV bronchopneumonitis. Although not evaluated for this indication, acyclovir can be a therapeutic option for patients with HSV bronchopneumonitis and ARDS. CMV pneumonia can also occur in mechanically ventilated patients, but is difficult to diagnose because virus recovery does not necessarily mean viral disease. Ganciclovir can be considered for patients with ARDS and histology- or cytology-proven CMV pneumonia.","publish_time":"2011-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luyt, Charles-\u00C9douard; Combes, Alain; Trouillet, Jean-Louis; Nieszkowska, Ania; Chastre, Jean","journal":"Presse Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98c4330cf895a59a887bf48f6347111e00776f2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125714.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lpm.2011.05.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0755498211004933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22094172/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0755498211004933","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","cause ARDS","pandemic viruses","severe ARDS","management of ARDS","nosocomial viral pneumonia","viral diseases","influenza viruses H5N1","respiratory tract","ventilated patients","HSV bronchopneumonitis","acute respiratory distress syndrome","cytology-proven CMV pneumonia","severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak","virus types","Herpesviridae","virus recovery","herpes simplex virus","administration","list","community","lung","therapeutic option","oseltamivir","avoidance of corticosteroids","histology","cytomegalovirus","novel coronavirus","antiviral drug","acyclovir","H1N1","indication","Ganciclovir"],"language":"en"},

With high CAP numbers in China and growing access to PICUs, factors associated with severe CAP need to be determined to optimize care. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively determine PICU CAP admission features and outcomes. METHODS: A 4 year prospective study of CAP aged 1 month to \u003C14 years admitted to PICU, Children\u0027s Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, China. All were managed in a standard manner. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings were collected systematically. All received antibiotics. RESULTS: Eight hundred ten (7%) of 10,836 CAP hospital admissions needed PICU. Seven hundred seven (87%) were enrolled. PICU CAP children were young (76% \u2264 12 months) and 33% had co\u2010morbid conditions; 21% congenital heart disease.21% required mechanical ventilation. The average length of PICU stay was 5 days (range, 3\u201327). The case fatality rate was 5.8%. Viruses were detected in 38%, RSV 24%; bacteria in 23%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 7%, Haemophilus influenza b 4%, Mycoplasma 11%. On single factor analysis, PICU admission respiratory rate \u003E70/min, grunting/groaning, head nodding, cyanosis, and anemia were associated with respiratory failure and with fatality. On multivariate analysis only presence of congenital heart disease, Trisomy 21 and immunodeficiency correlated with fatality; not microbe nor PICU findings. CONCLUSIONS: Young age and underlying congenital heart disease were associated factors for PICU support in CAP in China. Early referral if altered sensorium, high respiratory rate, head nodding, grunting and anemia, and universal access to conjugated vaccines may decrease morbidity and mortality.

The diversity of coronaviruses in many mammalian species is contributed by relatively high mutation and recombination rates during replication. This dynamic nature of coronaviruses may facilitate cross-species transmission and shifts in tissue or cell tropism in a host, resulting in substantial change in virulence. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causes inapparent or mild enteritis in cats, but a highly fatal disease, called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), can arise through mutation of FECV to FIP virus (FIPV). The pathogenesis of FIP is intimately associated with immune responses and involves depletion of T cells, features shared by some other coronaviruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. The increasing risks of highly virulent coronavirus infections in humans or animals call for effective antiviral drugs, but no such measures are yet available. Previously, we have reported the inhibitors that target 3C-like protease (3CLpro) with broad-spectrum activity against important human and animal coronaviruses. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of our 3CLpro inhibitor in laboratory cats with FIP. Experimental FIP is 100% fatal once certain clinical and laboratory signs become apparent. We found that antiviral treatment led to full recovery of cats when treatment was started at a stage of disease that would be otherwise fatal if left untreated. Antiviral treatment was associated with a rapid improvement in fever, ascites, lymphopenia and gross signs of illness and cats returned to normal health within 20 days or less of treatment. Significant reduction in viral titers was also observed in cats. These results indicate that continuous virus replication is required for progression of immune-mediated inflammatory disease of FIP. These findings may provide important insights into devising therapeutic strategies and selection of antiviral compounds for further development for important coronaviruses in animals and humans.","publish_time":"2016-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yunjeong; Liu, Hongwei; Galasiti Kankanamalage, Anushka C.; Weerasekara, Sahani; Hua, Duy H.; Groutas, William C.; Chang, Kyeong-Ok; Pedersen, Niels C.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c10d2b72f8d450209946e805ba18154c9a6c5f7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4814111.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27027316/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005531","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FECV","FIP","Experimental FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["important coronaviruses","FIP virus","antiviral treatment","animal coronaviruses","diversity of coronaviruses","laboratory cats","Experimental FIP","pathogenesis of FIP","inflammatory disease of FIP","animals","humans","fatal disease","recovery of cats","dynamic nature of coronaviruses","important insights","important human","laboratory signs","mutation of FECV","selection of antiviral compounds","Feline enteric coronavirus","effective antiviral drugs","stage of disease","virulent coronavirus infections","continuous virus replication","CLpro inhibitor","therapeutic strategies","high mutation","progression of immune","immune responses","mammalian species","therapeutic efficacy","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","gross signs of illness","cross-species transmission","feline infectious peritonitis","ascites","lymphopenia","broad-spectrum activity","inapparent","development","host","fever","tissue","rapid improvement","depletion of T cells","increasing risks","recombination rates","viral titers","normal health","features","mild enteritis","wide range of diseases","cell tropism","substantial change","Significant reduction","protease","measures","days","results","FIPV","virulence","findings","inhibitors"],"language":"en"},

The human origin of these proteins ensures excellent efficacy and compatibility but may also introduce the risk of unintentional disease transmission. Historically, only viruses, particularly hepatitis and HIV, have posed serious threats to the safety of these therapeutics. Fortunately, between 1970 and 1990, the molecular biology of each of the major viruses was elucidated. These advances led to the development and implementation of effective donor screening tests, mainly based on immunoassays and nucleic acid testing, which resulted in a significant reduction of disease transmission risk. In addition, viral inactivation and removal steps were implemented and validated by manufacturers, further reducing the risk associated with known, as well as unidentified, viruses. Since the late 1990s, a different class of transmissible agent, referred to as prions, has been identified as a new risk for disease transmission. However, prion diseases are very rare, and prion transmission through plasma-derived proteins has not been reported to date. The prion-related risk is minimized by deferring donors with certain key risk factors, and by the manufacturing processes that are capable of removing prions. Advances in science and pathogen safety-related technology, compliance with good manufacturing practices by manufacturers, and increasingly stringent regulatory oversight, has meant that plasma-derived proteins have been developed into today\u2019s highly effective therapeutics with very low risk of disease transmission.","publish_time":"2012-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Kang; Gierman, Todd M.; Hotta, JoAnn; Stenland, Christopher J.; Lee, Douglas C.; Pifat, Dominique Y.; Petteway, Steve R.","journal":"BioDrugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a3672ffdd98bf445147a88991b3cb99358606c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099715.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099715/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low risk of disease transmission","risk of unintentional disease transmission","prion-related risk","new risk","prion transmission","significant reduction of disease transmission risk","Human plasma-derived proteins","certain key risk factors","effective therapeutics","manufacturers","prion diseases","advances","prions","major viruses","pathogen safety-related technology","manufacturing processes","coagulation factors","serious threats","human origin","good manufacturing practices","implementation of effective donor screening tests","compliance","donors","immunoassays","development","science","immunoglobulins","different class of transmissible agent","today\u2019s","removal steps","excellent efficacy","addition","viral inactivation","albumin","stringent regulatory oversight","HIV","compatibility","life-threatening medical conditions","nucleic acid testing","fibrin sealants","hepatitis","molecular biology","date"],"language":"en"},

We examine the contribution of drug resistance mutations for low viral suppression in HIV-positive participants in a population-based sero-prevalence survey in rural South Africa. METHODS: We conducted HIV drug resistance genotyping and ART analyte testing on dried blood spots (DBS) from HIV-positive adults participating in a 2014 survey in North West Province. Among those with virologic failure (\u003E 5000 copies/mL), we describe frequency of DRM to protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), report association of resistance with antiretroviral therapy (ART) status, and assess resistance to first and second line therapy. Analyses are weighted to account for sampling design. RESULTS: Overall 170 DBS samples were assayed for viral load and ART analytes; 78.4% of men and 50.0% of women had evidence of virologic failure and were assessed for drug resistance, with successful sequencing of 76/107 samples. We found \u22651 DRM in 22% of participants; 47% were from samples with detectable analyte (efavirenz, nevirapine or lopinavir). Of those with DRM and detectable analyte, 60% showed high\u2013level resistance and reduced predicted virologic response to \u22651 NRTI/NNRTI typically used in first and second-line regimens. CONCLUSIONS: DRM and predicted reduced susceptibility to first and second-line regimens were common among adults with ART exposure in a rural South African population-based sample. Results underscore the importance of ongoing virologic monitoring, regimen optimization and adherence counseling to optimize durable virologic suppression.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lippman, Sheri A.; Mooney, Alyssa C.; Puren, Adrian; Hunt, Gillian; Grignon, Jessica S.; Prach, Lisa M.; Gilmore, Hailey J.; Truong, Hong-Ha M.; Barnhart, Scott; Liegler, Teri","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5484436a32fa87a1bcf03c41e8e224a0c2e0515e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099808.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099808/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV","DRM","DBS"],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["contribution of HIV drug resistance mutations","level resistance","contribution of drug resistance mutations","report association of resistance","HIV-positive adults","HIV-positive participants","HIV treatment","evidence of virologic failure","frequency of DRM","ART analyte testing","durable virologic suppression","predicted virologic response","ART exposure","ART analytes","detectable analyte","DBS samples","line therapy","line regimens","non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors","protease inhibitors","importance of ongoing virologic monitoring","NNRTI","virological failure","RESULTS","low viral suppression","rural South African population-based sample","population-based sero-prevalence survey","viral load","antiretroviral therapy","reduced susceptibility","adherence counseling","regimen optimization","dried blood spots","efavirenz","nevirapine","women","status","successful sequencing","account","North West Province","BACKGROUND","factors","lopinavir","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","sampling design","Analyses","copies"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiological evidence indicates the impact of RSV in older adults may be similar to nonpandemic influenza, both in the community and in long-term care facilities.

Estimates using US healthcare databases and viral surveillance results over a 9-year period indicate that RSV infection causes approximately 10 000 all-cause deaths annually among persons \u003E64 years of age. In contrast, influenza A accounted for approximately 37 000 yearly deaths in the same age group. The clinical features of RSV infection may be difficult to distinguish from those of influenza but include nasal congestion, cough, wheezing and low-grade fever. Older persons with underlying heart and lung disease and immunocompromised patients are at highest risk for RSV infection-related pneumonia and death. Diagnosis of RSV infection in adults is difficult because viral culture and antigen detection are insensitive, presumably because of low viral titres. The combination of serology and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay offers the best sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of RSV but unfortunately these techniques are not widely available; consequently, most adult RSV disease goes unrecognised. Although treatment of RSV infection in the elderly is largely supportive, early therapy with ribavirin and intravenous \u03B3-globulin improves survival in immunocompromised persons. An effective RSV vaccine has not yet been developed.

The sequence of events leading to NEC is complex and multifactorial, although damage to the intestinal epithelium and invasion by bacteria are known to play central roles in disease pathogenesis. STUDY DESIGN: Bacteria initiate a cascade of inflammation that may progress to intestinal necrosis and perforation with sepsis and death. RESULT: Treatment of infants at risk for NEC with probiotic bacteria may be an area of great potential, as probiotic bacteria may promote maturation of the epithelial barrier and function to exclude bacterial pathogens from critical niches in the intestine, thereby disrupting a primary pathway in disease pathogenesis.

It is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. In 1996 the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for empirical therapy of HAP. This review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ATS statement. Early diagnosis of HAP and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. Since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. Endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic BAL/PSB in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Since culture results take 2\u20133 days, initial therapy of HAP is by definition empirical. Epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus (\u2018core pathogens\u2019). Empirical therapy covering only the \u2018core pathogens\u2019 will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. Studies that have appeared since the ATS statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for HAP with multiresistant pathogens. In patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. The most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of HAP (\u22655 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus- baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum \u03B2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. To further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. Antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance. Since the ATS statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. Therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for HAP should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.","publish_time":"2012-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andriesse, Gunnar I.; Verhoef, Jan","journal":"Treat Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b939ec4f8d611cfb7dcd6268ce5d10862fe8997.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100095.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100095/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":["American Thoracic Society","HAP","ATS","BAL/PSB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["empirical therapy of HAP","initial therapy of HAP","new risk factors","important risk factors","multiresistant pathogens","definition empirical","ATS statement","patients","late onset of HAP","pharmacological factors","Early diagnosis of HAP","antibacterials","recent use of antibacterial therapy","etiologic pathogens","quantitative culture","involved pathogens","methicillin-resistant","increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms","Nosocomial pneumonia","Multiresistant bacteria of specific","PSB","combination","days","detection of intracellular microorganisms","Enterobacteriaceae","culture results","hospital","core pathogens\u2019","general guidelines","formulation of local guidelines","review","specific therapeutic options","specific susceptibility pattern","ventilator-associated pneumonia","Staphylococcus aureus","new fluoroquinolones","broader spectrum","local epidemiology","important conclusions","Epidemiologic studies","non-bronchoscopic BAL","appropriate antibacterial treatment","spectrum \u03B2-lactamase","common nosocomial infection","Haemophilus influenzae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Acinetobacter calcoaceticus- baumannii","teicoplanin","Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","MRSA","etiology","leading cause of death","protected specimen brush","good alternative","quinupristin","meropenem","dalfopristin","linezolid","admission","reports","lower respiratory tract","Endotracheal aspirate","mere colonization","bronchoalveolar lavage","ESBL","outcomes","considerable morbidity","American Thoracic Society","mechanical ventilation","generation cephalosporins","account","mortality","light of developing resistance","infections","literature"],"language":"en"},

Dogs and cats with MRLN mass lesions that had undergone MRI and had a confirmed cytological or histopathological diagnosis were recruited from medical record archives.

A total of 31 patients were sampled, with 15 in the inflammatory lymphadenitis group and 16 in the neoplasia group. Patients with inflammatory lymphadenitis were more likely to be younger and present with lethargy (P = 0.001), pyrexia (P = 0.000), and neck pain (P = 0.006). Patients with inflammatory lymphadenitis were also more likely to have a leukocystosis (P = 0.02) and segmental neutrophilia (P = 0.001).

However, a single donor muscle biopsy is unlikely to provide enough cells to effectively transplant the muscle mass of a patient affected by muscular dystrophy. Expansion of cells ex vivo using traditional culture techniques significantly reduces engraftment potential. We hypothesized that activation of Notch signaling during ex vivo expansion would maintain donor cell engraftment potential. In this study, we expanded freshly isolated canine muscle-derived cells on tissue culture plates coated with Delta-1(ext)-IgG to activate Notch signaling or with human IgG as a control. A model of canine-to-murine xenotransplantation was used to quantitatively compare canine muscle cell engraftment, and determine if engrafted donor cells could function as satellite cells in vivo. We show that Delta-1(ext)-IgG inhibited differentiation of canine muscle-derived cells, and increased the level of genes normally expressed in myogenic precursors. Moreover, cells expanded on Delta-1(ext)-IgG resulted in a significant increase in the number of donor-derived fibers, as compared to cells expanded on human IgG, reaching engraftment levels similar to freshly isolated cells. Importantly, cells expanded on Delta-1(ext)-IgG engrafted to the recipient satellite cell niche, and contributed to further regeneration. A similar strategy of expanding human muscle-derived cells on Notch ligand might facilitate engraftment and muscle regeneration for patients affected with muscular dystrophy.","publish_time":"2012-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parker, Maura H.; Loretz, Carol; Tyler, Ashlee E.; Duddy, William J.; Hall, John K.; Olwin, Bradley B.; Bernstein, Irwin D.; Storb, Rainer; Tapscott, Stephen J.","journal":"STEM CELLS","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6f248da2daf3a4bc18d187d792474c40850d150.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a85bd6533482300d8a67cb7e91618935bbdc62ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3448880.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3448880?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.1181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22865615/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolated cells","satellite cells","human muscle-derived cells","isolated canine muscle-derived cells","engrafted donor cells","Expansion of cells ex","IgG inhibited differentiation of canine muscle-derived cells","canine muscle cell engraftment","muscle regeneration","muscle mass","human IgG","Transplantation of myogenic stem cells","ext","Delta","donor cell engraftment potential","single donor muscle biopsy","long-term repair of dystrophic muscle","engraftment levels similar","derived fibers","number of donor","model of canine","great potential","Notch ligand","activation of Notch","muscular dystrophy","recipient satellite cell niche","similar strategy","myogenic precursors","traditional culture techniques","tissue culture plates","patients","significant increase","level of genes","murine xenotransplantation","study","control"],"language":"en"},

Here we engineered full, partially deleted (\u221229 nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic. Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29 nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold. The effect was independent of the type I interferon response. The 29 nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted \u201CCellPhoneDB\u201D analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Furong; Qian, Shen; Zhang, Shuye; Zhang, Zheng","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22f3be8bbf6d792549b7a6088df7440e425cb34f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cc421f4dde8a2c1b1ee428845c3c34786f2d3046.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.951913","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ENPEP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human cells","human tissues","human CoVs","ACE2 partner","nCoV","candidate co-receptors","single cell co-expression spectrum","cell types","cell crosstalk","known receptors","CoVs targets","reported RNA virus receptors","single cell gene expression atlas","ileum ECs","epithelial cells","surrounding cells","different tissues","ENPEP","lung AT2","DPP4","potential receptor","ANPEP","stomach","similar expression patterns","colon colonocytes","rectum ECs","immune defense","liver cholangiocyte","immune pathogenesis","CoV-targets","virus entry","auxiliary proteins","membrane proteins","potential candidates","host receptor","importance of tissue macrophages","kidney proximal tubules","esophagus keratinocytes","expressing levels","phagocytosis","peptidases","global public health emergency","Wuhan","China","outbreak","analysis","recent reports","chemokine","new coronavirus","Hubei","CellPhoneDB","Angiotensin","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

For centuries, the herb has been employed in clinical practice for treatment of virus infection and inflammation. However, its active ingredients remain unclear. Aim of the study In the present study, the anti-influenza virus activity of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, the Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products, was firstly evaluated in vitro and in ovo and their mechanism of action was investigated. Materials and methods Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were isolated from Isatidis Radix by chiral separation. In vitro and in ovo evaluations were performed on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and embryonated eggs respectively, both using protocols including prevention, treatment and virus neutralization. Hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays were performed for further understanding of the antiviral mechanism. Results Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products all exhibited dose-dependent inhibition effect against influenza A virus (H1N1) without toxicity. The antiviral potency of the components was in the order of progoitrin \u003E goitrin \u003E epigoitrin \u003E epiprogoitrin. The attachment of the constituents to the viral envelope conduced to the mechanism of their antiviral action without disturbing viral adsorption or budding. Conclusion Taken together, these results are promising for further development of Isatidis Radix and may contribute an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for influenza virus infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nie, Li-xing; Wu, Yan-lin; Dai, Zhong; Ma, Shuang-cheng","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c02c376bdc5f9c58b34faf320090625892c5977e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126217.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.112550; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874119333562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31918015/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874119333562","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Isatidis Radix"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of Isatidis Radix","influenza virus infection","Results Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers","treatment of virus infection","virus neutralization","epigoitrin","antiviral mechanism","anti-influenza virus activity of epiprogoitrin","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Isatidis Radix","antiviral action","mechanism of action","breakdown products","order of progoitrin","methods Epiprogoitrin","antiviral potency","present study","inhibition assays","viral envelope","ovo evaluations","disturbing viral adsorption","dose-dependent inhibition effect","MDCK","sun-dried roots of Isatis indigotica Fortune ex Lindl","cells","Madin-Darby canine kidney","adjunct","neuraminidase","protocols","clinical practice","embryonated eggs","components","prevention","H1N1","pharmacotherapy","herb","constituents","Materials","inflammation","chiral separation","traditional Chinese medicines","active ingredients","Hemagglutination","attachment","toxicity","centuries","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Purpose To explore whether enhanced cooperation with local government and community institutions can effectively supplement traditional state-centric public health epidemic responses. Methods Drawing on Taiwan as a case study, we assess the role of the whole-of-society approach to epidemic response as arises from the collaborative governance literature. The approach calls for enhanced cooperation, trust building, resource sharing and consensus-oriented decision making among multiple levels of government, business, non-profits, and the public in general. Results The Taiwan case illustrates the benefits of the whole-of-society approach. Enhanced cooperation between state, local government and non-state institutions, particularly neighborhood committees, has resulted in a strengthened, holistic epidemic preparedness and response infrastructure. Conclusion The Taiwan case provides evidence that by implementing the whole-of-society approach to pandemic preparedness and response governments can enhance their ability to manage future outbreaks. We recommend that governments beyond Taiwan\u0027s borders seriously consider adopting this approach.","publish_time":"2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwartz, Jonathan; Yen, Muh-Yong","journal":"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0ae914bc90468ae1183c3affcafd91a563c6d8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105040.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28089098/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118216301463; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118216301463; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2016.08.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["society approach","enhanced cooperation","response governments","Taiwan case","local government","response infrastructure","traditional response mechanisms","non-state institutions","holistic epidemic preparedness","case study","traditional state-centric public health epidemic responses","multiple levels of government","community institutions","pandemic preparedness","resource sharing","consensus-oriented decision","trust building","time","non-profits","business","neighborhood committees","emerging infectious diseases","ability","task of prevention","collaborative governance literature","Conclusion","evidence","Taiwan\u0027s borders","Abstract Background","future outbreaks","control","role","Methods","benefits","Purpose"],"language":"en"},

It is associated with fever, lethargy, anorexia, and less frequently, colic and diarrhea. This enteric virus is transmitted via the feco-oral route and horses become infected by ingesting fecally contaminated feed and water. Various outbreaks have been reported since 2010 from Japan, Europe and the USA. While the clinical signs are fairly non-specific, lymphopenia and neutropenia are often seen. Specific diagnosis is made by the detection of ECoV in feces by either quantitative real-time PCR, electron microscopy or antigen-capture ELISA. Supportive treatment is usually required, as most infections are self-limiting. However, rare complications, such as endotoxemia, septicemia and hyperammonemia-associated encephalopathy, have been reported, and have been related to the loss of barrier function at the intestinal mucosa. This review article will focus on the latest information pertaining to the virus, epidemiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, pathology, treatment and prevention of ECoV infection in adult horses.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pusterla, N.; Vin, R.; Leutenegger, C.

The spectroscopic measurements showed that OMP in its native state at pH 7.0 exists in more stable and compact conformation. In contrast, at pH 2.0, OMP retains substantial amount of secondary structure, disrupted side chain interactions, increased hydrodynamic radii, and nearly four-fold increase in ANS fluorescence with respect to the native state, indicating that MG state exists at pH 2.0. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by acrylamide further confirmed the accumulation of a partially unfolded state between native and unfolded state. The effect of pH on the conformation and thermostability of OMP points towards its heat resistance at neutral pH (T (m) ~ 69 \u00B0C at pH 7.0, monitored by change in MRE(222 nm)). Acid unfolded state was also characterized by the lack of a cooperative thermal transition. All these results suggested that acid-induced unfolded state of OMP at pH 2.0 represented the molten globule state. The chemical denaturation studies with GuHCl and urea as denaturants showed dissimilar results. The chemical unfolding experiments showed that in both far-UV CD and fluorescence measurements, GuHCl is more efficient than urea. GuHCl is characterized by low C (m) (~1 M), while urea is characterized by high C (m) (~3 M). The fully unfolded states were reached at 2 M GuHCl and 4 M urea concentration, respectively. This study adds to several key considerations of importance in the development of therapeutic agents against typhoid fever for clinical purposes.

To investigate the prevalence and genetic evolution of diarrhea-associated viruses responsible for the outbreaks, a total of 2987 field diarrheal samples collected from 168 pig farms in five provinces in Southern China during 2012\u20132018 were tested. RESULTS: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was most frequently detected virus with prevalence rates between 50.21 and 62.10% in samples, and 96.43% (162/168) in premises, respectively. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was the second prevalent virus with prevalence rates ranging from 19.62 to 29.19% in samples, and 70.24% (118/168) in premises, respectively. Both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) were detected at low prevalence rates of \u003C 3% in samples and 10.12% in premises. In this study, we identified a newly emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) in diarrheal samples of piglets from Fujian province in Southern China, and the prevalence rate of SADS-CoV was 10.29% (7/68). Co-infections of these diarrhea-associated viruses were common. The most frequent co-infection was PEDV with PDCoV, with an average detection rate of 12.72% (380/2987, ranging from 8.26\u201317.33%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PEDVs circulating in Southern China during the last 7 years were clustered with the variant strains of PEDV in genotype IIa. The most frequent mutations were present in the collagenase equivalent (COE) and epitope regions of the spike gene of the PEDVs currently circulating in the field. Genetic relationships of PDCoVs were closely related with Chinese strains, other than those present in the USA, South Korea, Thailand and Lao\u2019s public. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicated that variant PEDV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea, and either mono-infections or co-infections of pathogenic enteric CoVs were common in pigs in Southern China during 2012\u20132018. Thus, significant attention should be paid in order to effectively prevent and control porcine viral diarrhea.","publish_time":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Fanfan; Luo, Suxian; Gu, Jun; Li, Zhiquan; Li, Kai; Yuan, Weifeng; Ye, Yu; Li, Hao; Ding, Zhen; Song, Deping; Tang, Yuxin","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba755009e5f7330a8344f1b2dd8e65d54b8488e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6935106.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2212-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31881873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Fujian","South Korea","Thailand","Southern China"],"keyphrases":["Southern China","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","diarrhea-associated viruses","etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea","control porcine viral diarrhea","genetic evolution of diarrhea","prevalence rate of SADS","SADS-CoV","variant PEDV","porcine rotavirus","Porcine deltacoronavirus","detected virus","field diarrheal samples","low prevalence rates","premises","large-scale outbreaks of severe diarrhea","variant strains of PEDV","diarrheal samples of piglets","prevalent virus","emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus","mono-infections","associated viruses responsible","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","frequent co-infection","PEDVs","pigs","study","co-infections of pathogenic enteric CoVs","Chinese strains","frequent mutations","average detection rate","Genetic relationships of PDCoVs","South Korea","collagenase equivalent","TGEV","pig farms","Fujian province","epitope regions","Thailand","COE","PoRV","total","Lao\u2019s public","spike gene","USA","order","genotype IIa","provinces","years","RESULTS","findings","BACKGROUND","Phylogenetic analysis","significant attention","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Blood samples from calves of \u003E150 d of age (n = 1,348) were analyzed for antibodies against parainfluenza virus 3, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and Mycoplasma bovis.

Our study demonstrated persisting diarrhea and prolonged fecal shedding, but with a lack of significant intestinal lesions in gnotobiotic (Gn) calves infected with GIII.2 BoNoV, CV186-OH/00/US strain. Nine 4 to 7-day-old Angus/Jersey crossbred Gn calves were orally inoculated with 10.0-11.9 log(10) genomic equivalents (GE)/calf of CV186-OH (n=7) or mock (n=2). Calves were euthanized at post-inoculation day (PID) 1 (n=1) when moderate to severe lethargy was observed and at PIDs 2-6 (n=4) after lethargy had subsided. Two calves were kept longer term (until PID 30) for monitoring fecal shedding patterns by TaqMan real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Most infected calves exhibited two clinical signs: i) acute but persisting diarrhea and ii) acute moderate to severe lethargy. The two infected calves, followed longer-term, had prolonged fecal viral RNA shedding [peak average titer of 11.8 (\u00B1 0.2) log(10) GE/ml] at least until PID 20. By qRT-PCR, 5 infected calves had low viral RNA titers in serum, ranging from 4.0 to 5.8 log(10) GE/ml, at PIDs 1-5, but not (\u003C2.7 log(10) GE/ml) at PIDs 6-30. The latter observation coincided with the presence of serum IgG antibody to BoNoV at PIDs 8-30. Collectively, the GIII.2 BoNoV strain CV186-OH induced only mild enteropathogenicity, evident by the lack of significant intestinal lesions, but it led to persisting mild diarrhea and prolonged fecal virus shedding in Gn calves.

Although it has been accepted now that chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) needs to be differentiated into CRS with and without nasal polyps, it has become clear that this distinction is insufficient to clearly define subgroups with uniform pathophysiology and cytokine patterns. While Th1-cytokines are mostly found in CRSsNP and Th2 cytokines in CRSwNP, there is a substantial overlap, and several other cytokines have also been detected. Attempts to identify CRS endotypes based on cytokines are ongoing but not yet generally accepted. Despite the central role of cytokines in rhinosinusitis, no specific cytokine-targeted therapies are currently available, and only very few studies have specifically addressed the effects of such biologicals in rhinosinusitis.","publish_time":"2015-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scheckenbach, Kathrin; Wagenmann, Martin","journal":"Curr Allergy Asthma Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5dc3af2d8f81ab42751edc2f518bbc7eb535b9a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088912.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26707380/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11882-015-0583-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Th2 cytokines","Th1-cytokines","central role of cytokines","acute rhinosinusitis","chronic rhinosinusitis","proinflammatory cytokines of different types","CRS endotypes","cytokine patterns","uniform pathophysiology","specific cytokine-targeted therapies","subgroups","key regulators of inflammation","CRSwNP","inflammatory disease","involvement","CRSsNP","area","detailed research","distinction","nasal polyps","effects","inflammasome","substantial overlap","Initial information","studies","biologicals"],"language":"en"},

Repetitiveness and clustering of contacts are known to be relevant factors influencing the transmission of droplet or contact transmitted diseases. However, we do not yet completely know under what conditions repetitiveness and clustering should be included for realistically modelling disease spread. METHODS: We compare two different types of individual-based models: One assumes random mixing without repetition of contacts, whereas the other assumes that the same contacts repeat day-by-day. The latter exists in two variants, with and without clustering. We systematically test and compare how the total size of an outbreak differs between these model types depending on the key parameters transmission probability, number of contacts per day, duration of the infectious period, different levels of clustering and varying proportions of repetitive contacts. RESULTS: The simulation runs under different parameter constellations provide the following results: The difference between both model types is highest for low numbers of contacts per day and low transmission probabilities. The number of contacts and the transmission probability have a higher influence on this difference than the duration of the infectious period. Even when only minor parts of the daily contacts are repetitive and clustered can there be relevant differences compared to a purely random mixing model. CONCLUSION: We show that random mixing models provide acceptable estimates of the total outbreak size if the number of contacts per day is high or if the per-contact transmission probability is high, as seen in typical childhood diseases such as measles. In the case of very short infectious periods, for instance, as in Norovirus, models assuming repeating contacts will also behave similarly as random mixing models. If the number of daily contacts or the transmission probability is low, as assumed for MRSA or Ebola, particular consideration should be given to the actual structure of potentially contagious contacts when designing the model.","publish_time":"2009-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smieszek, Timo; Fiebig, Lena; Scholz, Roland W","journal":"Theor Biol Med Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b15e513ac2f5696b1e51324fb0a3118c44a6a9e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2709892.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4682-6-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19563624/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of contacts","clustering of contacts","contagious contacts","repeating contacts","repetition of contacts","number of daily contacts","low numbers of contacts","varying proportions of repetitive contacts","contact transmission probability","random mixing models","transmission of droplet","model types","low transmission probabilities","key parameters transmission probability","day","duration","spread of infectious disease","different levels of clustering","based models","relevant factors","different types of individual","short infectious periods","total outbreak size","total size","social factors","biological factors","different parameter constellations","modelling disease spread","following results","relevant differences","transmitted diseases","conditions repetitiveness","typical childhood diseases","acceptable estimates","instance","higher influence","MRSA","simulation","Norovirus","arrangement","particular consideration","actual structure","minor parts","Ebola","measles","case","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSION","variants"],"language":"en"},

We compared the response of human and bat cells to poly(I:C), a viral double-stranded RNA surrogate. We measured transcripts for several inflammatory, interferon and interferon stimulated genes using quantitative real-time PCR and observed that human and bat cells both, when stimulated with poly(I:C), contained higher levels of transcripts for interferon beta than unstimulated cells. In contrast, only human cells expressed robust amount of RNA for TNF\u03B1, a cell signaling protein involved in systemic inflammation. We examined the bat TNF\u03B1 promoter and found a potential repressor (c-Rel) binding motif. We demonstrated that c-Rel binds to the putative c-Rel motif in the promoter and knocking down c-Rel transcripts significantly increased basal levels of TNF\u03B1 transcripts.

For the clinical cure criteria in China, twice successive negative results of Sars-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection are the important index, in addition to normal body temperature for 3 days as well as obvious improvement in respiratory symptoms and CT scan [2]. In the present work, we reported that Sars-Cov-2 nucleic acid was still detectable in sputum obtained by nebulization from a cured patient. On January 22, a 49-year-old man presented himself with fever for 4 days to a clinic. Throat swab detection was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the diagnostic criteria [2] as follows (1): the positive result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection (2); a history of short stay in Wuhan within 14 days; and (3) symptoms of fever, and multiple patchy areas of ground-glass opacity on CT scan. After the active treatment, the patient recovered from fever and other respiratory symptoms on February 4. On February 9 and February 10, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was successively negative in his throat swab samples. The CT scan result showed that the inflammation was significantly decreased in both lungs.

Although important progress has been made toward understanding the biology of PHEV, many aspects of its life cycle remain obscure. Here we dissected the molecular mechanism underlying cellular entry and intracellular trafficking of PHEV in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells. We first performed a thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay to characterize the kinetics of PHEV, and we found that viral entry and transfer occur via membranous coating-mediated endo- and exocytosis. To verify the roles of distinct endocytic pathways, systematic approaches were used, including pharmacological inhibition, RNA interference, confocal microscopy analysis, use of fluorescently labeled virus particles, and overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant. Quantification of infected cells showed that PHEV enters cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and that low pH, dynamin, cholesterol, and Eps15 are indispensably involved in this process. Intriguingly, PHEV invasion leads to rapid actin rearrangement, suggesting that the intactness and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are positively correlated with viral endocytosis. We next investigated the trafficking of internalized PHEV and found that Rab5- and Rab7-dependent pathways are required for the initiation of a productive infection. Furthermore, a GTPase activation assay suggested that endogenous Rab5 is activated by PHEV and is crucial for viral progression. Our findings demonstrate that PHEV hijacks the CME and endosomal system of the host to enter and traffic within neural cells, providing new insights into PHEV pathogenesis and guidance for antiviral drug design. IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus, invades the central nervous system (CNS) and causes neurological dysfunction. Neural cells are its targets for viral progression. However, the detailed mechanism underlying PHEV entry and trafficking remains unknown. PHEV is the etiological agent of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis, which is an acute and highly contagious disease that causes numerous deaths in suckling piglets and enormous economic losses in China. Understanding the viral entry pathway will not only advance our knowledge of PHEV infection and pathogenesis but also open new approaches to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we employed systematic approaches to dissect the internalization and intracellular trafficking mechanism of PHEV in Neuro-2a cells. This is the first report to describe the process of PHEV entry into nerve cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a dynamin-, cholesterol-, and pH-dependent manner that requires Rab5 and Rab7.","publish_time":"2017-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zi; Zhao, Kui; Lan, Yungang; Lv, Xiaoling; Hu, Shiyu; Guan, Jiyu; Lu, Huijun; Zhang, Jing; Shi, Junchao; Yang, Yawen; Song, Deguang; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1ab379487b829f2a3d3f78f27a427f2dd87deda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5686734.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01083-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28956766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV","CME"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PHEV pathogenesis","PHEV invasion","kinetics of PHEV","biology of PHEV","process of PHEV entry","intracellular trafficking of PHEV","trafficking of internalized PHEV","knowledge of PHEV infection","intracellular trafficking mechanism of PHEV","neural cells","nerve cells","viral endocytosis","viral entry pathway","viral progression","cellular entry","Quantification of infected cells","clathrin-mediated endocytosis","IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","systematic approaches","central nervous system","etiological agent of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis","open new approaches","CME","endogenous Rab5","CNS","endosomal system","molecular mechanism","detailed mechanism","cholesterol","Rab7-dependent pathways","dynamin","virus particles","pH-dependent manner","new insights","RNA interference","single-stranded RNA coronavirus","suckling piglets","neurovirulent coronavirus","membranous coating-mediated endo","actin cytoskeleton","low pH","productive infection","confocal microscopy analysis","GTPase activation assay","rapid actin rearrangement","section transmission electron microscopy","roles of distinct endocytic pathways","guidance","numerous deaths","enormous economic losses","pharmacological inhibition","internalization","positive-sense","overexpression","intactness","aspects","host","transfer","mouse neuroblastoma","antiviral drug design","dominant negative","contagious disease","development of novel therapeutic strategies","DN","China","initiation","targets","life cycle","mutant","dynamics","exocytosis","Eps15","neurological dysfunction","report","findings","important progress"],"language":"en"},

We screened 586 outpatients (median age 5, range 1\u201377) presenting with influenza-like-illness (ILI) at 4 sentinel sites in western Cambodia between May 2010 and December 2012. Real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT) PCR for influenza was performed on combined nasal and throat specimens followed by viral culture, antigenic analysis, antiviral susceptibility testing and full genome sequencing for phylogenetic analysis. ILI-specimens negative for influenza were cultured, followed by rRT-PCR for enterovirus and rhinovirus (EV/RV) and EV71. Influenza was found in 168 cases (29%) and occurred almost exclusively in the rainy season from June to November. Isolated influenza strains had close antigenic and phylogenetic relationships, matching vaccine and circulating strains found elsewhere in Cambodia. Influenza vaccination coverage was low (\u003C20%). Western Cambodian H1N1(2009) isolate genomes were more closely related to 10 earlier Cambodia isolates (94.4% genome conservation) than to 13 Thai isolates (75.9% genome conservation), despite sharing the majority of the amino acid changes with the Thai references. Most genes showed signatures of purifying selection. Viral culture detected only adenovirus (5.7%) and parainfluenza virus (3.8%), while non-polio enteroviruses (10.3%) were detected among 164 culture-negative samples including coxsackievirus A4, A6, A8, A9, A12, B3, B4 and echovirus E6 and E9 using nested RT-PCR methods. A single specimen of EV71 was found. Despite proximity to Thailand, influenza epidemiology of these western Cambodian isolates followed patterns observed elsewhere in Cambodia, continuing to support current vaccine and treatment recommendations from the Cambodian National Influenza Center. Amino acid mutations at non-epitope sites, particularly hemagglutinin genes, require further investigation in light of an increasingly important role of permissive mutations in influenza virus evolution. Further research about the burden of adenovirus and non-polio enteroviruses as etiologic agents in acute respiratory infections in Cambodia is also needed.","publish_time":"2016-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Timmermans, Ans; Melendrez, Melanie C.; Se, Youry; Chuang, Ilin; Samon, Nou; Uthaimongkol, Nichapat; Klungthong, Chonticha; Manasatienkij, Wudtichai; Thaisomboonsuk, Butsaya; Tyner, Stuart D.; Rith, Sareth; Horm, Viseth Srey; Jarman, Richard G.; Bethell, Delia; Chanarat, Nitima; Pavlin, Julie; Wongstitwilairoong, Tippa; Saingam, Piyaporn; El, But Sam; Fukuda, Mark M.; Touch, Sok; Sovann, Ly; Fernandez, Stefan; Buchy, Philippe; Chanthap, Lon; Saunders, David","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f3f613be264f8b10318dfe8e92777fe7a95848e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4814059.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27028323/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Influenza Center"],"locations":["Thailand","Cambodia"],"keyphrases":["influenza epidemiology","circulation of influenza","Isolated influenza strains","influenza virus evolution","Influenza vaccination coverage","Cambodian National Influenza Center","Thai-Cambodia border","earlier Cambodia isolates","western Cambodian isolates","Thai isolates","Western Cambodian H1N1","rRT-PCR","genome conservation","viral culture","non-polio enteroviruses","antigenic analysis","non-epitope sites","Amino acid mutations","phylogenetic analysis","genome sequencing","Thai references","culture-negative samples","ILI-specimens","amino acid changes","phylogenetic relationships","respiratory viruses","matching vaccine","sentinel sites","nested RT-PCR methods","hemagglutinin genes","burden of adenovirus","current vaccine","throat specimens","parainfluenza virus","acute respiratory infections","single specimen of EV71","important role of permissive mutations","etiologic agents","antiviral susceptibility testing","A6","E9","echovirus E6","coxsackievirus A4","treatment recommendations","B3","A12","B4","A9","A8","remote populations","rhinovirus","combined nasal","Real-time reverse transcriptase","investigation","light","majority","Thailand","patterns","signatures of purifying selection","proximity","illness","outpatients","median age","research","genomes","rainy season","cases"],"language":"en"},

The virulent G2b PEDV subgroup, which was responsible for the 2013\u20132014 pandemics on the American and Asian continents, hit Jeju Island in 2014, which had been PEDV-free since 2004. This study presents molecular characterization of a novel PEDV variant with a 5-amino acid (aa) insertion (DTHPE) in the spike (S) gene (an S-insertion) that was identified in diarrheic piglets from Jeju Island. The genome of the PEDV strain KOR/KNU-1601/2016 was sequenced and analyzed to characterize the S-insertion variant circulating on Jeju Island. The full-length genome sequence of KNU-1601 is 28,053 nucleotides (nt) in length, which is 24 nt and 15 nt longer than the genome sequences of G1 classical and G2 epidemic field strains, respectively. KNU-1601 shares 99.5\u201399.6% nucleotide sequence identity at the genome level and 98.0\u201398.6% amino acid sequence identity at the S gene level with other global G2b PEDV strains. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the KNU-1601 variant is most closely related to the G2b field isolates but appears to undergo continuous evolution in the field. These data advance our understanding of the genetic diversity and evolutionary characteristics of the PEDV field strains circulating in South Korea.

Reliable information that accurately describes and characterizes the global occurrence and transmission of human viruses is essential to support national and global priority setting, public health actions, and treatment decisions. However, large areas of the globe are currently without surveillance due to limited health care infrastructure and lack of international cooperation. We propose a novel surveillance strategy, using metagenomic analysis of toilet material from international air flights as a method for worldwide viral disease surveillance. The aim of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate a method for viral analysis of airplane toilet waste enabling simultaneous detection and quantification of a wide range of human viral pathogens. Toilet waste from 19 international airplanes was analyzed for viral content, using viral capture probes followed by high-throughput sequencing. Numerous human pathogens were detected including enteric and respiratory viruses. Several geographic trends were observed with samples originating from South Asia having significantly higher viral species richness as well as higher abundances of salivirus A, aichivirus A and enterovirus B, compared to samples originating from North Asia and North America. In addition, certain city specific trends were observed, including high numbers of rotaviruses in airplanes departing from Islamabad. Based on this study we believe that central sampling and analysis at international airports could be a useful supplement for global viral surveillance, valuable for outbreak detection and for guiding public health resources.","publish_time":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hjelms\u00F8, Mathis Hjort; Mollerup, Sarah; Jensen, Randi Holm; Pietroni, Carlotta; Lukjancenko, Oksana; Schultz, Anna Charlotte; Aarestrup, Frank M.; Hansen, Anders Johannes","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d2c4cd6798ba4eb5e8e062248a7853df4bc74ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6331095.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640944/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Asia","North Asia","North America","Islamabad"],"keyphrases":["global viral surveillance","viral content","viral disease surveillance","viral analysis of airplane toilet waste","wide range of human viral pathogens","viral capture probes","higher viral species richness","international airplanes","public health actions","public health resources","Numerous human pathogens","international airports","transmission of human viruses","major public health threat","metagenomic analysis of toilet material","international air flights","lack of international cooperation","global occurrence","method","novel surveillance strategy","samples","North Asia","study","limited health care infrastructure","global priority setting","simultaneous detection","outbreak detection","South Asia","respiratory viruses","North America","geographic trends","higher abundances of salivirus","high numbers of rotaviruses","high-throughput sequencing","certain city specific trends","quantification","useful supplement","aichivirus","central sampling","addition","treatment decisions","enterovirus B","globe","large areas","Islamabad","Reliable information","aim"],"language":"en"},

Tissue and faecal samples collected post mortem from cats diagnosed with or without FIP were subjected to RNA extraction and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect FCoV RNA. In cats with FIP, 95% of tissue, and 81% of faecal samples were PCR-positive, as opposed to 22% of tissue, and 60% of faecal samples in cats without FIP. Relative FCoV copy numbers were significantly higher in the cats with FIP, both in tissues (P \u003C 0.001) and faeces (P = 0.02). PCR-positive samples underwent pyrosequencing encompassing position 1058 of the FCoV spike protein. This identified a methionine codon at position 1058, consistent with the shedding of an enteric form of FCoV, in 77% of the faecal samples from cats with FIP, and in 100% of the samples from cats without FIP. In contrast, 91% of the tissue samples from cats with FIP and 89% from cats without FIP had a leucine codon at position 1058, consistent with a systemic form of FCoV.

Non-contact IR thermometers (NCITs) and IR thermographs (IRTs) have been used for fever screening in public areas such as airports. While NCITs remain a more popular choice than IRTs, there has been increasing evidences in the literature that IRTs can provide great accuracy in estimating body temperature if qualified systems are used and appropriate procedures are consistently applied. In this study, we addressed the issue of IRT qualification by implementing and evaluating a battery of test methods for objective, quantitative assessment of IRT performance based on a recent international standard (IEC 80601-2-59). We tested two commercial IRTs to evaluate their stability and drift, image uniformity, minimum resolvable temperature difference, and radiometric temperature laboratory accuracy. Based on these tests, we illustrated how experimental and data processing procedures could affect results, and suggested methods for clarifying and optimizing test methods. Overall, the insights into thermograph standardization and acquisition methods provided by this study may improve the utility of IR thermography and aid in comparing IRT performance, thus improving the potential for producing high quality disease pandemic countermeasures.","publish_time":"2018-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghassemi, Pejman; Pfefer, T.

Here we report an outbreak in a NICU detected during a screening trial for RSV infection using a rapid antigen test (Respi-Strip\u00AE). Eleven preterm infants in our NICU tested positive for RSV during January 2009. Subsequent testing of the remaining infants in the NICU revealed two additional asymptomatic cases. In addition to precautions against cross-infection, palivizumab prophylaxis was administered to the remaining 37 premature infants. Two days after treatment, RSV was detected in two additional infants who had become symptomatic.

Factors associated with the likelihood of contracting the disease (e.g., residing near the epicenter), extent of potential harm (e.g., being an elderly), and relational issues (e.g., those within a marriage) exacerbated the detrimental effect of the outbreak on emotional well-being. Further, individuals\u2019 perception of their knowledge about coronavirus infection was another factor. Regardless of the actual amount of knowledge they possessed, those perceiving themselves as more knowledgeable, were able to experience more happiness during the outbreak. Higher perceived knowledge was associated with a stronger sense of control, which mediated the differences in emotional well-being.

The importation of the cases owing to enormous international travels from the affected countries is the foremost reason for local cycle of transmission. For a country like India, the second most populous country in the world with ~ 1.35 billion population, the management and control of 2019-nCoV domestic spread heavily relied on effective screening and strict quarantine of passengers arriving at various international airports in India from affected countries. Here, by extracting the data from FLIRT, an online airline database for more than 800 airlines, and scanning more than 180,000 flights and 39.9 million corresponding passenger seats during 4th \u2013 25th March, we show that India experienced the highest risk index of importing the passengers from middle eastern airports. Contrary to perception, travelers from China imposed lowest risk of importing the infected cases in India. This is clearly evident form the fact that while the number of infected cases were on the peak in China India was one of the least affected countries. The number of cases in India started exhibiting a sharp increase in the infected cases only after the European countries and USA recorded large number of infected cases. We further argue that while the number of cases in middle eastern countries may still be very low, the airports in middle eastern countries, particularly Dubai, being one of the largest transit hubs for international passengers, including arriving in India, might have posed a higher risk of getting infected with 2019-nCoV. We suggest that any future travel related disease infection screening at the airports should critically assess the passengers from major transit hubs in addition to affected country of origin.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gunthe, Sachin S.; Patra, Satya S.","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b5a192d5d7cdf9a49b54cd499eda58e76327d8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7216130.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398137/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00575-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["China India","China","India"],"keyphrases":["affected countries","number of cases","China India","middle eastern countries","large number of infected cases","European countries","international passengers","middle eastern airports","affected country of origin","various international airports","strict quarantine of passengers","lowest risk","higher risk","populous country","arriving","enormous international travels","largest transit hubs","major transit hubs","highest risk index","nCoV domestic spread","effective screening","future travel related disease infection screening","addition","foremost reason","USA","control","travelers","online airline database","local cycle of transmission","sharp increase","FLIRT","perception","fact","Dubai","peak","outbreak of novel coronavirus","flights","corresponding passenger seats","population","world","management","deaths","evident form","recent pandemic","airlines","COVID","territories","importation","people"],"language":"en"},

The virome with the human-infection potential is far from complete. Novel viruses have been discovered at an unprecedented pace as the rapid development of viral metagenomics. However, there is still a lack of a method for rapidly identifying the virus with the human-infection potential. This study built several machine learning models for discriminating the human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences. The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model could predict the human-infecting virus with an accuracy of over 90%. Even for the KNN models built on the contigs as short as 1kb, they performed comparably to those built on the viral genomes, suggesting that the models could be used to identify the human-infecting virus from the viral metagenomic sequences.

Oligomerization of viroporin subunits results in formation of a hydrophilic pore which facilitates ion transport across host cell membranes. These viral channel proteins may be involved in different stages of the virus infection cycle. Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes best recognized for their ability to control activation of caspase-1, which in turn regulates the maturation of interleukin-1 \u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). IL-1\u03B2 was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce both local and systemic inflammation and a febrile reaction in response to infection or injury. Excessive production of IL-1\u03B2 is associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Microbial derivatives, bacterial pore-forming toxins, extracellular ATP and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Recent studies have reported that viroporin activity is capable of inducing inflammasome activity and production of IL-1\u03B2, where NLRP3 is shown to be regulated by fluxes of K\u002B, H\u002B and Ca2\u002B in addition to reactive oxygen species, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the key findings on viroporin activity with special emphasis on their role in virus immunity and as possible activators of inflammasomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farag, N.

With this in mind, the present article focuses on ways in which the use of \u2018nonmodel\u2019 rodents (not the familiar laboratory species) can advance studies into the classical, but ever relevant, epidemiologic triad of immune defence, infectious disease and environment. For example, naturally occurring rodents are an interesting system in which to study the environmental stimuli that drive the development and homeostasis of the immune system and, by extension, to identify where these stimuli are altered in anthropogenic environments leading to the formation of immunopathological phenotypes. Measurement of immune expression may help define individual heterogeneity in infectious disease susceptibility and transmission and facilitate our understanding of infection dynamics and risk in the natural environment; furthermore, it may provide a means of surveillance that can filter individuals carrying previously unknown acute infections of potential ecological or zoonotic importance. Finally, the study of immunology in wild animals may reveal interactions within the immune system and between immunity and other organismal traits that are not observable under restricted laboratory conditions. Potentiating much of this is the possibility of combining gene expression profiles with analytical tools derived from ecology and systems biology to reverse engineer interaction networks between immune responses, other organismal traits and the environment (including symbiont exposures), revealing regulatory architecture. Such holistic studies promise to link ecology, epidemiology and immunology in natural systems in a unified approach that can illuminate important problems relevant to human health and animal welfare and production.","publish_time":"2015-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackson, J.

Based on the modified Jennerian approach to immunization, we constructed and characterized a reassortant rotavirus stain, which bears a single bovine rotavirus VP7 gene encoding G genotype 6 specificity while the remaining 10 genes are derived from the ovine attenuated rotavirus LLR-85. The reassortant rotavirus strain, named as R191, and its parental virus strain LLR-85 were combined as bivalent vaccine candidates to inoculate the colostrums-deprived neonatal calves for evaluation of the immunogenicity. The calves were orally inoculated with the reassortant R191 (group 1), the parental rotavirus LLR-85 (group 2), or combined the R191 and LLR-85 (group 3), and serum specimens were detected to determine the immune response of IgG and IgA antibodies. Results showed that seroconversion to positivity for IgG and IgA antibodies occurred at postinoculation day (PID) 10 in all of the inoculated calves, and the highest titers of the serum IgG (range 1:800 to 1:6400) and IgA (range 1:800 to 1:3200) antibodies were obtained at PID 21 for all calves. Meanwhile, virus shedding was detected after inoculation, showing that the inoculated virus was positive in 2 of 77 fecal specimens (2.6%) collected from the inoculated calves during the first 7 days of oral inoculation with the rotavirus vaccine candidates.

Therefore guinea pig may be a useful animal model for better understanding influenza infection and assessing vaccine strategies. To more fully characterize the model, antibody responses following either infection/re-infection with human influenza A/Wyoming/03/2003 H3N2 or immunization with its homologous recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) protein were studied. RESULTS: Serological samples were collected and tested for anti-HA immunoglobulin by ELISA, antiviral antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and recognition of linear epitopes by peptide scanning (PepScan). Animals inoculated with infectious virus demonstrated pronounced viral replication and subsequent serological conversion. Animals either immunized with the homologous HA antigen or infected, showed a relatively rapid rise in antibody titers to the HA glycoprotein in ELISA assays. Antiviral antibodies, measured by HI assay, were detectable after the second inoculation. PepScan data identified both previously recognized and newly defined linear epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: Infection and/or recombinant HA immunization of guinea pigs with H3N2 Wyoming influenza virus resulted in a relatively rapid production of viral-specific antibody thus demonstrating the strong immunogenicity of the major viral structural proteins in this animal model for influenza infection. The sensitivity of the immune response supports the utility of the guinea pig as a useful animal model of influenza infection and immunization.","publish_time":"2010-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bushnell, Ruth V; Tobin, John K; Long, Jinxue; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey; Chaudhuri, A Ray; Nara, Peter L; Tobin, Gregory J","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b5d310d0656503b1d2fbc612625496a3266ae16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2939558.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20735849/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["useful animal model of influenza infection","better understanding influenza infection","re-infection","recombinant HA immunization of guinea pigs","H3N2 Wyoming influenza virus","HA glycoprotein","human influenza viruses","homologous HA antigen","anti-HA immunoglobulin","rapid production of viral","specific antibody","antiviral antibodies","antibody titers","antibody responses","Animals","pronounced viral replication","homologous recombinant hemagglutinin","recognition of linear epitopes","defined linear epitopes","major viral structural proteins","infectious virus","rapid rise","HI assay","ELISA assays","Serological samples","PepScan data","subsequent serological conversion","strong immunogenicity","hemagglutination inhibition","previous studies","peptide scanning","vaccine strategies","utility","immune response","BACKGROUND","sensitivity","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","inoculation"],"language":"en"},

Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital. Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women. On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria. The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1\u002B (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2\u002B\u223C3\u002B (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1\u002B (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2\u002B\u223C3\u002B (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count. Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality. Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Yichun; Luo, Ran; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Meng; Wang, Zhixiang; Dong, Lei; Li, Junhua; Yao, Ying; Ge, Shuwang; Xu, Gang","journal":"Kidney International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f3489e0cfb08b40188631c9a0dfd20e2fa43633.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110296.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820302556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32247631/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253820302556","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["AKI"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["patients","prevalence of kidney disease","awareness of kidney disease","disease outbreak","severe COVID","hospital death","disease severity","AKI stage","prevalence of acute kidney injury","hospital mortality","prevalence of elevated serum creatinine","elevated baseline serum creatinine","elevated blood urea nitrogen","development of AKI","elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen","tertiary teaching hospital","markers of abnormal kidney function","Wuhan","admission","proteinuria","hematuria","hazard ratio","higher risk","major outbreak","Median age","study period","acute respiratory failure","independent risk factors","prospective cohort study","Cox proportional hazard regression","main features","diffuse alveolar damage","comorbidity","affiliates","sex","Hubei Province","glomerular filtration","leukocyte count","association","years","Kaplan-Meier analysis","hospitalization","involvement","China","confidence interval","interquartile range","findings","information","organs","clinicians","women","coronavirus","areas","73m2"],"language":"en"},

How IECs regulate their innate immune response to maintain gut homeostasis remains unclear. Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines produced during infections. While type I IFN receptors are ubiquitously expressed, type III IFN receptors are expressed only on epithelial cells. This epithelium specificity strongly suggests exclusive functions at epithelial surfaces, but the relative roles of type I and III IFNs in the establishment of an antiviral innate immune response in human IECs are not clearly defined. Here, we used mini-gut organoids to define the functions of types I and III IFNs to protect the human gut against viral infection. We show that primary non-transformed human IECs, upon viral challenge, upregulate the expression of both type I and type III IFNs at the transcriptional level but only secrete type III IFN in the supernatant. However, human IECs respond to both type I and type III IFNs by producing IFN-stimulated genes that in turn induce an antiviral state. Using genetic ablation of either type I or type III IFN receptors, we show that either IFN can independently restrict virus infection in human IECs. Importantly, we report, for the first time, differences in the mechanisms by which each IFN establishes the antiviral state. Contrary to type I IFN, the antiviral activity induced by type III IFN is strongly dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathway, suggesting a pathway used by type III IFNs that non-redundantly contributes to the antiviral state. In conclusion, we demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells specifically regulate their innate immune response favoring type III IFN-mediated signaling, which allows for efficient protection against pathogens without producing excessive inflammation. Our results strongly suggest that type III IFN constitutes the frontline of antiviral response in the human gut. We propose that mucosal surfaces, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, have evolved to favor type III IFN-mediated response to pathogen infections as it allows for spatial segregation of signaling and moderate production of inflammatory signals which we propose are key to maintain gut homeostasis.","publish_time":"2017-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pervolaraki, Kalliopi; Stanifer, Megan L.; M\u00FCnchau, Stephanie; Renn, Lynnsey A.; Albrecht, Dorothee; Kurzhals, Stefan; Sen\u00EDs, Elena; Grimm, Dirk; Schr\u00F6der-Braunstein, Jutta; Rabin, Ronald L.; Boulant, Steeve","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5080088701ed43effa979603627b2a3ad53d5aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5399069.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28484457/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00459","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III","III IFN"],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["favor type","IFN receptors","IFN-mediated response","human gut","IFNs","relative roles of type","IFN-stimulated genes","antiviral state","antiviral innate immune response","frontline of antiviral response","human intestinal epithelial cells","antiviral activity","gut homeostasis","primary non-transformed human IECs","epithelial surfaces","mini-gut organoids","pathway","pathogen infections","viral infection","exclusive functions","viral challenge","functions of types","mucosal surfaces","pathogen challenges","virus infection","mitogen-activated protein kinases","turn","establishment","moderate production of inflammatory signals","spatial segregation","gastrointestinal tract","transcriptional level","pathogens","efficient protection","excessive inflammation","epithelium specificity","commensal flora","mechanisms","cytokines","expression","time","differences","Interferons","conclusion","supernatant","results","genetic ablation"],"language":"en"},

Recently, rapid classification of virus species, analysis of genome and screening for effective drugs are the most important tasks. In the present study, through literature review, sequence alignment, ORF identification, motif recognition, secondary and tertiary structure prediction, the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 were comprehensively analyzed. To find effective drugs, the parameters of binding sites were calculated by SeeSAR. In addition, potential miRNAs were predicted according to RNA base-pairing. After prediction by using NCBI, WebMGA and GeneMark and comparison, a total of 8 credible ORFs were detected. Even the whole genome have great difference with other CoVs, each ORF has high homology with SARS-CoVs (\u003E90%). Furthermore, domain composition in each ORFs was also similar to SARS. In the DrugBank database, only 7 potential drugs were screened based on the sequence search module. Further predicted binding sites between drug and ORFs revealed that 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid could bind 1# ORF in 4 different regions ideally. Meanwhile, both benzyl (2-oxopropyl) carbamate and 4-(dimehylamina) benzoic acid have bene demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV infection effectively. Interestingly, 2 miRNAs (miR-1307-3p and miR-3613-5p) were predicted to prevent virus replication via targeting 3\u2032-UTR of the genome or as biomarkers. In conclusion, the novel coronavirus may have consanguinity with SARS. Drugs used to treat SARS may also be effective against the novel virus.

Cattle and especially calves have been identified as one of the most common reservoirs of this protist. However, little is known about the genetics of Cryptosporidium in calves in some regions of France. The aim of this study was to detect and isolate Cryptosporidium spp. in faecal samples from naturally infected pre-weaned calves (\u226445 days-old) in France. A total of 35 diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf faecal samples were collected from 26 dairy cattle farms in six departments (French administrative provinces). Cryptosporidium presence was established by microscopically screening samples for oocystes with an immunofluorescent (DFA) staining method. DFA-positive samples were then analysed by PCR-RFLP and 18S rRNA gene sequencing to determine species. Cryptosporidium parvum-positive samples were subtyped via nested PCR analysis of a partial fragment of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene product. Data were then integrated into phylogenetic tree analysis. DFA revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in 31 out of 35 (88%) samples. Combined with 18S rRNA gene analysis results, C. parvum was detected in 30 samples. Subtyping analysis in 27/30 samples (90%) of the C. parvum isolates revealed two zoonotic subtype families, IIa (24/27) and IId (3/27). Four subtypes were recognised within the subtype family IIa, including the hypertransmissible IIaA15G2R1 subtype that is the most frequently reported worldwide (21/27), IIaA17G3R1 (1/27), IIaA17G1R1 (1/27), and IIaA19G1R1 (1/27). Two subtypes were recognised within the IId subtype family including IIdA22G1 (2/27) and IIdA27G1 (1/27). These findings illustrate the high occurrence of Cryptosporidium in calves in dairy herds and increase the diversity of molecularly characterised C. parvum isolates with the first description of IIaA17G3R1, IIaA19G1R1, and IId subtypes in France. The presence of zoonotic C. parvum subtype families (IIa, IId) in this study suggests that pre-weaned calves are likely to be a significant reservoir of zoonotic C. parvum, and highlights the importance of animal to human cryptosporidiosis transmission risk. Further molecular studies in calves and small ruminants from other French regions are required to better understand the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in France.","publish_time":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mammeri, Mohamed; Chevillot, Aur\u00E9lie; Chenafi, Ilham; Thomas, Myriam; Julien, Christine; Vall\u00E9e, Isabelle; Polack, Bruno; Follet, J\u00E9r\u00F4me; Adjou, Karim Tarik","journal":"Vet Parasitol Reg Stud Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42ed4c4f257b2c9776eacccb1fc093132df5f94a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103931.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405939019300681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31796198/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405939019300681; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100323","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DFA"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["Cryptosporidium parvum-positive samples","Cryptosporidium presence","screening samples","parvum subtype families","DFA-positive samples","parvum isolates","isolate Cryptosporidium","genetics of Cryptosporidium","zoonotic subtype families","IId subtype family","presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts","presence of zoonotic","IId subtypes","subtype family IIa","infected pre-weaned calves","diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf faecal samples","high occurrence of Cryptosporidium","regions of France","Subtyping analysis","S rRNA gene analysis results","nested PCR analysis","hypertransmissible IIaA15G2R1 subtype","significant reservoir of zoonotic","S rRNA gene sequencing","gene product","study","French regions","species","phylogenetic tree analysis","IIaA19G1R1","dairy cattle farms","PCR-RFLP","dairy herds","description of IIaA17G3R1","epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis","significant intestinal disease","French administrative provinces","obligate intracellular protist parasite","human cryptosporidiosis transmission risk","wide range of vertebrate hosts","kDa glycoprotein","departments","partial fragment","small ruminants","animals","importance of animal","humans","diversity","gp60","molecular studies","total","oocystes","IIdA22G1","days-old","staining method","findings","Data","common reservoirs","IIaA17G1R1","IIdA27G1","aim"],"language":"en"},

To deliver the enzymatic \u2018A\u2019 subunits of the toxin to the site of action in host cells, the receptor-binding \u2018B\u2019 subunit PltB binds to the trisaccharide glycan receptor moieties terminated in N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) that is \u03B12\u20133 or \u03B12\u20136 linked to the underlying disaccharide, galactose (Gal) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Neu5Ac is present in both unmodified and modified forms, with 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac being the most common modification in humans. Here we show that host cells associated with typhoid toxin-mediated clinical signs express both unmodified and 9-O-acetylated glycan receptor moieties. We found that PltB binds to 9-O-acetylated \u03B12\u20133 glycan receptor moieties with a markedly increased affinity, while the binding affinity to 9-O-acetylated \u03B12\u20136 glycans is only slightly higher, as compared to the affinities of PltB to the unmodified counterparts, respectively. We also present X-ray co-crystal structures of PltB bound to related glycan moieties, which supports the different effects of 9-O-acetylated \u03B12\u20133 and \u03B12\u20136 glycan receptor moieties on the toxin binding. Lastly, we demonstrate that the cells exclusively expressing unmodified glycan receptor moieties are less susceptible to typhoid toxin than the cells expressing 9-O-acetylated counterparts, although typhoid toxin intoxicates both cells. These results reveal a fine-tuning mechanism of a bacterial toxin that exploits specific chemical modifications of its glycan receptor moieties for virulence and provide useful insights into the development of therapeutics against typhoid fever.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Tri; Lee, Sohyoung; Yang, Yi-An; Ahn, Changhwan; Sim, Ji Hyun; Kei, Tiffany G.; Barnard, Karen N.; Yu, Hai; Millano, Shawn K.; Chen, Xi; Parrish, Colin R.; Song, Jeongmin","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4c63d458b2753ffdbce2e8835da809de2a8c7f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7055914.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32084237/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008336","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Typhoid toxin","O-acetylated glycan receptor moieties","unmodified glycan receptor moieties","O-acetylated \u03B12","trisaccharide glycan receptor moieties","toxin binding","related glycan moieties","receptor-binding","O-acetylated Neu5Ac","O-acetylated counterparts","bacterial toxin","host cells","typhoid fever","unmodified counterparts","typhoid disease progression","subunit PltB","binding affinity","affinities of PltB","Salmonella Typhi-infected cells","present X-ray co-crystal structures of PltB","increased affinity","N-acetylglucosamine","human infection","N-acetylneuraminic acid","establishment of chronic infection","specific chemical modifications","useful insights","development of therapeutics","site of action","virulence","galactose","fine-tuning mechanism","common modification","modified forms","clinical signs","glycans","different effects","underlying disaccharide","subunits","results","humans","GlcNAc"],"language":"en"},

Limited availability of human pathologic specimens during early RSV-induced lung disease and ethical restrictions for RSV challenge studies in the lower airways of human volunteers has slowed our understanding of how RSV causes airway disease and greatly limited the development of therapeutic strategies for reducing RSV disease burden. Our current knowledge of RSV infection and pathology is largely based on in vitro studies using nonpolarized epithelial cell-lines grown on plastic or in vivo studies using animal models semipermissive for RSV infection. Although these models have revealed important aspects of RSV infection, replication, and associated inflammatory responses, these models do not broadly recapitulate the early interactions and potential consequences of RSV infection of the human columnar airway epithelium in vivo. In this chapter, the pro et contra of in vitro models of human columnar airway epithelium and their usefulness in respiratory virus pathogenesis and vaccine development studies will be discussed. The use of such culture models to predict characteristics of RSV infection and the correlation of these findings to the human in vivo situation will likely accelerate our understanding of RSV pathogenesis potentially identifying novel strategies for limiting the severity of RSV-associated airway disease.","publish_time":"2013-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pickles, Raymond J.","journal":"Challenges and Opportunities for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa4a60b6d6dfba4999e3c30940e3490bfce8f2b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122615.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38919-1_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24362700/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of RSV","characteristics of RSV infection","RSV challenge studies","RSV disease burden","understanding of RSV pathogenesis","important aspects of RSV infection","potential consequences of RSV infection","current knowledge of RSV infection","early RSV-induced lung disease","models of human columnar airway epithelium","associated airway disease","important human respiratory pathogen","culture models","vaccine development studies","respiratory virus pathogenesis","animal models semipermissive","lower airways of human volunteers","Limited availability of human pathologic specimens","Respiratory syncytial virus","development of therapeutic strategies","early interactions","novel strategies","usefulness","ethical restrictions","plastic","replication","narrow species tropism","nonpolarized epithelial cell-lines","pro et contra of","pathology","correlation","findings","inflammatory responses","chapter","situation"],"language":"en"},

Also, samples were collected from quail (N = 4), Bluebird (Sialis, N = 1), and Greenfinch (Chloris chloris, N = 1) for analysis. Respiratory viral pathogens were screened by PCR and positive samples were subjected to virus isolation and genetic identification. Antigenic relatedness of isolated avian influenza (AI) H5 subtype was evaluated using cross-hemagglutination inhibition. Results revealed that the incidence of single virus infections in commercial broilers was 64.1% (25/39), with the highest incidence for ND (33.3%) and H9N2 (20.5%), followed by H5N1 (7.7%) and H5N8 (2.7). Meanwhile, H9N2/ND mixed infection was the most observed case (7.7%). Other mixed infections H5N1/ND, H5N1/H9N2/ND, H5N1/H9N2/ND/IB, H9N2/IB, and H9N2/ILT were also observed (2.6% each). In commercial layers, H5N1 and ILT were the only detected single infections (18.1% each). Mixed H9N2/ND was the most predominant infection in layers (27.3%). Other mixed infections of H9N2/IB, H5N1/H5N8/H9N2, and H9N2/ND/IB were observed in 3 separate farms (9.1% each). The H5N8 virus was detected in one quail farm and 2 out of 3 wild bird\u0027s samples. Partial HA gene sequence analysis showed the clustering of the selected AI H5N8 within the 2.3.4.4 clade, while H5N1 clustered with the clade 2.2.1.2. Interestingly, the H5N8 isolated from chickens possessed 6 amino acids substitutions at HA1 compared to those isolated from wild birds with low antigenic relatedness to AI H5N1 clades 2.2.1 or 2.2.1.2. In conclusion, mixed viral infections were observed in both broiler and layer chickens in Egypt. The detected triple H5N1, H9N2, and H5N8 influenza co-infection raises the concern of potential AI epidemic strain emergence. The low genetic and antigenic relatedness between AI H5N1 and H5N8 viruses suggest the need for modification of vaccination strategies of avian influenza in Egypt along with strict biosecurity measures.","publish_time":"2019-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shehata, Awad A; Sedeik, Mahmoud E; Elbestawy, Ahmed R; Zain El-Abideen, Mohamed A; Ibrahim, Hytham H; Kilany, Walid H; Ali, Ahmed","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6a825d4a6b144e3b175e96560a2e4182b2d4123.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107238.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668795/; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Antigenic"],"organizations":["ND","ILT","Partial HA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mixed H9N2","mixed infections of H9N2","mixed infections H5N1","AI H5N1 clades","ND mixed infection","detected triple H5N1","selected AI H5N8","H5N8 viruses","mixed viral infections","H5N8 influenza co-infection","single infections","commercial layers","incidence of single virus infections","Antigenic relatedness of isolated avian influenza","low antigenic relatedness","observed case","poultry farms of commercial broilers","Egypt","predominant infection","virus isolation","ILT","positive samples","wild bird\u0027s samples","Chloris chloris","concern of potential AI epidemic strain emergence","Respiratory viral pathogens","modification of vaccination strategies of avian influenza","wild birds","genetic identification","respiratory problems","layer chickens","separate farms","highest incidence","quail farm","Partial HA gene sequence analysis","clustering","H5 subtype","need","HA1","PCR","amino acids substitutions","strict biosecurity measures","Greenfinch","cross-hemagglutination inhibition","mortality","period","total","Bluebird","conclusion","Results","Sialis"],"language":"en"},

It is important to raise awareness of infection control practices in resource-limited settings, since overdependence upon antimicrobial agents and co-existing lack of awareness of infection control is encouraging the emergence of multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. We reviewed 125 articles regarding HAIs from both advanced and resource-limited neonatal units in order to study risk factors, aetiological agents, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and reported successes in infection control interventions. The articles include surveillance studies, outbreaks and sporadic incidents. Gram-positive cocci, viruses and fungi predominate in reports from the advanced units, while Gram-negative enteric rods, non-fermenters and fungi are commonly reported from resource-limited settings. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from surveillance studies determined the empirical therapy used in each neonatal unit. Most outbreaks, irrespective of the technical facilities available, were traced to specific lack of infection control practices. We discuss infection control interventions, with special emphasis on their applicability in resource-limited settings.

The piglets were inoculated intratracheally with 107.5 50% egg infective dose [EID50] Swine/Belgium/1/98 (H1N1) SIV and were euthanased at time-points between 0 and 120h post-inoculation (PI). Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung homogenates and sera were examined for inflammatory mediators by bioassay or ELISA. Interferon (IFN)-\u03B1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 peaked in BALF 24\u201330h PI, when virus titres and the severity of clinical signs were maximal. Whereas IFN-\u03B3 and IL-12, but not IL-18, increased in tandem in BALF, serum cytokine concentrations were either undetectable or were up to 100-fold lower. The APP C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin peaked 24h later than the cytokines and reached higher levels in serum than in BALF. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) only increased in BALF. Lung virus titres tightly correlated with BALF IFN-\u03B1, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B3 and IL-12, as well as with serum IL-6, IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B3. Signs of disease correlated with the same cytokines in BALF and serum, as well as with BALF LBP and serum CRP. The findings suggest that IFN-\u03B3 and IL-12 play a role in the pathogenesis of SIV and that APPs are induced by cytokines. This influenza infection model may have value in assessing the therapeutic potential of cytokine antagonists.","publish_time":"2011-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barb\u00E9, Filip; Atanasova, Kalina; Van Reeth, Kristien","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9c2c2d109095422b4d4a85d46b181e65bcf4d54.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129392.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20097110/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023309004882; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2009.12.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023309004882","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV","BALF","BALF LBP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum IL","BALF IFN-\u03B1","IFN-\u03B3","BALF LBP","cytokines","TNF-\u03B1","serum CRP","serum cytokine concentrations","h PI","Lung virus titres","induced swine influenza virus","APPs","pathogenesis of SIV","influenza infection model","h post-inoculation","binding protein","acute stages","lung homogenates","Signs of disease","acute phase proteins","severity of clinical signs","caesarean-derived piglets","APP C-reactive protein","therapeutic potential of cytokine antagonists","EID50","LPS","value","Belgium","sera","tandem","Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid","inflammatory mediators","tumour necrosis factor","egg infective dose","lipopolysaccharide","colostrum","week-old","haptoglobin","higher levels","bioassay","ELISA","H1N1","role","interleukin","time-points","contrast","findings","Interferon","study"],"language":"en"},

Infections that are not cleared by the host are characterized as persistent. The agent in nonreplicating or latent infection may begin to grow again or to reactivate. Growth of a microorganism such as normal bacterial flora on a normally nonsterile body surface such as the colonic mucosa in the absence of disease is called colonization. Some infectious agents known as pathogens routinely cause disease; others known as opportunistic cause disease only in persons with altered host defenses, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The location where a pathogen normally resides is the reservoir, such as naturally infected animals. The mechanism by which the pathogen moves from the reservoir into the patient is known as transmission such as by drinking contaminated water. The portals of entry are mucosal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cutaneous. A pathogen may replicate at the portal of entry and cause disease by secreting a toxin or enter the body and spread via the lymphatic or blood vessels, nerves, urinary tract, respiratory tract, cerebrospinal fluid, over mesothelial surfaces, or to the fetus transplacentally. Many infectious agents target a particular organ where they replicate and cause damage, for example, hepatitis, myocarditis, and meningoencephalitis.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker, D.

We have paid particular attention to respiratory viruses that wreak heavy morbidity and mortality worldwide. The clinically significant ones include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) (two Paramyxoviruses), and influenza virus (an Orthomyxovirus). As the infection by these viruses is clinically restricted to the respiratory tissues, mainly the lungs, the logical route for the application of the siRNA was also the same, i.e., via the nasal route. Following the initial success of single intranasal siRNA against RSV, we now offer two new strategies: (1) second-generation siRNAs, used against the paramyxoviral RNA polymerase large subunit (L), (2) siRNA cocktail with a novel transfection reagent, used against influenza virus. Based on these results, we propose the following consensus for designing intranasal antiviral siRNAs: (a) modified 19\u201327 nt-long double-stranded siRNAs are functional in the lung, (b) excessive 2\u2032-OMe and 2\u2032-F modifications in either or both strands of these siRNAs reduce efficacy, (c) limited modifications in the sense strand are beneficial, although their precise efficacy may be position-dependent, (d) cocktail of multiple siRNAs can be highly effective against multiple viral strains and subtypes.","publish_time":"2014-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barik, Sailen; Lu, Patrick","journal":"RNA Interference","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea0c0191814b127d48c4c0c09277386909ec2e42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122875.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-1538-5_14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25319655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["second-generation siRNAs","cocktail of multiple siRNAs","siRNA cocktail","respiratory syncytial virus","intranasal antiviral siRNAs","parainfluenza virus","respiratory viruses","RSV","application of RNA interference","respiratory tissues","nt-long double-stranded siRNAs","initial success of single intranasal siRNA","multiple viral strains","limited modifications","synthesized short interfering RNA","F modifications","precise efficacy","new era","viral genes","following consensus","new strategies","logical route","nasal route","paramyxoviral RNA polymerase large subunit","novel transfection reagent","sense strand","RNAi","heavy morbidity","significant ones","OMe","subtypes","lungs","PIV","strands","Paramyxoviruses","particular attention","mortality","results","Orthomyxovirus","infection"],"language":"en"},

There is now compelling evidence that enveloped virions released from infected cells carry numerous host (cellular) proteins some of which may play an important role in viral replication. Although several cellular proteins have been previously shown to be incorporated into VSV virions, no systematic study has been done to reveal the host protein composition for virions of VSV or any other member of Mononegavirales. RESULTS: Here we used a proteomics approach to identify cellular proteins within purified VSV virions, thereby creating a \u0022snapshot\u0022 of one stage of virus/host interaction that can guide future experiments aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms of virus-cell interactions. Highly purified preparations of VSV virions from three different cell lines of human, mouse and hamster origin were analyzed for the presence of cellular proteins using mass spectrometry. We have successfully confirmed the presence of several previously-identified cellular proteins within VSV virions and identified a number of additional proteins likely to also be present within the virions. In total, sixty-four cellular proteins were identified, of which nine were found in multiple preparations. A combination of immunoblotting and proteinase K protection assay was used to verify the presence of several of these proteins (integrin \u03B21, heat shock protein 90 kDa, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein, annexin 2, elongation factor 1a) within the virions. CONCLUSION: This is, to our knowledge, the first systematic study of the host protein composition for virions of VSV or any other member of the order Mononegavirales. Future experiments are needed to determine which of the identified proteins have an interaction with VSV and whether these interactions are beneficial, neutral or antiviral with respect to VSV replication. Identification of host proteins-virus interactions beneficial for virus would be particularly exciting as they can provide new ways to combat viral infections via control of host components.","publish_time":"2009-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moerdyk-Schauwecker, Megan; Hwang, Sun-Il; Grdzelishvili, Valery Z","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8710043513b5790e20921e8a36d1cc94b402701.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2770056.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19821998/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virions of VSV","identified proteins","purified VSV virions","presence of cellular proteins","VSV replication","purified preparations of VSV virions","enveloped virions","Identification of host proteins-virus interactions beneficial","host protein composition","host interaction","numerous host","number of additional proteins likely","kDa protein","stage of virus","member of Mononegavirales","heat shock protein","control of host components","cell interactions","order Mononegavirales","molecular mechanisms of virus","Vesicular stomatitis virus","systematic study","viral replication","future experiments","heat shock cognate","best studied member","viral infections","multiple preparations","different cell lines of human","infected cells","mouse","annexin","antiviral","prototypic rhabdovirus","integrin \u03B21","respect","new ways","hamster origin","proteinase","protection assay","elongation factor","BACKGROUND","proteomics approach","mass spectrometry","combination of immunoblotting","compelling evidence","important role","snapshot","knowledge","total","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Such a clarification would greatly facilitate the work of policymakers seeking to ensure security while avoiding undesirable interventions of government in the conduct of science. The article starts with an overview of the main developments in life sciences in relation to dual use. This is illustrated by discussions on synthetic biology and dual use. The findings lead to a reconsideration of the dual use concept. An area in need of further attention is to what extent threats and intentions should have impact on the definition of dual use. Possible threats are analyzed against the background of the phenomenon of securitization of health care and life sciences: considering these sectors of society in security terms. Some caveats that should be taken into account in a dual use policy are described. An acceptable, adequate and applicable definition of the dual use concept could help researchers, universities, companies and policy makers. Such a definition should build upon, but go beyond, the view developed in the influential Fink-report, which concentrates on the so-called \u2018experiments of concern\u2019, e.g. experiments that enhance the virulence of pathogens (National Research Council of the National Academies 2004) It will be argued that\u2014in addition to these more technical aspects\u2014a definition of dual use should include the aspect of threats and intentions.","publish_time":"2011-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Bruggen, Koos","journal":"Sci Eng Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f3401216256123b750a1d70058fea8af14ec311.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3513596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21327859/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-011-9266-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Research Council","National Academies"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["concept of dual use","dual use concept","definition of dual use","dual use policy","life sciences","applicable definition","extent threats","aspect of threats","intentions","Possible threats","clarification","article","National Academies","security terms","experiments of concern","policy makers","National Research Council","universities","researchers","relation","impact","scope of application","phenomenon of securitization","virulence of pathogens","health care","main developments","sectors of society","undesirable interventions of government","technical aspects","companies","attention","background","overview","weeks","discussions","synthetic biology","account","reconsideration","anthrax letters","influential Fink-report","conduct of science","past decade","terrorist attacks","work of policymakers","area","need","addition","caveats","findings"],"language":"en"},

Acute febrile illness associated with petechiae, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple-organ failure are the main symptoms of the disease. With all these fatal effects, CCHFV is considered a huge threat as no successful therapeutic approach is currently available for the treatment of this disease. In the present study, we have used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of CCHFV. Both the T-cell and B-cell epitopes were assessed, and the epitope \u201CDCSSTPPDR\u201D was found to be the most potential one, with 100% conservancy among all the strains of CCHFV. The epitope was also found to interact with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered nonallergenic as well. In vivo study of our proposed peptide is advised for novel universal vaccine production, which might be an effective path to prevent CCHF disease.","publish_time":"2015-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oany, Arafat Rahman; Ahmad, Shah Adil Ishtiyaq; Hossain, Mohammad Uzzal; Jyoti, Tahmina Pervin","journal":"Adv Appl Bioinform Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf87996bb6c0dbed5de9512ac2bab800417a8956.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4293217.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25609983/; https://doi.org/10.2147/aabc.s75250","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCHF"],"locations":["Asia","Europe","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CCHF disease","strains of CCHFV","disease fatality rate","tick-borne zoonotic viral disease","potential epitope-based vaccine","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","immunoinformatics approach","T-cell","present study","successful therapeutic approach","B-cell epitopes","novel universal vaccine production","eastern Europe","huge threat","multiple-organ failure","petechiae","intravascular coagulation","virus","Africa","proposed peptide","main symptoms","Congo hemorrhagic fever","Asia","Crimean","major histocompatibility complex molecules","effective path","Acute febrile illness","wide range of distribution","nonallergenic","Middle East","conservancy","treatment","fatal effects","DCSSTPPDR"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to pair network analysis and epidemiological data in order to evaluate the impact of animal movements on pathogen prevalence in farms and assess the risk of local areas being exposed to diseases due to incoming movements. Our methodology was applied to hepatitis E virus (HEV), an emerging foodborne zoonotic agent of concern that is highly prevalent in pig farms. Firstly, the pig movement network in France (data recorded in 2013) and the results of a nation-wide seroprevalence study (data collected in 178 farms in 2009) were modelled and analysed. The link between network centrality measures of farms and HEV seroprevalence levels was explored using a generalised linear model. The in-degree and ingoing closeness of farms were found to be statistically associated with high HEV within-farm seroprevalence (p\u003C0.05). Secondly, the risk of a French d\u00E9partement (i.e. French local administrative areas) being exposed to HEV was calculated by combining the distribution of farm-level HEV prevalence in source d\u00E9partements with the number of movements coming from those same d\u00E9partements. By doing so, the risk of exposure for d\u00E9partements was mapped, highlighting differences between geographical patterns of HEV prevalence and the risk of exposure to HEV. These results suggest that not only highly prevalent areas but also those having at-risk movements from infected areas should be monitored. Pathogen management and surveillance options in the pig production sector should therefore take animal movements into consideration, paving the way for the development of targeted and risk-based disease surveillance strategies.","publish_time":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salines, Morgane; Andraud, Mathieu; Rose, Nicolas","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc0a05c990db51533968300c39609e1e90987e96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126927.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587717305937; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.11.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587717305937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290293/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pig farms","high HEV","level HEV prevalence","HEV seroprevalence levels","risk of local areas","at-risk movements","number of movements","incoming movements","risk of exposure","impact of animal movements","Abstract Animal movements","pathogen prevalence","geographical patterns of HEV prevalence","prevalent areas","network centrality measures of farms","pig movement network","pig production sector","ingoing closeness of farms","farm seroprevalence","infected areas","French local administrative areas","epidemiological data","risk-based disease surveillance strategies","Pathogen management","nation-wide seroprevalence study","source d\u00E9partements","results","pair network analysis","major route of pathogen","surveillance options","French d\u00E9partement","distribution of farm","order","emerging foodborne zoonotic agent of concern","development of targeted","differences","hepatitis E virus","way","link","France","diseases","methodology","generalised linear model","degree","consideration"],"language":"en"},

Although a subject of controversy and a considerable scientific literature, we think that a solid understanding of ME/CFS pathogenesis is emerging. In this study, we compiled recent findings and placed them in the context of the clinical picture and natural history of the disease. A pattern emerged, giving rise to an explanatory model. ME/CFS often starts after or during an infection. A logical explanation is that the infection initiates an autoreactive process, which affects several functions, including brain and energy metabolism. According to our model for ME/CFS pathogenesis, patients with a genetic predisposition and dysbiosis experience a gradual development of B cell clones prone to autoreactivity. Under normal circumstances these B cell offsprings would have led to tolerance. Subsequent exogenous microbial exposition (triggering) can lead to comorbidities such as fibromyalgia, thyroid disorder, and orthostatic hypotension. A decisive infectious trigger may then lead to immunization against autoantigens involved in aerobic energy production and/or hormone receptors and ion channel proteins, producing postexertional malaise and ME/CFS, affecting both muscle and brain. In principle, cloning and sequencing of immunoglobulin variable domains could reveal the evolution of pathogenic clones. Although evidence consistent with the model accumulated in recent years, there are several missing links in it. Hopefully, the hypothesis generates testable propositions that can augment the understanding of the pathogenesis of ME/CFS.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blomberg, Jonas; Gottfries, Carl-Gerhard; Elfaitouri, Amal; Rizwan, Muhammad; Ros\u00E9n, Anders","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ed7ba58402344abc5e614e344d03a30c03164af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5818468.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29497420/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00229","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CFS pathogenesis","explanatory model","brain","infection","B cell offsprings","gradual development of B cell clones prone","energy metabolism","recent years","solid understanding","recent findings","aerobic energy production","evolution of pathogenic clones","disease of unknown origin","hormone receptors","ion channel proteins","dysbiosis","genetic predisposition","thyroid disorder","triggering","immunization","functions","postexertional malaise","debilitating","patients","sequencing of immunoglobulin variable domains","clinical picture","natural history","considerable scientific literature","Subsequent exogenous microbial exposition","context","fibromyalgia","comorbidities","autoantigens","normal circumstances","autoreactivity","subject of controversy","orthostatic hypotension","testable propositions","autoreactive process","rise","chronic fatigue syndrome","decisive infectious trigger","missing links","evidence consistent","hypothesis","principle","logical explanation","study","tolerance","muscle","Myalgic encephalomyelitis","pattern"],"language":"en"},

This article reviews the clinical and pathological data available on MERS and compares it to SARS. Most importantly, chest radiographs and imaging results of patients with MERS show features that resemble the findings of organizing pneumonia, different from the lesions in SARS patients, which show fibrocellular intra\u2010alveolar organization with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia\u2010like pattern. These findings are in line with differences in the induction of cytopathological changes, induction of host gene responses and sensitivity to the antiviral effect of interferons in vitro when comparing both MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV.

Abstract The Coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Importance on January 30, 2020 by the World Health Organization, has in many countries exceeded the capacity of health systems to respond, due to its high contagiousness and the capacity to manage the deceased, due to its high fatality risk. A review is necessary of the principal guidelines and protocols promoted by the institutions and the main scientific societies, aimed at containing the pandemic by adopting professional protection measures and appropriately managing the high number of cadavers. The temporary mortuaries in an epidemic crisis and the classification of bodies according to infectious risk are analysed. In particular the resolutions issued by the health authorities are summarised and the protocols for dealing with deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic are described, including forensic autopsies.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonz\u00E1lez-Fern\u00E1ndez, Jorge; Ib\u00E1\u00F1ez-Bern\u00E1ldez, Mar\u00EDa; Amador Mart\u00EDnez-Tejedor, Jos\u00E9; Alama-Carrizo, Sergio; S\u00E1nchez-Ugena, F\u00E9lix","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b104b1e8fed676ac0401e2a1c1efb0ced8b3329e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377473220300201?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377473220300201","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Organizaci\u00F3n Mundial de la Salud"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["The temporary","Abstract The Coronavirus","manage the deceased","In particular the resolutions issued by the health","necessary of the principal","and protocols promoted by the institutions and the main scientific","by the World Health Organization","its high contagiousness and the capacity","exceeded the capacity of health systems","summarised and the protocols for dealing with deaths during the COVID","in an epidemic crisis and the classification of","and appropriately managing the high number of cadavers","aimed at containing the pandemic by adopting professional protection","pandemia COVID","due","in many","its high fatality risk","recogida de cad\u00E1veres","declared a Public Health Emergency of International Importance on January","alto n\u00FAmero de cad\u00E1veres","infectious risk","adecuada gesti\u00F3n","protocolos promovidos","principales gu\u00EDas","riesgo infecto","protocolos de actuaci\u00F3n","principales sociedades cient\u00EDficas","elevado riesgo de letalidad","declarado Emergencia de Salud P\u00FAblica","respond","according","outbreak","instituciones","capacidad de respuesta","sistema sanitario","contenci\u00F3n","situaci\u00F3n de epidemias","funci\u00F3n","described","numerosos pa\u00EDses","alta contagiosidad","Importancia Internacional","personas fallecidas","autoridades sanitarias","adopci\u00F3n de medidas","profesionales","clasificaciones","fallecidos","review","centros especiales","resoluciones dictadas","protecci\u00F3n","including forensic","analysed","Organizaci\u00F3n Mundial","brote","autopsias forenses"],"language":"es"},

For example, the successes of French and Japanese exporters in international markets are in part determined by the levels of corruption in target countries. Alternatively, corruption in target countries does not appear to affect the successes of American exporters in global markets. The conceptualization of corruption in this study extends the more narrow view of corruption solely as bribery.","publish_time":"2009-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chandler, Jennifer D.; Graham, John L.","journal":"J Bus Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93f2da2db640bc5cb223858477393f583a4c8b7f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-009-0152-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["international markets","role of corruption","levels of corruption","dimensions of corruption","broader conceptualization of corruption","narrow view of corruption","global markets","target countries","international marketing success","successes of French","successes of American exporters","exporting countries","exporters\u2019 successes","study","physical distance","consumer resources","information resources","cultural distance","values differences","Japanese exporters","wealth","time zones","data","comprehensive model","France","kilometers","model\u2019s performance","alternative explanatory variables","general problems","Squares formative indicators","importance","bribery","US","example","authors"],"language":"en"},

A total of 162 fecal samples were cultivated for E. coli. Samples were also subcultivated to detect E. coli with extended-spectrum \u00DF-lactamases (ESBLs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by disk diffusion using a panel of 16 antimicrobials. In addition, isolates were screened for the presence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes mcr-1 to mcr-5. Samples from 20 (12.4%) of the camels contained antimicrobial resistant (AMR) E. coli, and 85% of the AMR isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). The highest frequency of resistance was observed to tetracycline (11.7%), followed by ampicillin and streptomycin (both 10.5%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (9.9%). Two (1.2%) of the isolates showed intermediate resistance to cefazolin and streptomycin, respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, aztreonam and kanamycin, and 86.4% of the isolates were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials used in this study. The prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL producing E. coli was 0.6%. PCR and amplicon sequencing showed that the ESBL producer belonged to E. coli phylogenetic group A, sequence type (ST) 48, and harbored bla CTX-M-15. None of the isolates contained mcr genes. The results indicate that dromedary camels in Kenya may be reservoirs of AMR E. coli, including ESBL producers, that could potentially be transmitted to humans by direct contact or via the food chain.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"N\u00FCesch-Inderbinen, Magdalena; Kindle, Patrick; Baschera, Melinda; Liljander, Anne; Jores, J\u00F6rg; Corman, Victor Max; Stephan, Roger","journal":"Scientific African","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93d4534eecee1fe4ccfb36ea1449d53323127a9c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468227620300120; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227620300120","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["AMR","PCR","ESBL"],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["AMR isolates","Escherichia coli","coli phylogenetic group","distribution of antimicrobial resistance","intermediate resistance","mcr genes","fecal samples","plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes mcr","Kenya","reservoirs of AMR","highest frequency of resistance","ESBL producers","antimicrobials","streptomycin","study","feces of healthy dromedary camels","prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL","Antimicrobial susceptibility testing","ciprofloxacin","clavulanic acid","fosfomycin","AST","sequence type","amoxycillin","extended-spectrum \u00DF-lactamases","direct contact","aztreonam","amplicon sequencing","presence","MDR","cefazolin","disk diffusion","food chain","kanamycin","ESBLs","panel","results","harbored bla CTX","humans","PCR","tetracycline","total","sulfamethoxazole","trimethoprim","ampicillin","addition"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to assess how region, patient and disease characteristics influence 14- and 45-day mortality in MERS patients. The author utilised publically available data on MERS-CoV. The study included 883 MERS patients reported between 5 January 2015 and 10 March 2017. Data on patient and disease characteristics were collected. The mean age at MERS-CoV diagnosis was 54.3 years: 69.1% were male, and 86.7% of the cases were reported from Saudi Arabia. About 40% of MERS patients studied were over the age of 60. The study estimated 14- and 45-day survival rates after initial onset of symptoms: 83.67% and 65.9%, respectively. Saudi Arabian MERS patients exhibited 4.1 and 5.0 times higher 14-day (adjusted hazard risk (aHR) = 4.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.012\u201316.921) and 45-day (aHR = 5.0; 95% CI 1.856\u201313.581) mortality risk compared with MERS patients in the Republic of Korea or other countries. Similarly, Middle Eastern MERS patients showed 5.3 and 4.1 times higher 14-day (aHR = 5.3; 95% CI 1.070\u201325.902) and 45-day (aHR = 4.1; 95% CI 1.288\u2013113.076) mortality risk compared with MERS patients in the Republic of Korea or other countries. The results demonstrated a link between mortality and geography, disease and patient factors such as regions, symptoms, source of infections, underlying medical conditions, modes of transmission, non-healthcare workers and those of older age. Educational programmes, access to healthcare and early diagnosis could be implemented as modifiable factors to reduce the higher mortality rates in MERS patients.","publish_time":"2017-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Anwar E.","journal":"Epidemiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc18a8c0477521553d74acecb7a98bd0937e79c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113020.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29271336/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s095026881700293x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","Middle Eastern MERS"],"keyphrases":["day mortality","disease characteristics of MERS","MERS-CoV diagnosis","Middle Eastern MERS patients","Saudi Arabian MERS patients","mortality risk","CoV influence mortality","higher mortality rates","aHR","day survival rates","countries","comprehensive study","international study","times higher","patient factors","Republic of Korea","older age","mean age","initial onset of symptoms","adjusted hazard risk","early diagnosis","modifiable factors","years of circulation","non-healthcare workers","publically available data","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","modes of transmission","regions","medical conditions","source of infections","access","geography","author","link","Educational programmes","variation","cases","confidence interval","results","male"],"language":"en"},

Intensive care unit of a tertiary care university teaching hospital in Canada. Patient. 41-year-old previously healthy female presenting with a nonspecific viral illness and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Intervention. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. On the second day of admission, she was found to have elevated transaminases, and, over 48 hours, she progressed to fulminant liver failure with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, refractory lactic acidosis, and shock. She progressed to respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She was started on N-acetylcysteine, a bicarbonate infusion, hemodialysis, and multiple vasopressors and inotropes. Measurements and Main Results. Despite treatment, the patient died roughly 70 hours after her initial presentation to hospital. Her postmortem liver biopsy revealed herpes simplex virus hepatitis as her cause of death. Conclusions. Herpes simplex virus must be considered in all patients presenting with liver failure of unknown cause.

The total flavonoids of Sophora tonkinensis (TFST) were inactive on the complement system but showed obvious anticomplement activity after incubated with human intestinal bacteria in vitro. In order to discover the metabolic activation of TFST by intestinal flora, the constituents of TFST and its metabolites were identified by UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS. Their anticomplement activities were evaluated through the classical and alternative pathway. As a result, eighteen flavonoids were identified, including seven flavonoid glycosides, five aglycones and six isoprenylated flavonoids. All the glycosides (daidzein-4\u2032-glucoside-rhamnoside, sophorabioside, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, ononin, trifolirhizin) were metabolized into their corresponding aglycones in different extent by human intestinal bacteria, resulting in the contents of the five aglycones were highly increased in 24 h. However, no changes have occurred on the six isoprenylated flavonoids. Interestingly, three aglycones (quercetin, formononetin and maackiain) had significantly more potent anticomplement activities than their prototype glycosides. The results indicated that the enhancement of TFST anticomplement activity was attributed to the active aglycones, especially formononetin and quercetin, produced by human intestinal bacteria. These aglycones are likely to be among the potential active components of S. tonkinensis for its inhibiting inflammation effects.","publish_time":"2020-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Xin; Lu, Yan; Chen, Shaoxin; Chen, Daofeng","journal":"Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0a7295c46d8fda6c67d9318e45b2dcf8b274bea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127204.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0731708519329528; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2020.113176; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0731708519329528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32092632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TFST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["active aglycones","corresponding aglycones","human intestinal bacteria","enhancement of TFST anticomplement activity","obvious anticomplement activity","Abstract Anticomplement activity","isoprenylated flavonoids","potent anticomplement activities","intestinal flora","constituents of TFST","metabolic activation of TFST","quercetin","total flavonoids of Sophora tonkinensis","formononetin","prototype glycosides","flavonoid glycosides","potential active components","inhibiting inflammation effects","anti-inflammatory effects of traditional Chinese herbs","important role","rutin","isoquercitrin","different extent","complement system","sophorabioside","maackiain","glucoside-rhamnoside","ononin","trifolirhizin","metabolites","LTQ","UPLC-ESI","contents","alternative pathway","order","daidzein","results","changes"],"language":"en"},

Reliable methods of detection in clinical samples are needed for a better understanding of their role in pathology. As a first step in the design of such diagnostic procedures, the sensitivities and specificities of two viral diagnostic assays were compared in an experimental cell culture model: an indirect immuno-fluorescence assay using monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral RNA from infected cells. Immunofluorescence detected human coronaviruses in cells infected at a MOI as low as 10\u22122 (log TCID50/ml=4.25 for HCV-229E and 2.0 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml=4.83 for HCV-229E and 1.84 for HCV-OC43) versus 10\u22123 (HCV-OC43) or 10\u22124 (HCV-229E) for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification (log TCID50/ml=1.75 for HCV-229E and 1.5 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml=2.3 for HCV-229E and 1.34 for HCV-OC43). There were no false positive signals with other human respiratory pathogens: influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Moreover, each assay was coronavirus serogroup-specific.

Previously, we found that MHV-JHM neurovirulence was marked by diminished expression of interferon-\u03B3 (IFN-\u03B3) mRNA and a reduced presence of CD8 T cells in the CNS concomitant with heightened macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 transcript levels and greater macrophage infiltration relative to MHV-A59 infection. Here, the ability of the S and non-spike genes to regulate these immune responses was evaluated using chimeric viruses. Chimeric viruses WTR13 and S4R22 were made on MHV-A59 variant backgrounds and, respectively, contained the S gene of MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM. Unexpectedly, genes other than S appeared to modulate events critical to viral replication and survival. Unlike unresolving MHV-JHM infections, the clearance of WTR13 and S4R22 infections coincided with strong IFN-\u03B3 transcription and an increase in the number of CD8 T cells infiltrating into the CNS. However, despite the absence of detectable viral titers, approximately 40% of S4R22-infected mice succumbed within 3 weeks, indicating that the enhanced mortality following S4R22 infection was not associated with high viral titers. Instead, similar to the MHV-JHM infection, reduced survival following S4R22 infection was observed in the presence of elevated MIP-1\u03B1 and MIP-1\u03B2 mRNA accumulation and enhanced macrophage numbers within infected brains. These observations suggest that the S protein of MHV-JHM influences neurovirulence through the induction of MIP-1\u03B1- and MIP-1\u03B2-driven macrophage immunopathology.","publish_time":"2004-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rempel, Julia D.; Murray, Shannon J.; Meisner, Jeffrey; Buchmeier, Michael J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe82c4b394122cb75a39f8b35c19adbe21e20d08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126387.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203006585; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203006585","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-JHM neurovirulence","MHV-A59 infection","neurovirulent MHV-JHM","S protein of MHV","neurovirulent MHV-A59","S gene of MHV","unresolving MHV-JHM infections","MHV-A59 variant backgrounds","S4R22 infections","induction of MIP","JHM influences neurovirulence","presence of elevated MIP","S4R22-infected mice","enhanced macrophage numbers","heightened macrophage inflammatory protein","reduced presence of CD8 T cells","\u03B2-driven macrophage immunopathology","reduced survival","Chimeric viruses WTR13","viral replication","high viral titers","greater macrophage infiltration relative","strong IFN-\u03B3 transcription","number of CD8 T cells","absence of detectable viral titers","\u03B2 mRNA accumulation","non-spike genes","CNS concomitant","clearance of WTR13","enhanced mortality","infected brains","transcript levels","increase","immune responses","diminished expression of interferon","disease outcome","events critical","weeks","Abstract Differences","ability","variations","glycoprotein","observations"],"language":"en"},

The presently available treatment with interferon plus ribavirin, has limited benefits due to adverse side effects such as anemia, depression, fatigue, and \u0022flu-like\u0022 symptoms. Herbal plants have been used for centuries against different diseases including viral diseases and have become a major source of new compounds to treat bacterial and viral diseases. MATERIAL: The present study was design to study the antiviral effect of Glycyrrhizin (GL) against HCV. For this purpose, HCV infected liver cells were treated with GL at non toxic doses and HCV titer was measured by Quantitative real time RT-PCR. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrated that GL inhibit HCV titer in a dose dependent manner and resulted in 50% reduction of HCV at a concentration of 14 \u00B1 2 \u03BCg. Comparative studies were made with interferon alpha to investigate synergistic effects, if any, between antiviral compound and interferon alpha 2a. Our data showed that GL exhibited synergistic effect when combined with interferon. Moreover, these results were verified by transiently transfecting the liver cells with HCV 3a core plasmid. The results proved that GL dose dependently inhibit the expression of HCV 3a core gene both at mRNA and protein levels while the GAPDH remained constant. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that GL inhibit HCV full length viral particles and HCV core gene expression or function in a dose dependent manner and had synergistic effect with interferon. In future, GL along with interferon will be better option to treat HCV infection.","publish_time":"2011-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ashfaq, Usman A; Masoud, Muhammad S; Nawaz, Zafar; Riazuddin, Sheikh","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89ac1ba1b647165fe0cf9cefd3dc65df8c162749.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3169469.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-9-112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21762538/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","GL","GAPDH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of HCV","HCV titer","HCV infection","reduction of HCV","GL dose","RESULTS","HCV core gene expression","HCV infected liver cells","interferon alpha","viral diseases","different diseases","synergistic effects","major cause of chronic liver diseases","dose dependent manner","permanent liver damage","core plasmid","antiviral effect of Glycyrrhizin","length viral particles","antiviral compound","present study","major source of new compounds","function","centuries","protein levels","Hepatitis C virus","Quantitative real time RT-PCR","hepatocellular carcinoma","mRNA","better option","GAPDH","depression","anemia","death","ribavirin","benefits","purpose","toxic doses","flu","fatigue","BACKGROUND","available treatment","concentration","Comparative studies","data","DISCUSSION","Herbal plants","MATERIAL","CONCLUSION","future","symptoms","\u03BCg"],"language":"en"},

However, this has likely impacted access to care for patients experiencing other conditions. We aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on access to care for patients with urgent/emergent urological conditions throughout Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A questionnaire was sent to 33 urological units in the AGILE consortium, asking clinicians to report on the number of urgent/emergent urological patients seen and/or undergoing surgery over a 3-week period during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak and a reference week prior to the outbreak. ANOVA and linear regression models were used to quantify these changes. RESULTS Data from 27 urological centres in Italy showed a decrease from 956 patients/week seen just prior to the outbreak to 291 patients/week seen by the end of the study period. There was a difference in the number of patients with urgent/emergent urological disease seen within/during the different weeks (all p values \u003C 0.05). A significant decrease in the number of patients presenting with haematuria, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, scrotal pain, renal colic, or trauma and urgent/emergent cases that required surgery was reported (all p values \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION In Italy, during the COVID-19 outbreak there has been a decrease in patients seeking help for urgent/emergent urological conditions. Restructuring of hospitals and clinics is mandatory to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the healthcare system should continue to provide adequate levels of care also to patients with other conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Porreca, Angelo; Colicchia, Michele; D\u0027Agostino, Daniele; Amenta, Michele; Corsaro, Alfio; Zaramella, Stefano; Zegna, Luisa; Gallo, Fabrizio; Schenone, Maurizio; Bozzini, Giorgio; Calori, Alberto; Pastore, Antonio L; Al Salhi, Yazan; Sciorio, Carmine; Spirito, Lorenzo; Varca, Virginia; Marenghi, Carlo; Greco, Francesco; Altieri, Vincenzo M; Verze, Paolo; Barba, Ciro; Antonelli, Alessandro; Cerruto, Maria A; Falabella, Roberto; Di Bello, Silvana; Leonardo, Costantino; Tufano, Antonio; Volpe, Alessandro; Umari, Paolo; Parma, Paolo; Nidini, Mattia; Pini, Giovannalberto; Borghesi, Marco; Terrone, Carlo; Cacciamani, Giovanni E; Sighinolfi, Maria C; Busetto, Gian Maria; Wennberg, Alexandra M; Finocchiaro, Marinella; Falsaperla, Mario; Oderda, Marco; Ceruti, Carlo; Rocco, Bernardo; Schiavina, Riccardo; Bianchi, Lorenzo; Mari, Andrea; Di Maida, Fabrizio; Dalpiaz, Orietta; Celia, Antonio; Pirozzi, Marco; Bove, Pierluigi; Iacovelli, Valerio; Cafarelli, Angelo; Cindolo, Luca; Ferrari, Giovanni; Gatti, Lorenzo; Pirola, Giacomo; Annino, Filippo; Pucci, Luigi; Romagnoli, Daniele; Artibani, Walter; Minervini, Andrea","journal":"Urologia internationalis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434207/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000508512","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergent urological patients","number of patients","emergent urological conditions","emergent urological disease","number of urgent","outbreak","urological centres","urological units","impact of COVID","emergent cases","Italy","week period","reference week","surgery","adequate levels of care","significant decrease","restructuring of hospitals","pandemic","p values","Italian healthcare system","urinary retention","coronavirus disease","study period","urinary tract infection","likely impacted access","scrotal pain","renal colic","trauma","haematuria","help","substantial burden","questionnaire","AGILE consortium","end","peak","different weeks","RESULTS Data","linear regression models","ANOVA","clinicians","clinics","PURPOSE","MATERIALS","METHODS","CONCLUSION","difference","changes"],"language":"en"},

Once ONFH occurs, it seriously reduces patients\u2019 quality of life. The matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (MMP/TIMP) system was found to play a significant role in the development of ONFH. The aim of this study was to identify the associations between 7 genes selected from the MMP/TIMP system and steroid-induced ONFH. METHODS: We genotyped 34 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 7 genes selected from the MMP/TIMP system in a case\u2013control study with 285 cases of steroid-induced ONFH and 308 healthy controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the chi-squared test, genetic model analysis, haplotype analysis, and stratification analysis. RESULTS: We found that the minor alleles of rs1940475 and rs11225395 in MMP8 were associated with a 1.32-fold increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH in the allelic model analysis (P = 0.021 and 0.022, respectively). In the genetic model analysis, we found that rs3740938, rs2012390, rs1940475, and rs11225395 were associated with an increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH. In further stratification analysis, rs3740938 and rs2012390 displayed a significantly increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH in females under the dominant (rs3740938, OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.50\u20134.83, P = 0.001; rs2012390, OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.31\u20134.03, P = 0.012) and additive (rs3740938, OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.24\u20133.29, P = 0.010; rs2012390, OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.12\u20132.80, P = 0.047) models.

Distinct viral subtypes have been suggested based on sequence comparisons and some of these have different geographical distributions. In Norway, only SAV subtype 3 have so far been identified. Little is known about viral mechanisms important for pathogenesis and transmission. Tools for detailed exploration of SAV genomes are therefore needed. RESULTS: Infectious cDNA clones in which a genome of subtype 3 SAV is under the control of a CMV promoter were constructed. The clones were designed to express proteins that are putatively identical to those previously reported for the SAVH20/03 strain. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against a part of the E2 glycoprotein in order to detect expression of the subgenomic open reading frame (ORF) encoding structural viral proteins. Transfection of the cDNA clone revealed the expression of the E2 protein by IFAT, and in serial passages of the supernatant the presence of infectious recombinant virus was confirmed through RT-PCR, IFAT and the development of a cytopathic effect similar to that seen during infection with wild type SAV. Confirmation that the recovered virus originated from the infectious plasmid was done by sequence identification of an introduced genetic tag. The recombinant virus was infectious also when an additional ORF encoding an EGFP reporter gene under the control of a second subgenomic alphavirus promoter was added. Finally, we used the system to study the effect of selected point mutations on infectivity in Chinook salmon embryo cells. While introduced mutations in nsP2(197), nsP3(263 )and nsP3(323 )severely reduced infectivity, a serine to proline mutation in E2(206 )appeared to enhance the virus titer production. CONCLUSION: We have constructed infectious clones for SAV based on a subtype 3 genome. The clones may serve as a platform for further functional studies.","publish_time":"2010-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karlsen, Marius; Villoing, Stephane; Ottem, Karl F; Rimstad, Espen; Nylund, Are","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3868d449d1d018addc42aa5f5428a08976a8b190.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2949663.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-3-241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20858233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonid"],"organizations":["SAV","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious clones","SAV subtype","Infectious cDNA clones","infectious plasmid","presence of infectious recombinant virus","wild type SAV","recovered virus","genome of subtype","detailed exploration of SAV genomes","expression","control","IFAT","Salmonid alphavirus","E2 protein","subgenomic alphavirus promoter","structural viral proteins","E2 glycoprotein","virus titer production","nsP3","viral mechanisms important","Distinct viral subtypes","additional ORF","reduced infectivity","effect of selected point mutations","sequence identification","sequence comparisons","CMV promoter","cytopathic effect similar","introduced genetic tag","subgenomic open reading frame","European aquaculture of salmonid fish","widespread pathogen","supernatant","Chinook salmon embryo cells","development","EGFP reporter gene","serine","infection","serial passages","proline mutation","RT-PCR","pathogenesis","transmission","Tools","order","platform","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","different geographical distributions","functional studies","Transfection","system","Confirmation","nsP2","Norway","CONCLUSION","SAVH20","strain","polyclonal antiserum"],"language":"en"},

Infection by this virus mainly causes sudden high fever, rashes, headache, and severe joint pain that can last for several months or years. CHIKV, a mosquito-borne arbovirus, is considered a re-emerging pathogen that has become one of the most pressing global health concerns due to a rapid increase in epidemics. Because handling of CHIKV is restricted to Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facilities, the evaluation of prophylactic vaccines or antivirals has been substantially hampered. In this study, we first iden-tified the whole structural polyprotein sequence of a CHIKV strain isolated in South Korea (KNIH/2009/77). Phylogenetic analysis showed that this sequence clustered within the East/ Central/South African CHIKV genotype. Using this sequence information, we constructed a CHIKV-pseudotyped lenti-virus expressing the structural polyprotein of the Korean CHIKV isolate (CHIKVpseudo) and dual reporter genes of green fluorescence protein and luciferase. We then developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (PBNA) using CHIKVpseudo. Results from this assay compared to those from the conventional plaque reduction neutralization test showed that our PBNA was a reliable and rapid method to evaluate the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies. More importantly, the neutralizing activities of human sera from CHIKV-infected individuals were quantitated by PBNA using CHIKVpseudo. Taken together, these results suggest that our PBNA for CHIKV may serve as a useful and safe method for testing the neutralizing activity of antibodies against CHIKV in BSL-2 facilities.","publish_time":"2019-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chung, Woo-Chang; Hwang, Kwang Yeon; Kang, Suk-Jo; Kim, Jae-Ouk; Song, Moon Jung","journal":"J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4dba1fba142b73b1cc186b953bf1203b9dcc6c31.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12275-020-9384-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768937/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV","PBNA"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["CHIKV strain","handling of CHIKV","Korean CHIKV isolate","CHIKV-infected individuals","PBNA","CHIKV-pseudotyped lenti-virus","South African CHIKV genotype","CHIKVpseudo","structural polyprotein sequence","rapid method","neutralizing activity of antibodies","efficacy of neutralizing antibodies","BSL","Chikungunya virus","facilities","sequence information","Results","neutralizing activities of human sera","rapid increase","safe method","South Korea","pseudovirus-based neutralization assay","conventional plaque reduction neutralization test","headache","dual reporter genes of green fluorescence protein","rashes","positive-sense single stranded RNA genome","sudden high fever","East","pressing global health concerns","Alphavirus genus of Togaviridae family","severe joint pain","luciferase","evaluation of prophylactic vaccines","arbovirus","Biosafety Level","antivirals","KNIH","iden","months","re-emerging pathogen","epidemics","Phylogenetic analysis","Infection","mosquito","years","study"],"language":"en"},

One example is SARS, which caused a worldwide health threat in 2003. In coronaviruses, the structural protein N (nucleocapsid protein) associates with the viral RNA to form the filamentous nucleocapsid and plays a crucial role in genome replication and transcription. The structure of Nterminal domain of MHV N protein also implicated its specific affinity with transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) RNA. Here we report the crystal structures of the two proteolytically resistant N- (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains of the N protein from murine hepatitis virus (MHV). The structure of NTD in two different crystal forms was solved to 1.5 \u00C5. The higher resolution provides more detailed structural information than previous reports, showing that the NTD structure from MHV shares a similar overall and topology structure with that of SARS-CoV and IBV, but varies in its potential surface, which indicates a possible difference in RNA-binding module. The structure of CTD was solved to 2.0-\u00C5 resolution and revealed a tightly intertwined dimer. This is consistent with analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, suggesting a dimeric assembly of the N protein. The similarity between the structures of these two domains from SARS-CoV, IBV and MHV corroborates a conserved mechanism of nucleocapsid formation for coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Yanlin; Tong, Xiaohang; Xu, Xiaoling; Li, Xuemei; Lou, Zhiyong; Rao, Zihe","journal":"Protein \u0026 Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2caf60dfdef057f9e369a4588a06f8c7fbf181d1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21203940/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-010-0079-x; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13238-010-0079-x.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV N","MHV","CTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleocapsid protein","structural protein N","structure of NTD","NTD structure","structure of Nterminal domain of MHV N protein","structure of CTD","topology structure","Coronaviruses","SARS-CoV","proteolytically resistant N","filamentous nucleocapsid","domains","viral RNA","IBV","crystal structures","RNA-binding module","conserved mechanism of nucleocapsid formation","higher resolution","\u00C5 resolution","detailed structural information","different crystal forms","specific affinity","enteric diseases","crucial role","transcriptional regulatory sequence","associates","possible difference","previous reports","dimeric assembly","causative agent of respiratory","murine hepatitis virus","TRS","analytical ultracentrifugation experiments","C-terminal","genome replication","animals","humans","potential surface","worldwide health threat","intertwined dimer","similarity","example"],"language":"en"},

They are known to efficiently evade early innate immune responses, manifesting in almost negligible expression of type-I interferons (IFN-I). This evasion strategy suggests an evolutionary conserved viral function that has evolved to prevent RNA-based sensing of infection in vertebrate hosts. Here we show that the coronavirus endonuclease (EndoU) activity is key to prevent early induction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) host cell responses. Replication of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses is greatly attenuated in vivo and severely restricted in primary cells even during the early phase of the infection. In macrophages we found immediate induction of IFN-I expression and RNase L-mediated breakdown of ribosomal RNA. Accordingly, EndoU-deficient viruses can retain replication only in cells that are deficient in IFN-I expression or sensing, and in cells lacking both RNase L and PKR. Collectively our results demonstrate that the coronavirus EndoU efficiently prevents simultaneous activation of host cell dsRNA sensors, such as Mda5, OAS and PKR. The localization of the EndoU activity at the site of viral RNA synthesis\u2013within the replicase complex\u2014suggests that coronaviruses have evolved a viral RNA decay pathway to evade early innate and intrinsic antiviral host cell responses.","publish_time":"2017-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kindler, Eveline; Gil-Cruz, Cristina; Spanier, Julia; Li, Yize; Wilhelm, Jochen; Rabouw, Huib H.; Z\u00FCst, Roland; Hwang, Mihyun; V\u2019kovski, Philip; Stalder, Hanspeter; Marti, Sabrina; Habjan, Matthias; Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa; Elliot, Ruth; Karl, Nadja; Gaughan, Christina; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.

AIMS: To identify respiratory viruses in the general population and those associated with hospitalisation in AECOPD using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), and the relationship between symptoms, viral detection and inflammatory markers. METHODS: A review of viruses detected in the general population in a health district between August 2014 and July 2015, using multiplex PCR for viruses from NPA samples. In addition, a single hospital, retrospective audit of patients admitted with suspected AECOPD was conducted. RESULTS: Of the 8811 NPA tested, 5599 (64%) were positive for at least one virus and 2069 of these were obtained from adults. In adults, the most common viruses identified were Influenza A (31%), Rhinovirus (27%) and respiratory syncytial virus A/B (10%). Most patients with AECOPD (102 of 153) had NPA sent for viral PCR testing and 59 (58%) were positive. The most common viruses identified were Influenza A (31%), Rhinovirus (24%) and respiratory syncytial virus A/B (17%) with co\u2010infecting bacteria cultured in 22 sputum samples.

Studies of immunopathogenesis in hamster infection models are challenging because of the limited availability of reagents needed to define cellular and molecular determinants. RESULTS: We sequenced a hamster cDNA library and developed a first-generation custom cDNA microarray that included 5131 unique cDNAs enriched for immune response genes. We used this microarray to interrogate the hamster spleen response to Leishmania donovani, an intracellular protozoan that causes visceral leishmaniasis. The hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis is of particular interest because it recapitulates clinical and immunopathological features of human disease, including cachexia, massive splenomegaly, pancytopenia, immunosuppression, and ultimately death. In the microarray a differentially expressed transcript was identified as having at least a 2-fold change in expression between uninfected and infected groups and a False Discovery Rate of \u003C5%. Following a relatively silent early phase of infection (at 7 and 14 days post-infection only 8 and 24 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed), there was dramatic upregulation of inflammatory and immune-related genes in the spleen (708 differentially expressed genes were evident at 28 days post-infection). The differentially expressed transcripts included genes involved in inflammation, immunity, and immune cell trafficking. Of particular interest there was concomitant upregulation of the IFN-\u03B3 and interleukin (IL)-4 signaling pathways, with increased expression of a battery of IFN-\u03B3- and IL-4-responsive genes. The latter included genes characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional profiling was accomplished in the Syrian golden hamster, for which a fully annotated genome is not available. In the hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis, a robust and functional IFN-\u03B3 response did not restrain parasite load and progression of disease. This supports the accumulating evidence that macrophages are ineffectively activated to kill the parasite. The concomitant expression of IL-4/IL-13 and their downstream target genes, some of which were characteristic of alternative macrophage activation, are likely to contribute to this. Further dissection of mechanisms that lead to polarization of macrophages toward a permissive state is needed to fully understand the pathogenesis of visceral leishmaniasis.

Moreover, the epidemic prevalence increases with the increase of heterogeneity around the epidemic threshold, while the converse situation holds when the infection rate is much greater than the epidemic threshold.","publish_time":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chanchan; Jiang, Guo-ping; Song, Yurong; Xia, Lingling; Li, Yinwei; Song, Bo","journal":"J Parallel Distrib Comput","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0486ec801eb4e43086b6221019c9860b2086af17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127304.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2018.04.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0743731518302685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288171/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731518302685","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic prevalence","epidemic dynamics","epidemic threshold of entire network decreases","new community network model","heterogeneous community network","novel mathematical epidemic model","increase of heterogeneity","community structure","different communities","infection rate","initial infection node","large number of real world networks","spreading velocity","converse situation","significant differences","average degree","location","paper"],"language":"en"},

Objective We sought to investigate whether the duration of wheezy episodes in young children depends on the microbial trigger. Methods Two hundred eighty-three children from the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood2000 at-risk birth cohort were prospectively examined for common airway pathogenic bacteria and viruses during acute wheezy episodes in the first 3 years of life. Findings were related to symptomatic duration of episodes, as monitored in daily diary cards from birth. Results Eight hundred thirty-seven samples were investigated for viruses, bacteria, or both. Both viruses and bacteria were identified in 55% of episodes, bacteria were identified exclusively in 31% of episodes, and viruses were identified exclusively in 10% of episodes. The median duration of acute symptoms was 9 days (interquartile range, 5-16 days), and duration was independent of bacterial or viral species. Conclusions The duration of wheezy episodes was independent of pathogenic airway bacterial or viral species. This suggests that symptom burden from infections is dependent on other factors, such as environmental exposures or host factors. The common term viral wheeze seems inappropriate in view of the finding of pathogenic bacteria in 86% of wheezy episodes.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carlsson, Christian J.; Vissing, Nadja H.; Sevelsted, Astrid; Johnston, Sebastian L.; B\u00F8nnelykke, Klaus; Bisgaard, Hans","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba7b8836962a0ac4f39544acba17a59d5c699371.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172099.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674915006958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26100088/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674915006958; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2015.05.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["duration of wheezy episodes","acute wheezy episodes","symptomatic duration of episodes","Background Wheezy episodes","symptom duration","viruses","common airway pathogenic bacteria","viral species","finding of pathogenic bacteria","independent of pathogenic airway bacterial","young children","independent of bacterial","median duration of acute symptoms","common term viral wheeze","days","bacterial respiratory tract infections","specific microbial trigger","symptom burden","host factors","Childhood2000 at-risk birth cohort","Asthma","view","Copenhagen Prospective Study","little evidence","interquartile range","environmental exposures","hypothesis","daily diary cards","samples","Conclusions","Findings","years of life","Results","Methods","Objective"],"language":"en"},

A better understanding of how vaccines work for providing protection will help to improve current vaccines as well as to develop effective vaccines against pathogens for which we do not have a proper means to control. Recent studies have focused on innate immunity as the first line of host defense and its role in inducing adaptive immunity; such studies have been an intense area of research, which will reveal the immunological mechanisms how vaccines work for protection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a family of receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns on cells of the innate immune system, play a critical role in detecting and responding to microbial infections. Importantly, the innate immune system modulates the quantity and quality of longterm T and B cell memory and protective immune responses to pathogens. Limited studies suggest that vaccines which mimic natural infection and/or the structure of pathogens seem to be effective in inducing long-term protective immunity. A better understanding of the similarities and differences of the molecular and cellular events in host responses to vaccination and pathogen infection would enable the rationale for design of novel preventive measures against many challenging pathogens.","publish_time":"2009-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Sang-Moo; Compans, Richard W.","journal":"Mol Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b16e5ea6902ab84e40164075fa83741d8b877b53.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19214429/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10059-009-0015-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["successful vaccines","current vaccines","availability of effective vaccines","innate immunity","challenging pathogens","structure of pathogens","innate immune system","protective immune responses","new emerging pathogens","host responses","pathogen infection","long-term protective immunity","adaptive immunity","Recent studies","Limited studies","protection","better understanding","molecular patterns","critical role","natural infection","family of receptors","quality of longterm T","quality of public health","line of host defense","B cell memory","rationale","differences","cellular events","vaccination","quantity","cells","design of novel preventive measures","profound positive effect","TLRs","similarities","infectious diseases","immunological mechanisms","intense area of research","Toll","microbial infections","vaccine available","proper means"],"language":"en"},

Through the construction of recombinant IBV expressing proteins 8a, 8b and 8ab encoded by SARS-CoV ORF8, we demonstrate that expression of 8b and 8ab enables the corresponding recombinant viruses to partially overcome the inhibitory actions of IFN activation to achieve higher replication efficiencies in cells. We also found that proteins 8b and 8ab could physically interact with IRF3. Overexpression of 8b and 8ab resulted in the reduction of poly (I:C)-induced IRF3 dimerization and inhibition of the IFN-\u03B2 signaling pathway. This counteracting effect was partially mediated by protein 8b/8ab-induced degradation of IRF3 in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. Taken together, we propose that SARS-CoV may exploit the unique functions of proteins 8b and 8ab as novel mechanisms to overcome the effect of IFN response during virus infection.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Hui Hui; Fung, To Sing; Fang, Shouguo; Huang, Mei; Le, My Tra; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a505bc758597840492a4450da21505c5591c313a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112132.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217304427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294448/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217304427; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.12.028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN production","IFN-\u03B2","effect of IFN response","ab-induced degradation of IRF3","various proteins","SARS-CoV ORF8","inhibitory actions of IFN activation","induced IRF3 dimerization","unique functions of proteins","distinct mechanisms","novel mechanisms","counteracting effect","corresponding recombinant viruses","construction of recombinant IBV","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","higher replication efficiencies","ubiquitin-proteasome","different levels","inhibition","inefficient inducer of interferon","virus infection","dependent manner","cells","reduction of poly","pathway","Overexpression"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, focus has turned to re-purposing of existing, licenced medicines that may limit the morbidity and mortality rates of EBOV and could be used immediately. Here we test three such medicines and measure their ability to inhibit pseudotype viruses (PVs) of two EBOV species, Marburg virus (MARV) and avian influenza H5 (FLU-H5).

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia currently represents a worldwide health problem; the correlations between cardiovascular disease, myocardial injury and SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unclear, but initial data show that myocardial damage represents a negative prognostic factor. Myocardial injury during SARS-CoV-2, as defined by a pathological rise in circulating troponin levels, is not an uncommon complication in hospitalized patients, and is significantly more frequent in intensive care unit patients and among those who died. In this setting, myocardial injury is mainly secondary to type 2 myocardial infarction (mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply and demand during respiratory failure); other causes include myocarditis, coronary thrombosis, sepsis or septic shock.

RS is commonly classified into acute and chronic RS based on symptom duration. In acute RS, an inflammatory reaction initiated by a viral infection characterizes most uncomplicated, mild to moderate cases. Therefore, the first line of treatment for these cases are intranasal steroids and not antibiotics. In severe and complicated cases, antibiotics combined with topical steroids remain the treatment of choice. On the other hand, chronic RS is actually subdivided into two distinct entities (chronic rhinosinusitis with and without polyps), as growing evidence indicates that these entities have specific inflammatory pathways and cytokine profiles.

Phase I included an evaluation of 45 DCCs (25 from Lisbon and 20 from Oporto, targeting 5161 children). In this phase, building characteristics, indoor CO2 and air temperature/relative humidity, were assessed. A children\u0027s respiratory health questionnaire derived from the ISAAC (International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Children) was also distributed. Phase II encompassed two evaluations and included 20 DCCs selected from phase I after a cluster analysis (11 from Lisbon and 9 from Oporto, targeting 2287 children). In this phase, data on ventilation, IAQ, thermal comfort parameters, respiratory and allergic health, airway inflammation biomarkers, respiratory virus infection patterns and parental and child stress were collected. Results In Phase I, building characteristics, occupant behavior and ventilation surrogates were collected from all DCCs. The response rate of the questionnaire was 61.7% (3186 children). Phase II included 1221 children. Association results between DCC characteristics, IAQ and health outcomes will be provided in order to support recommendations on IAQ and children\u0027s health.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate rhinovirus infections during peak seasons in children with asthma, and to analyze relationships between viral infection and illness severity. METHODS: Fifty-eight children with asthma ages 6-8 years provided 5 consecutive weekly nasal lavage samples during September and April; symptoms, medication use, and peak flow were recorded. Rhinoviruses were identified using multiplex PCR and partial sequencing of viral genomes. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 36-50% of the specimens, and, 72-99% of the viruses were rhinoviruses. There were 52 different strains (including 16 HRV-C) among the 169 rhinovirus isolates; no strains found in more than two collection periods, and all but two children had a respiratory infection. Virus-positive weeks were associated with greater cold and asthma severity (p\u003C0.0001 and p=0.0002 respectively). Furthermore, virus-positive illnesses had increased duration and severity of cold and asthma symptoms, and more frequent loss of asthma control (47% vs. 22%, p=0.008). While allergen-sensitized vs. non-sensitized children had the same number of viral infections, the former had 47% more symptomatic viral illnesses (1.19 vs. 0.81 per month, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Rhinovirus infections are nearly universal in children with asthma during common cold seasons, likely due to a plethora of new strains appearing each season. Illnesses associated with viruses have greater duration and severity. Finally, atopic asthmatic children experienced more frequent and severe viral-induced illnesses. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The combination of viral infection and allergy increases the morbidity of respiratory illness in children with asthma.","publish_time":"2010-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olenec, Jaime P; Kim, Woo Kyung; Lee, Wai-Ming; Vang, Fue; Pappas, Tressa E; Salazar, Lisa EP; Evans, Michael D; Bork, Jack; Roberg, Kathleen; Lemanske, Robert F; Gern, James E","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/365b863ed4e9eeab4027cd17c9dcbd19b967d622.json; document_parses/pdf_json/61025296e0cb8f5a84d75c751fbab2b8ce78861f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2866802.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2866802?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20392488/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674910003556; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674910003556; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2010.01.059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma severity","asthma symptoms","asthma ages","rhinovirus infections","number of viral infections","seasonal asthma morbidity","symptomatic viral illnesses","Exacerbations of childhood asthma","combination of viral infection","severity of cold","non-sensitized children","frequent loss of asthma control","severe viral-induced illnesses","illness severity","atopic asthmatic children","virus-positive illnesses","peak seasons","partial sequencing of viral genomes","rhinovirus isolates","respiratory infection","common cold seasons","greater duration","peak flow","morbidity of respiratory illness","different strains","Rhinoviruses","Virus-positive weeks","plethora of new strains","increased duration","years","allergy","major contributors","multiplex PCR","consecutive weekly nasal lavage samples","spring","relationships","medication use","fall","HRV-C","CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","allergen","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","collection periods","month","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","specimens"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the role of bat ectoparasites in transmitting and maintaining such viruses. The intricate relationship between bats and their ectoparasites suggests that ectoparasites might serve as viral vectors, but evidence to date is scant. Bat flies, in particular, are highly specialized obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that incidentally bite humans. Using next-generation sequencing, we discovered a novel ledantevirus (mononegaviral family Rhabdoviridae, genus Ledantevirus) in nycteribiid bat flies infesting pteropodid bats in western Uganda. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that both the bat flies and their bat hosts belong to putative new species. The coding-complete genome of the new virus, named Kanyawara virus (KYAV), is only distantly related to that of its closest known relative, Mount Elgon bat virus, and was found at high titers in bat flies but not in blood or on mucosal surfaces of host bats. Viral genome analysis indicates unusually low CpG dinucleotide depletion in KYAV compared to other ledanteviruses and rhabdovirus groups, with KYAV displaying values similar to rhabdoviruses of arthropods. Our findings highlight the possibility of a yet-to-be-discovered diversity of potentially pathogenic viruses in bat ectoparasites.","publish_time":"2017-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goldberg, Tony L.; Bennett, Andrew J.; Kityo, Robert; Kuhn, Jens H.; Chapman, Colin A.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/699ffcdbc72afc6d6243a7d0dbd50cc055d03aeb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5509700.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28706276/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-05236-w","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","CpG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat hosts","role of bat ectoparasites","nycteribiid bat flies","Mount Elgon bat virus","new virus","Nipah virus","Marburg virus","Kanyawara virus","KYAV","pteropodid bats","specialized obligate hematophagous ectoparasites","mucosal surfaces of host bats","Viral genome analysis","genus Ledantevirus","novel ledantevirus","viral vectors","pathogenic viruses","discovered diversity","natural reservoir hosts","putative new species","coding-complete genome","low CpG dinucleotide depletion","virulent pathogens","mononegaviral family Rhabdoviridae","values similar","rhabdovirus groups","ledanteviruses","blood","western Uganda","evidence","date","transmitting","rhabdoviruses of arthropods","SARS coronavirus","high titers","humans","Mitochondrial DNA analyses","intricate relationship","generation sequencing","findings","possibility"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease and 74 with severe disease. Data were collected from 19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples. Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid concentration, were plotted onto the standard curve constructed on the basis of the standard product. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. RESULTS: 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Infection was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum and saliva samples. RNA was detected in the stool of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) patients. The urine sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The median duration of virus in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P\u003C0.001). The median duration of virus in the respiratory samples of patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04). In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in respiratory samples in the second week from disease onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during the third week in the severe group. Virus duration was longer in patients older than 60 years and in male patients. CONCLUSION: The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of patients with severe disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Shufa; Fan, Jian; Yu, Fei; Feng, Baihuan; Lou, Bin; Zou, Qianda; Xie, Guoliang; Lin, Sha; Wang, Ruonan; Yang, Xianzhi; Chen, Weizhen; Wang, Qi; Zhang, Dan; Liu, Yanchao; Gong, Renjie; Ma, Zhaohui; Lu, Siming; Xiao, Yanyan; Gu, Yaxi; Zhang, Jinming; Yao, Hangping; Xu, Kaijin; Lu, Xiaoyang; Wei, Guoqing; Zhou, Jianying; Fang, Qiang; Cai, Hongliu; Qiu, Yunqing; Sheng, Jifang; Chen, Yu; Liang, Tingbo","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190077.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32317267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["days","respiratory samples of patients","respiratory tissue of patients","serum samples","severe disease","patients older","male patients","urine samples","mild disease","management of stool samples","saliva samples","SARS-CoV","disease severity","disease onset","duration of SARS","RNA viral load","Virus duration","viral loads","severe group","median duration of virus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","clinical data","different stages of disease progression","outcomes data","higher load","mild group","data collection forms","week","Zhejiang province","epidemic","China","infection","Ribonucleic acid","laboratory characteristics","standard curve","standard product","measure of nucleic acid concentration","relation","electronic medical records","treatment","covid","prevention","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","Cycle threshold values","basis","designated hospital","peaks","testing sputum","years","control","need","interquartile range","admission","Retrospective cohort study","months","SETTING","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","PARTICIPANTS"],"language":"en"},

Polymerase chain reaction-based assays, direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) assays, and viral cultures can detect viruses in samples from the human respiratory tract, but the presence of the virus does not prove it to be a pathogen, nor does it give information regarding the interaction of viruses with the host immune response and bacterial flora of the respiratory tract. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provided a better understanding of how viral pathogens mediate lung injury. Although the viruses initially infect the respiratory epithelium, the relative role of epithelial damage and endothelial dysfunction has not been well defined. The inflammatory host immune response to H1N1 infection is a major contributor to lung injury. The SARS coronavirus causes lung injury and inflammation in part through actions on the nonclassical renin angiotensin pathway. The lessons learned from the pandemic outbreaks of SARS coronavirus and H1N1 capture key principles of virally mediated ALI. There are pathogen-specific pathways underlying virally mediated ALI that converge onto a common end pathway resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. In terms of therapy, lung protective ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive care. There is little evidence that corticosteroids are beneficial, and they might be harmful. Future therapeutic strategies may be targeted to specific pathogens, the pathogenetic pathways in the host immune response, or enhancing repair and regeneration of tissue damage.","publish_time":"2013-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hendrickson, Carolyn M.; Matthay, Michael A.","journal":"Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/452999d6c082684697ac9f9960b078d310719c7f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6e5ff0f99e4a069dadc4d36cf881b1f6bce05674.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4045622.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23934716/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1351122; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4045622?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral pathogens","mediated ALI","important cause of acute lung injury","Acute viral pneumonia","H1N1 infection","inflammatory host immune response","respiratory epithelium","viral cultures","lung protective ventilation","human respiratory tract","severe acute respiratory syndrome","H1N1 influenza pandemic","pandemic outbreaks of SARS coronavirus","exact incidence of viral infection","specific pathogens","interaction of viruses","pathogen-specific pathways","diffuse alveolar damage","regeneration of tissue damage","relative role of epithelial damage","pathogenetic pathways","common end pathway","nonclassical renin angiotensin pathway","Polymerase chain reaction-based assays","direct fluorescent antigen","DFA","epidemic","better understanding","actions","repair","samples","key principles","bacterial flora","endothelial dysfunction","major contributor","inflammation","cornerstone of supportive care","terms of therapy","presence","little evidence","corticosteroids","Future therapeutic strategies","information","lessons"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we formulate such a quarantine vehicle scheduling problem for high-risk individual transfer, which is more difficult than most well-known vehicle routing problems. To efficiently solve this problem, we propose a hybrid algorithm based on the water wave optimization (WWO) metaheuristic and neighborhood search. The metaheuristic uses a small population to rapidly explore the solution space, and the neighborhood search uses a gradual strategy to improve the solution accuracy. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several existing algorithms and obtains high-quality solutions on real-world problem instances for high-risk individual transfer in Hangzhou, China, during the peak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Min-Xia; Yan, Hong-Fan; Wu, Jia-Yu; Zheng, Yu-Jun","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6241532056890d91f3ab478a64f122f4c64cae3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177222.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32230995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["high-risk individuals","high-risk individual transfer","quarantine vehicle scheduling problem","neighborhood search","metaheuristic","epidemic areas","real-world problem instances","available quarantine vehicles","large-scale epidemic outbreak","proposed algorithm","hybrid algorithm","solution space","solution accuracy","well-known vehicle routing problems","high-quality solutions","water wave optimization","WWO","China","Hangzhou","peak period","existing algorithms","novel coronavirus pneumonia","gradual strategy","different locations","medical isolation","small population","COVID","Computational results","spread","regions","paper"],"language":"en"},

Thus, IFITM proteins act additively in both productively infected cells and uninfected target cells to inhibit HIV-1 spread, potentially conferring these proteins with greater breadth and potency against enveloped viruses.","publish_time":"2014-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Compton, Alex A.; Bruel, Timoth\u00E9e; Porrot, Fran\u00E7oise; Mallet, Adeline; Sachse, Martin; Euvrard, Marine; Liang, Chen; Casartelli, Nicoletta; Schwartz, Olivier","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c82da830a1c39e95221fdebc053321d4b2e7b57c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/30c8aeb3d1a3a143f354b3873da2723c21cfe443.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104936.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2014.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464829/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312814003977; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312814003977","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFITM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFITM proteins","Gag proteins","virus-cell fusion","spread","cell-free virus infection","uninfected target cells","infected cells","nascent HIV","diverse virus infections","new target cells","uninfected lymphocytes","viral membranes","viral Env","impaired virion fusion","protective effects","greater breadth","potency","virions","entry","enveloped viruses","restriction","potent defense","replication","mechanisms","interferon","present"],"language":"en"},

PRRS virus (PRRSV) replicates mainly in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) and develops persistent infections, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), interstitial pneumonia and immunosuppression. But the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection still are poorly understood. Here we report on the first genome-wide host transcriptional responses to classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a infection using Solexa/Illumina\u0027s digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag-based high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method, and analyse systematically the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after N-PRRSV infection and infection pathology. Our results suggest that N-PRRSV appeared to utilize multiple strategies for its replication and spread in infected pigs, including subverting host innate immune response, inducing an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory state as well as developing ADE. Upregulation expression of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes and inflammatory cells, antibodies, complement activation were likely to result in the development of inflammatory responses during N-PRRSV infection processes. N-PRRSV-induced immunosuppression might be mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which caused depletion of immune cells and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they were unable to eradicate the primary infection. Our systems analysis will benefit for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of N-PRRSV infection, developing novel antiviral therapies and identifying genetic components for swine resistance/susceptibility to PRRS.","publish_time":"2010-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Shuqi; Jia, Jianyu; Mo, Delin; Wang, Qiwei; Qin, Limei; He, Zuyong; Zhao, Xiao; Huang, Yuankai; Li, Anning; Yu, Jingwei; Niu, Yuna; Liu, Xiaohong; Chen, Yaosheng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eaccbbd4d93f295b6c22ae217f159c288b29deb6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2894071.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20614006/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011377","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","Solexa/Illumina","ADE","PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N-PRRSV infection processes","molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection","inflammatory cells","infection pathology","primary infection","molecular pathogenesis of N","classical North American type PRRSV","inflammatory enzymes","dendritic cells","PRRS virus","induced immunosuppression","development of inflammatory responses","depletion of immune cells","apoptosis of infected cells","pro-inflammatory cytokines","immune response","Upregulation expression of virus","developing ADE","Illumina\u0027s digital gene expression","pulmonary gene expression profiles","anti-inflammatory cytokine response","swine industry","subverting host","swine resistance","anti-inflammatory state","infected pigs","genome-wide host transcriptional responses","porcine alveolar macrophages","adhesion molecules","genetic components","chemokines","Solexa","novel antiviral therapies","antibody-dependent enhancement","DGE","PAMs","antibodies","replicates","persistent infections","strain CH","high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method","tag","DCs","susceptibility","relationship","great economic losses","interstitial pneumonia","replication","respiratory syndrome","activation","multiple strategies","year","important diseases","results","systems analysis"],"language":"en"},

As in other tissues, it has been found that acute T-cell infiltration may be followed by establishment of persistent local T-cell memory. To improve our understanding regarding the regulation of putative tissue resident memory T (Trm) cells in CNS, we devised a new model system for studying the generation of Trm cells in this site. To this purpose, we exploited the fact that the CNS may be a sanctuary for adenoviral infection, and to minimize virus-induced disease, we chose replication-deficient adenoviruses for infection of the CNS. Non-replicating adenoviruses are known to be highly immunogenic, and our studies demonstrate that intracerebral inoculation causes marked local T-cell recruitment, which is followed by persistent infiltration of the CNS parenchyma by antigen specific CD8(\u002B) T cells. Phenotypical analysis of CNS infiltrating antigen specific CD8(\u002B) T cells was consistent with these cells being Trms. Regarding the long-term stability of the infiltrate, resident CD8(\u002B) T cells expressed high levels of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 as well as the proliferation marker Ki-67 suggesting that the population is maintained through steady homeostatic proliferation. Functionally, memory CD8(\u002B) T cells from CNS matched peripheral memory cells with regard to capacity for ex vivo cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Most importantly, our experiments revealed a key role for local antigen encounter in the establishment of sustained CD8(\u002B) T-cell memory in the brain. Inflammation in the absence of cognate antigen only led to limited and transient infiltration by antigen specific CD8(\u002B) T cells. Together these results indicate that memory CD8(\u002B) T cells residing in the CNS predominantly mirror previous local infections and immune responses to local autoantigens.","publish_time":"2019-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00F8ller, Amalie S.; Fonnes, Masja; Nazerai, Loulieta; Christensen, Jan P.; Thomsen, Allan R.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7ff81d2d3ae773aa28836cc485617983d7499ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6409353.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886617/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","memory CD8","peripheral memory cells","local T-cell recruitment","establishment of persistent local T-cell memory","acute T-cell infiltration","resident CD8","CNS parenchyma","generation of Trm cells","Phenotypical analysis of CNS infiltrating antigen specific CD8","local antigen encounter","regulation of putative tissue resident memory T","establishment of sustained CD8","local autoantigens","persistent infiltration","previous local infections","absence of cognate antigen","case of infection","immune responses","adenoviral infection","transient infiltration","immune-privileged site","brain","focus of immune mediated inflammation","replication-deficient adenoviruses","steady homeostatic proliferation","Non-replicating adenoviruses","proliferation marker Ki","capacity","regard","high levels","intracerebral inoculation causes","certain autoimmune diseases","cytotoxicity","anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl","key role","studies","population","new model system","infiltrate","virus-induced disease","multiple sclerosis","cytokine production","long-term stability","understanding","experiments","sanctuary","fact","Trms","results","purpose","tissues"],"language":"en"},

Study Design Pregnant rats were infected intravenously at gestation day 14 with 0 (control), 101, 103, 105, and 107 colony forming units of M pulmonis and necropsied at gestational day 18. Quantitative culture of maternal and fetal tissues as well as histopathologic examination of the placenta were performed. Results We have characterized a rat model of maternal and fetal infection that can be manipulated by alteration of infectious dose. Colonization of Sprague-Dawley rat dam and fetal tissues by M pulmonis occurred in a dose-dependent manner after intravenous inoculation (P \u003C .001). Placental lesion severity increased with infection dose (P = .0001). The minimum threshold dose required to establish infection of the dam and fetus was at least 103 colony forming units, with consistent colonization of maternal and fetal tissues achieved only with 107 colony forming units. In some instances, rat fetal tissues could be colonized in the absence of concomitant amniotic fluid colonization. Interestingly, there appeared to be a predilection for colonization of the reproductive tissues. Conclusions In the Sprague-Dawley rat, the infection rate of both the dam and fetus can be controlled by the inoculum dose. Our data support the concept that hematogenous spread of M pulmonis to the rat fetus can occur without amniotic fluid infection and suggest that the fetus itself can potentially seed the amniotic fluid with microorganisms. Importantly, manipulation of both the route of infection as well as infection dose provide a reproducible way to study both maternal and fetal immune response to infection during pregnancy.","publish_time":"2008-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riggs, Margaret A.; Maunsell, Fiona P.; Reyes, Leticia; Brown, Mary B.","journal":"American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2eab2fbd24dc5f5d44edbb5a925570e4dca3a342.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118712.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937807011866; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937807011866","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fetal infection","infection dose","rat fetal tissues","intrauterine infection","infection rate","route of infection","amniotic fluid infection","rat fetus","rat model of maternal","inoculum dose","Dawley rat dam","dose response experiment","innate fetal immune response","Colonization of Sprague","consistent colonization of maternal","reproductive tissues","dose-dependent manner","minimum threshold dose","alteration of infectious dose","colony","units","Sprague-Dawley rats","Mycoplasma pulmonis","reproducible animal model of maternal","absence of concomitant amniotic fluid colonization","Quantitative culture of maternal","Study Design Pregnant rats","reproducible way","gestation day","gestational day","intravenous inoculation","versatile mechanism","hematogenous spread","Placental lesion severity","concept","histopathologic examination","pregnancy","data","Objectives","specific objective","predilection","Conclusions","instances","control","manipulation","microorganisms"],"language":"en"},

The complement system consists of over 50 blood-circulating, cell-surface expressed and intracellular proteins. It is key in the recognition and elimination of invading pathogens, also in the removal of self-derived danger such as apoptotic cells, and it supports innate immune responses and the initiation of the general inflammatory reactions. The long prevailing classic view of complement was that of a serum-operative danger sensor and first line of defence system, however, recent experimental and clinical evidences have demonstrated that \u201Clocal\u201D tissue and surprisingly intracellular complement (the complosome) activation impacts on normal cell physiology.

Five interdisciplinary case studies addressed zoonotic diseases in African settings: Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Kenya, human African trypanosomiasis in Zambia and Zimbabwe, Lassa fever in Sierra Leone and henipaviruses in Ghana. Each explored how ecological changes and human\u2013ecosystem interactions affect pathogen dynamics and hence the likelihood of zoonotic spillover and transmission, and how socially differentiated peoples\u2019 interactions with ecosystems and animals affect their exposure to disease. Cross-case analysis highlights how these dynamics vary by ecosystem type, across a range from humid forest to semi-arid savannah; the significance of interacting temporal and spatial scales; and the importance of mosaic and patch dynamics. Ecosystem interactions and services central to different people\u0027s livelihoods and well-being include pastoralism and agro-pastoralism, commercial and subsistence crop farming, hunting, collecting food, fuelwood and medicines, and cultural practices.

The soluble ectodomain of ACE2 specifically abrogated S-mediated infection and might therefore be exploited for the generation of inhibitors. Deletion of a major portion of the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 had no effect on S-driven infection, indicating that this domain is not important for receptor function.

Development of well-tolerated regimens with high cure rates and fewer side effects is still much needed. Recently, natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attracting more attention as biological compounds and can be a good template to develop therapeutic agents, including antiviral agents against a variety of viruses. Various AMPs have been characterized from the venom of different venomous animals including scorpions. METHODS: The possible antiviral activities of crude venoms obtained from five Egyptian scorpion species (Leiurus quinquestriatus, Androctonus amoreuxi, A. australis, A. bicolor and Scorpio maurus palmatus) were evaluated by a cell culture method using Huh7.5 cells and the J6/JFH1-P47 strain of HCV. Time-of-addition experiments and inactivation of enzymatic activities of the venoms were carried out to determine the characteristics of the anti-HCV activities. RESULTS: S. maurus palmatus and A. australis venoms showed anti-HCV activities, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) being 6.3 \u00B1 1.6 and 88.3 \u00B1 5.8 \u03BCg/ml, respectively. S. maurus palmatus venom (30 \u03BCg/ml) impaired HCV infectivity in culture medium, but not inside the cells, through virocidal effect. The anti-HCV activity of this venom was not inhibited by a metalloprotease inhibitor or heating at 60\u00B0C. The antiviral activity was directed preferentially against HCV. CONCLUSIONS: S. maurus palmatus venom is considered as a good natural source for characterization and development of novel anti-HCV agents targeting the entry step. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing antiviral activities of Egyptian scorpion venoms against HCV, and may open a new approach towards discovering antiviral compounds derived from scorpion venoms.","publish_time":"2015-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Bitar, Alaa MH; Sarhan, Moustafa MH; Aoki, Chie; Takahara, Yusuke; Komoto, Mari; Deng, Lin; Moustafa, Mohsen A; Hotta, Hak","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9413ac12d29207f16ff2983940960e00f296ec15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4374190.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889296/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0276-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-HCV activities","anti-HCV activity","antiviral activities of Egyptian scorpion venoms","antiviral agents","maurus palmatus venom","development of novel anti-HCV agents","impaired HCV infectivity","australis venoms","antiviral compounds","antiviral activity","possible antiviral activities of crude venoms","JFH1-P47 strain of HCV","Scorpio maurus palmatus","inactivation of enzymatic activities","Egyptian scorpion species","therapeutic agents","cells","\u03BCg","venom of different venomous animals","good natural source","chronic hepatitis","good template","culture medium","biological compounds","Various AMPs","Hepatitis C virus","cell culture method","natural antimicrobial peptides","Development of well-tolerated regimens","high cure rates","characterization","Leiurus quinquestriatus","fewer","Androctonus amoreuxi","major global health problem","liver cirrhosis","effects","J6","Huh7","addition experiments","report","hepatocellular carcinoma","entry step","scorpions","BACKGROUND","inhibitory concentrations","new approach","attention","heating","variety of viruses","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","characteristics","metalloprotease inhibitor","Time","virocidal effect","RESULTS","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

It is highly variable in its expression and severity. It is believed to be autoimmune in nature. The cause is unknown; both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis. MS generally presents with the acute or subacute onset of neurologic abnormalities that may wax and wane over many years. Diagnosis is generally made by means of observation of the clinical course in conjunction with a neurologic examination and laboratory tests. These tests may include magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine, lumbar puncture, and evoked potentials. Treatment is based on general supportive care, the use of corticosteroids for relapses, and symptomatic management of ongoing problems. The frequency of relapses can be reduced with interferon-\u03B2 (Betaseron). Copolymer 1 and interferon-\u03B2 la are being evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval for use for reduction in the frequency of relapses in relapsing-remitting MS. Treatment of chronic progression is often attempted with immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide. Use of other agents is being investigated.","publish_time":"1996-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lynch, Sharon G.; Rose, John W.","journal":"Disease-a-Month","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3744e7581b12fe33a93e21e89b5da988b790b4b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0011502996900127; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011502996900127","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. Food and Drug Administration"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of corticosteroids","frequency of relapses","interferon-\u03B2","Treatment of chronic progression","chronic disease","neurologic examination","laboratory tests","immunosuppressive agents","subacute onset of neurologic abnormalities","spine","head","conjunction","lumbar puncture","approval","reduction","magnetic resonance imaging","general supportive care","clinical course","Drug Administration","symptomatic management of ongoing problems","late adolescence","Abstract Multiple sclerosis","azathioprine","relapsing","environmental factors","evoked potentials","Food","observation","wane","expression","severity","cause","adulthood","cyclophosphamide","Betaseron","Copolymer","nature","years","pathogenesis","Diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

The existing literature fails to examine what caused this sudden outbreak from a crisis management perspective. This article attempts to fill this research gap through analysis of big data, officially released information and other social media sources to understand the root cause of the crisis as it relates to China\u0027s current management system and public health policy. The article draws the following conclusions: firstly, strict government control over information was the main reason for the early silencing of media announcements, which directly caused most people to be unprepared and unaware of COVID-19. Secondly, a choice between addressing a virus with an unknown magnitude and nature, and mitigating known public panic during a politically and culturally sensitive time, lead to falsehood and concealment. Thirdly, the weak autonomous management power of local public health management departments is not conducive for providing a timely response to the crisis. Finally, the privatization of many state-owned hospitals led to the unavailability of public health medical resources to serve affected patients in the Wuhan and Hubei Province. This article suggests that China should adopt a Singaporean-style public health crisis information management system to ensure information disclosure and information symmetry and should use it to monitor public health crises in real time. In addition, the central government should adopt the territorial administration model of a public health crisis and increase investment in public health in China.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shangguan, Ziheng; Wang, Mark Yaolin; Sun, Wen","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397199/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093279","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["public health policy","public health crises","worldwide public health crisis","public panic","Singaporean-style public health crisis information management system","unavailability of public health medical resources","crisis management perspective","weak autonomous management power of local public health management departments","information disclosure","information symmetry","article","China\u0027s current management system","Wuhan","unaware of COVID","central government","sensitive time","real time","known case","strict government control","social media sources","early silencing of media announcements","affected patients","territorial administration model","nature","main reason","investment","research gap","mitigating","analysis of big data","following conclusions","root cause","infected patient","virus","unknown magnitude","lead","falsehood","sudden outbreak","Hubei Province","state-owned hospitals","people","concealment","timely response","countries","privatization","addition","existing literature","choice"],"language":"en"},

This study examined the combined use of an ELISA and Western blot (WB) to detect antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (N) of IBV. The coding sequence for N was amplified by RT-PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli. A soluble recombinant N protein (rN) of approximately 50 kDa was obtained. A total of 389 sera were tested against the rN in ELISA and the results were compared with those of the commercial IDEXX IBV Ab test. ELISA-rN achieved a 90.34% sensitivity and 90.16% specificity. WB confirmed all false negative sera in ELISA-rN or IDEXX test as truly positive. The current study indicate that the combined use of rN in ELISA and WB is a powerful tool for the immunodiagnosis of avian infectious bronchitis. METHODS: Constructed recombinant pAE/n expression vectors were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) Star competent cells (Invitrogen). The rN of infectious bronchitis virus was purified by affinity chromatography using HisTrap HP 1 mL columns pre-packed with pre-charged Ni Sepharose in the \u00C4KTAprime Automated Liquid Chromatography system (GE Healthcare). A total of 389 serum samples from chickens were used to develop and evaluate the ELISA-rN test. To standardize the indirect ELISA development, serum dilutions (1:100, 1:200 and 1:400) and different concentrations of purified rN antigen (50, 100 and 200 ng/well) were tested. Positive and negative sera for IBV were used as controls. The results were compared with those obtained from a commercial kit. Serum samples scored as negative with the commercial kit but as positive with the ELISA-rN were further analysed by Western blot analyses using the rN protein as an antigen. The results of the ELISA-rN were compared to the commercial kit results using receiver-operating characteristics curves, area under the curve, and confidence intervals with the software GraphPad Prism version 6.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, USA). RESULTS: The expected cDNA fragment of approximately 1240 bp was successfully amplified by PCR using primers designed to select for the coding region of the N protein. The rN was expressed as a soluble protein to avoid the refolding steps and, after purification a yield of 10 mg/L of rN was obtained. The SDS-PAGE results demonstrated the presence of two distinct bands that had a molecular mass of approximately 45 and 50 KDa. Out of 244 sera that scored positive in the commercial ELISA IDEXX IBV Ab Test, 220 were also positive in the ELISA-rN, yielding an ELISA-rN test sensitivity of 90.16%. Out of 145 sera that scored negative in the IDEXX IBV Ab Test, 131 also scored negative in the ELISA-rN, indicating a specificity of 90.34%. Sera that tested negative in the ELISA-rN and positive in the commercial test also reacted with the rN protein in Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: The association between the ELISA and Western blot techniques developed in this study with a subunit of IBV (rN) were able to detect antibodies that the commercial ELISA did not detect suggesting that the ELISA-rN has greater sensitivity.","publish_time":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Finger, Paula Fonseca; Pepe, Michele Soares; Dummer, Luana Alves; Magalh\u00E3es, Carolina Georg; de Castro, Clarissa Caetano; de Oliveira H\u00FCbner, Silvia; Leite, F\u00E1bio Pereira Leivas; Ritterbusch, Giseli Aparecida; Esteves, Paulo Augusto; Concei\u00E7\u00E3o, Fabricio Rochedo","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd99b86063184108e06b3b9c0595416888623cec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6292099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30541588/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-1096-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","Sera"],"organizations":["IBV","WB","HisTrap HP","GE Healthcare","USA","IDEXX IBV Ab Test"],"locations":["Escherichia"],"keyphrases":["rN protein","ELISA-rN test sensitivity","combined use of rN","commercial ELISA IDEXX IBV Ab Test","rN of infectious bronchitis virus","commercial test","indirect ELISA development","commercial IDEXX IBV Ab test","IDEXX test","commercial kit results","different concentrations of purified rN antigen","false negative sera","subunit of IBV","soluble protein","soluble recombinant N protein","nucleocapsid protein","Western blot techniques","Western blot analyses","WB","SDS-PAGE results","avian infectious bronchitis virus","serum samples","n expression vectors","immunodiagnosis of avian infectious bronchitis","GraphPad Software","antibodies","serum dilutions","current study","greater sensitivity","total","specificity","kDa","affinity chromatography","software GraphPad Prism version","recombinant pAE","coli BL21","Escherichia coli","RT-PCR","coding sequence","coding region","columns pre-packed","pre-charged Ni Sepharose","\u00C4KTAprime Automated Liquid Chromatography system","Windows","receiver-operating characteristics curves","area","DE3","confidence intervals","HisTrap HP","Star competent cells","poultry industry","GE Healthcare","powerful tool","significant source of loss","presence","distinct bands","refolding steps","early diagnosis","Invitrogen","bp","expected cDNA fragment","BACKGROUND","association","molecular mass","purification","USA","METHODS","chickens","yield","primers","CONCLUSIONS","controls","disease"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the identification of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China.

The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of novel coronaviruses and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Shum, Marcus Ho-Hin; Zhu, Hua-Chen; Tong, Yi-Gang; Ni, Xue-Bing; Liao, Yun-Shi; Wei, Wei; Cheung, William Yiu-Man; Li, Wen-Juan; Li, Lian-Feng; Leung, Gabriel M; Holmes, Edward C; Hu, Yan-Ling; Guan, Yi","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32218527/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2169-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","identification of SARS","related coronaviruses","sub-lineages of SARS","pangolin-associated coronaviruses","emergence of novel coronaviruses","southern China","discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus","possible hosts","Malayan pangolins","strong similarity","zoonotic transmission","likely reservoir hosts","source of zoonotic infection2","ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia","Manis javanica","anti-smuggling operations","transfer","sale of wild animals","Wuhan","bats","Metagenomic sequencing","wet markets","intermediate host","seafood market","identity","receptor-binding domain","humans"],"language":"en"},

The main aim was to develop a reproducible model to study the pathogenesis of PRRSV-induced multifactorial respiratory disease. The central hypothesis was that respiratory disease results from an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. In a first series of studies, PRRSV was shown to be a poor inducer of TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B1 in the lungs, whereas IL-1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were produced consistently during infection. We then set up a dual inoculation model in which pigs were inoculated intratracheally with PRRSV and 3\u201314 days later with LPS. PRRSV-infected pigs developed acute respiratory signs for 12\u201324h upon intratracheal LPS inoculation, in contrast to pigs inoculated with PRRSV or LPS only. Moreover, peak TNF-\u03B1, IL-1 and IL-6 titers were 10\u2013100 times higher in PRRSV\u2013LPS inoculated pigs than in the singly inoculated pigs and the cytokine overproduction was associated with disease. To further prove the role of proinflammatory cytokines, we studied the effect of pentoxifylline, a known inhibitor of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-1, on PRRSV\u2013LPS induced cytokine production and disease. The clinical effects of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), meloxicam and flunixin meglumine, were also examined. Pentoxifylline, but not the NSAIDs, significantly reduced fever and respiratory signs from 2 to 6h after LPS. The levels of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-1 in the lungs of pentoxifylline-treated pigs were moderately reduced, but were still 26 and 3.5-fold higher than in pigs inoculated with PRRSV or LPS only. This indicates that pathways other than inhibition of cytokine production contributed to the clinical improvement. Finally, we studied a mechanism by which PRRSV may sensitize the lungs for LPS. We hypothesized that PRRSV would increase the amount of LPS receptor complex in the lungs leading to LPS sensitisation. Both CD14 and LPS-binding protein, two components of this complex, increased significantly during infection and the amount of CD14 in particular was correlated with LPS sensitisation. The increase of CD14 was mainly due to infiltration of strongly CD14-positive monocytes in the lungs. The PRRSV\u2013LPS combination proved to be a simple and reproducible experimental model for multifactorial respiratory disease in pigs. To what extent the interaction between PRRSV and LPS contributes to the development of complex respiratory disease is still a matter of debate.","publish_time":"2004-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Gucht, Steven; Labarque, Geoffrey; Van Reeth, Kristien","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20738b294973fa633e5c597a5f8ae426ca673ab9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112634.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704002375; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704002375","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LPS inoculated pigs","LPS sensitisation","LPS combination","PRRSV-infected pigs","pathogenesis of PRRSV","LPS receptor complex","intratracheal LPS inoculation","LPS induced cytokine production","LPS-binding protein","multifactorial respiratory disease","respiratory disease results","treated pigs","lungs of pentoxifylline","development of complex respiratory disease","anti-inflammatory cytokine IL","acute respiratory signs","peak TNF-\u03B1","respiratory syndrome virus","cytokine overproduction","IFN-\u03B1","increase of CD14","reproducible model","levels of TNF","inhibition of cytokine production","NSAIDs","interaction","reproducible experimental model","known inhibitor of TNF","overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines","dual inoculation model","poor inducer of TNF","CD14-positive monocytes","effect of pentoxifylline","infection","role of proinflammatory cytokines","times higher","clinical effects","clinical improvement","series of studies","reduced fever","non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","meloxicam","contrast","infiltration","components","central hypothesis","flunixin meglumine","paper reviews","pathways","titers","matter of debate","extent","main aim","authors\u2019 laboratory","days","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Wet disinfection has been found to be the most effective decontamination of feed mill surfaces; however, this is not practical on a commercial feed production scale. Another potential mitigation strategy would be using chemically treated rice hulls flushed through the feed manufacturing equipment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) or formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush batches as potential chemical mitigation strategies for PEDV during feed manufacturing. Feed without evidence of PEDV RNA contamination was inoculated with PEDV. Based on polymerase chain reaction analysis, this feed had a cycle threshold (Ct) = 30.2 and was confirmed infective in bioassay. After manufacturing the PEDV-positive feed, untreated rice hulls, formaldehyde-treated rice hulls, 2% MCFA- (a 1:1:1 blend of hexanoic, octanoic, and decanoic acid) treated rice hulls, or 10% MCFA-treated rice hulls were flushed through laboratory scale mixers. For the untreated rice hulls, 3 of 6 samples had detectable PEDV RNA, whereas 1 of 6 formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush samples and 2 of 6 of the 2% MCFA rice hull flush samples had detectable PEDV RNA. However, PEDV RNA was not detected in any of the 10% MCFA rice hull flush samples. Then, rice hulls treated with 10% MCFA were mixed and discharged through a production scale mixer and bucket elevator following PEDV-positive feed. No rice hull flush or feed samples from the mixer following chemically treated rice hull flush had detectible PEDV RNA. However, one 10% MCFA rice hull sample collected from the bucket elevator discharge spout had detectible PEDV RNA. Dust collected following mixing of PEDV contaminated feed had detectable PEDV RNA (Ct = 29.4) and was infectious. However, dust collected immediately after the 10% MCFA rice hull flush batch had a reduced quantity of PEDV RNA (Ct = 33.7) and did not cause infection. Overall, the use of rice hull flushes effectively reduced the quantity of detectible RNA present after mixing a batch of PEDV-positive feed. Chemical treatment of rice hulls with formaldehyde or 10% MCFA provided additional reduction in detectible RNA. Finally, dust collected after manufacturing PEDV-inoculated feed has the potential to serve as a vector for PEDV transmission.","publish_time":"2018-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gebhardt, Jordan T; Cochrane, Roger A; Woodworth, Jason C; Jones, Cassandra K; Niederwerder, Megan C; Muckey, Mary B; Stark, Charles R; Tokach, Mike D; DeRouchey, Joel M; Goodband, Robert D; Bai, Jianfa; Gauger, Philip C; Chen, Qi; Zhang, Jianqiang; Main, Rodger G; Dritz, Steve S","journal":"Journal of Animal Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92e105b281fafeb58c5fa27a6a1aade2f93986ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6162582.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/sky295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30052979/; https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/96/10/4149/25863318/sky295.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV-positive feed","MCFA-treated rice hulls","detectible PEDV RNA","detectable PEDV RNA","batch of PEDV","feed samples","PEDV transmission","MCFA rice hull flush samples","formaldehyde-treated rice hulls","manufacturing PEDV-inoculated feed","MCFA rice hull sample","untreated rice hulls","MCFA rice hull flush batch","formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush samples","reduced quantity of PEDV RNA","formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush batches","feed ingredients","following mixing of PEDV contaminated feed","evidence of PEDV RNA contamination","use of rice hull flushes","Chemical treatment of rice hulls","feed manufacturing equipment","effective decontamination of feed","commercial feed production scale","quantity of detectible RNA present","Dust","potential chemical mitigation strategies","potential mitigation strategy","production scale mixer","laboratory scale mixers","bucket elevator discharge spout","potential risk of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","Various strategies","chain fatty acids","polymerase chain reaction analysis","effects of medium","decanoic acid","additional reduction","octanoic","cycle threshold","blend of hexanoic","surfaces","vector","study","Wet disinfection","bioassay","objective"],"language":"en"},

With the recent emergence of novel virulent strains, these viruses can have a large impact on human and animal health. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is considered to be a reemerging pig disease caused by the enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus PED virus (PEDV). In the absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine are critical. Early detection and differential diagnosis of PEDV infections increase the chance of successful control of the disease. Therefore, there is a continuous need for development of reduced assay-step protocols, no-wash, high-throughput immunoassays. This study described the characterization of the humoral immune response against PEDV under experimental and field conditions using a rapid, sensitive, luminescent proximity homogenous assay (AlphaLISA). PEDV IgG and IgA antibodies were developed toward the beginning of the second week of infection. PEDV IgG antibodies were detected for at least 16 weeks post-exposure. Remarkably, the serum IgA levels remained high and relatively stable throughout the study, lasting longer than the serum IgG response. Overall, AlphaLISA allows the detection and characterization of pathogen-specific antibodies with new speed, sensitivity, and simplicity of use.

This phenomenon is particularly challenging for immunocompromised individuals, such as those who have undergone bone marrow transplant (BMT), because they are more likely to display worse clinical outcomes to influenza infection than non-immunocompromised individuals. We studied the clinical and viral aspects of post-BMT patients with confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 diagnosis in the largest cancer hospital in Brazil. We found a viral strain with K-15E, P83S and Q293H polymorphisms in the HA, which is presumably more virulent, in these individuals. Despite that, these patients showed only mild symptoms of infection. Our findings complement the discovery of mild cases of infection with the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with the K-15E, P83S and Q293H mutations in Brazil and oppose other studies that have linked these changes with increased disease severity.

Engineering of genetically defined live attenuated vaccines is a rational approach for novel vaccine development. In this line, we engineered an attenuated virus based on the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome, expressing a chimeric spike protein from a virulent United States (US) PEDV strain. This virus (rTGEV-RS-SPEDV) was attenuated in highly-sensitive five-day-old piglets, as infected animals did not lose weight and none of them died. In addition, the virus caused very minor tissue damage compared with a virulent virus. The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV vaccine candidate was also attenuated in three-week-old animals that were used to evaluate the protection conferred by this virus, compared with the protection induced by infection with a virulent PEDV US strain (PEDV-NVSL). The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus protected against challenge with a virulent PEDV strain, reducing challenge virus titers in jejunum and leading to undetectable challenge virus RNA levels in feces. The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus induced a humoral immune response specific for PEDV, including neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, the data indicated that rTGEV-RS-SPEDV is a promising vaccine candidate against virulent PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2019-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pascual-Iglesias, Alejandro; Sanchez, Carlos M.; Penzes, Zoltan; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis; Zu\u00F1iga, Sonia","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22b6982820cdeb330dc2086ea69713f6e109a671.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6723174.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11080682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31349683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["virulent virus","SPEDV virus","attenuated virus","virulent PEDV strain","virulent PEDV infection","challenge virus titers","rTGEV-RS","virulent PEDV US strain","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","PEDV-NVSL","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","virulent strains","undetectable challenge virus RNA levels","SPEDV vaccine candidate","defined live attenuated vaccines","virulent United States","promising vaccine candidate","protection","novel vaccine development","need of effective vaccines","week-old animals","porcine herds","infected animals","day-old piglets","rational approach","genome","humoral immune response specific","high morbidity","mortality","chimeric spike protein","jejunum","vaccinated farms","enteric coronavirus","recurrent outbreaks","feces","minor tissue damage","Engineering","neutralizing antibodies","weight","emergence","addition","data","line"],"language":"en"},

Thus, we maintain the quarantined essentially as for as others saved from COVID-19. So far, the routine laboratory test to confirm whether infected by SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV or not is through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR; quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]) with certain sequence regions that recognize SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV RNA genome.

In cases of infectious disease outbreak, forecasting models are often developed for resources utilization. Pregnancy and delivery pose unique challenges, given the altered maternal immune system and the fact that the majority of American women choose to deliver in the hospital setting. Objectives The aim of our study is to forecast the incidence of COVID-19 in general population and to forecast the overall incidence, severe cases, critical cases and fatal COVID-19 cases during delivery hospitalization in the United States. Study design We use a phenomenological model with generalized logistic growth models to forecast the incidence of COVID-19 in the United States from 4/15/2020 \u2013 12/31/2020. Incidence data from 3/1/2020 \u2013 4/14/2020 were used to provide best-fit model solution. Subsequently, Monte-Carlo simulation was performed for each week from 3/1/2020 \u2013 12/31/2020 to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in delivery hospitalizations using the available data estimate. Results From 3/1/2020 \u2013 12/31/2020, our model forecasted a total of 860,475 cases of COVID-19 in general population across the United States. The cumulative incidence for COVID-19 during delivery hospitalization is anticipated to be 16,601 (95% CI, 9,711 \u2013 23,491) cases. Among those, 3,308 (95% CI, 1,755 \u2013 4,861) cases are expected to be severe, 681 (95% CI, 1324 \u2013 1,038) critical and 52 (95% CI, 23 \u2013 81) maternal mortality. Assuming similar baseline maternal mortality rate as the year of 2018, we projected an increase in maternal mortality rate in the US to at least 18.7 (95% CI, 18.0 \u2013 19.5) deaths per 100,000 live birth as a direct result of COVID-19. Conclusions COVID-19 infection in pregnant women is expected to severely impact obstetrical care. From 3/1/2020 \u2013 12/31/2020, we project 3,308 severe and 681 critical cases, with about 52 COVID-19 related maternal mortalities during delivery hospitalization in the United States.

In spite of its limited efficacy and potential side effects, Ribavirin is extensively used as a first choice against HCoVs. Therefore, scientists reverted towards the investigation of different drugs that can more specifically target proteins. In this study, four anti\u2010HCV drugs (one approved by FDA and others under clinical trials) are tested against HCoV polymerases. Quantitative Structure\u2010Activity Relationship (QSAR) and molecular docking are both used to compare the performance of the selected nucleotide inhibitors to their parent nucleotides and Ribavirin. Both QSAR and molecular docking showed that IDX\u2010184 is superior compared to Ribavirin against MERS CoV, a result that was also reported for HCV. MK\u20100608 showed a performance that is comparable to Ribavirin.

In everyday clinical practice, it is helpful to know the relevance and characteristics of these pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To present the epidemiology, clinical picture and differences of human pathogenic CoV and to provide information on the diagnostics and treatment of patients suspected of having CoV infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Selective literature search, presentation of results and discussion of fundamental works and expert recommendations, including publications by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Robert Koch Institute. RESULTS: The four endemic human CoVs (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) mainly cause mild respiratory tract infections. In addition to these four endemic HCoV, the two epidemic CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV can cause severe pneumonia. The SARS-CoV has not been detected in humans in the last 15 years and MERS-CoV has been circulating mainly on the Arabian Peninsula since 2012; however, neither a specific treatment nor approved vaccines exist for any of the six human pathogenic CoVs. CONCLUSION: All six human CoVs can be diagnosed using RT-PCR on respiratory specimens but this is rarely necessary for the four endemic strains. In current clinical practice SARS-CoV has no importance as it has not been detected in humans for 15 years; however, a possible MERS-CoV infection should be taken into account in patients with typical symptoms and travel history to endemic regions. In this case, rapid diagnostic and general hygiene practices are important to prevent further transmission.","publish_time":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corman, V.

In order to better understand this disease and its etiology, we collected case and control samples and performed pathological and diagnostic analyses. Electron micrographs revealed filamentous virus-like particles in lung epithelial cells of sick animals. Diagnostic testing for known pathogens did not identify an etiologic agent, so unbiased metagenomic sequencing was performed. Abundant nidovirus-like sequences were identified in cases and were used to assemble the genome of a previously unknown virus in the order Nidovirales. The nidoviruses, which were not previously known to infect nonavian reptiles, are a diverse order that includes important human and veterinary pathogens. The presence of the viral RNA was confirmed in all diseased animals (n = 8) but was not detected in healthy pythons or other snakes (n = 57). Viral RNA levels were generally highest in the lung and other respiratory tract tissues. The 33.5-kb viral genome is the largest RNA genome yet described and shares canonical characteristics with other nidovirus genomes, although several features distinguish this from related viruses. This virus, which we named ball python nidovirus (BPNV), will likely establish a new genus in Torovirinae subfamily. The identification of a novel nidovirus in reptiles contributes to our understanding of the biology and evolution of related viruses, and its association with lung disease in pythons is a promising step toward elucidating an etiology for this long-standing veterinary disease.","publish_time":"2014-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stenglein, Mark D.; Jacobson, Elliott R.; Wozniak, Edward J.; Wellehan, James F.

Characterization of the different passages revealed that compared with P10 and P64, P120 had a higher viral titer and more obvious cytopathic effects, thereby demonstrating better cell adaptability. RESULTS: Pathogenicity experiments using P120 in piglets revealed significant reductions in clinical symptoms, histopathological lesions, and intestinal PEDV antigen distribution; the piglet survival rate in the P120 group was 100%. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing identified 13 amino acid changes in P120, which might be responsible for the attenuated virulence of P120. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, an attenuated strain was obtained via cell passaging and that this strain could be used in preparing attenuated vaccines.","publish_time":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Yu; Li, Wei; Zhou, Qingfeng; Li, Qunhui; Xu, Zhichao; Shen, Hanqin; Chen, Feng","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40f5b6b40883f3fa9265a45ac3b5b8150268ed9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6819350.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660993/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1232-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["P120 group","attenuated virulence of P120","attenuated strain","PEDV variant strains","available PEDV vaccine strains","attenuated vaccines","virulent epidemic virus strain CT","intestinal PEDV antigen distribution","protective effects","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","cell passaging","obvious cytopathic effects","better cell adaptability","histopathological lesions","piglets","significant reductions","piglet survival rate","clinical symptoms","higher viral titer","enormous economic losses","amino acid changes","global pig industry","Pathogenicity experiments","genome sequencing","study","BACKGROUND","P10","P64","Vero cells","different passages","generations","RESULTS","Characterization","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to investigate associations between DPP-4 inhibitors and risk of autoimmune disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Taiwan. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the nationwide data from the diabetes subsection of Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were developed to compare the risk of autoimmune disorders and the subgroup analyses between the DPP-4i and DPP-4i-na\u00EFve groups. RESULTS: A total of 774,198 type 2 diabetic patients were identified. The adjusted HR of the incidence for composite autoimmune disorders in DPP-4i group was 0.56 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.60; P \u003C 0.001). The subgroup analysis demonstrated that the younger patients (aged 20\u201340 years: HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35\u20130.61; aged 41\u201360 years: HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.46\u20130.55; aged 61\u201380 years: HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.58\u20130.68, P = 0.0004) and the lesser duration of diabetes diagnosed (0\u20135 years: HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.44\u20130.52; 6\u201310 years: HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.43\u20130.53; \u2267 10 years: HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78\u20130.96, P \u003C 0.0001), the more significant the inverse association of DPP-4 inhibitors with the incidence of composite autoimmune diseases. CONCLUSIONS: DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with lower risk of autoimmune disorders in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Taiwan, especially for the younger patients and the lesser duration of diabetes diagnosed. The significant difference was found between the four types of DPP-4 inhibitors and the risk of autoimmune diseases. This study provides clinicians with useful information regarding the use of DPP-4 inhibitors for treating diabetic patients.

The objective of this study was to determine if feed batch sequencing methods could minimize PEDV cross-contamination. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-free swine feed was manufactured to represent the negative control. A 50 kg feed batch was mixed in a pilot scale feed mill for 5 min, sampled, then discharged for 10 min into a bucket elevator and sampled again upon exit. Next, a pathogenic PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 49.5 kg of PEDV-free feed to form the positive control. The positive control was mixed, conveyed and sampled similar to the negative control. Subsequently, 4 sequence batches (sequence 1 to 4) were formed by adding a 50 kg batch of PEDV-negative feed to the mixer after the prior batch was mixed and conveyed; all sequences were mixed, conveyed, and sampled similar to the negative and positive control batches. None of the equipment was cleaned between batches within a replicate. This entire process was replicated 3 times with cleaning the feed mill between replicates. Feed was then analyzed for PEDV RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) and for infectivity by bioassay. Sequence 1 feed had higher (P \u02C2 0.05) rRT-PCR Ct values than the positive batch and sequence 2 feed had higher (P \u02C2 0.05) Ct values than sequence 1, regardless of sampled location. Feed sampled from the mixer from sequence 2, 3, and 4 was rRT-PCR negative whereas feed sampled from the bucket elevator was rRT-PCR negative from sequence 3 and 4. Bioassay was conducted using 66 mixed sex 10-d-old pigs confirmed negative for PEDV allocated to 22 different rooms. Pigs were initially 10-d old. Control pigs remained PEDV negative for the study. All pigs from the mixer positive batch (9/9) and bucket elevator positive batch (3/3) were rRT-PCR positive on fecal swabs by the end of the study. One replicate of pigs from mixer sequence 1 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi. One replicate of mixer pigs from sequence 2 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi although no detectable PEDV RNA was found in the feed. The results demonstrate sequenced batches had reduced quantities of PEDV RNA although sequenced feed without detectible PEDV RNA by rRT-PCR can be infectious. Therefore, a sequencing protocol can reduce but not eliminate the risk of producing infectious PEDV carryover from the first sequenced batch of feed.","publish_time":"2018-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schumacher, Loni L; Cochrane, Roger A; Huss, Anne R; Gebhardt, Jordan T; Woodworth, Jason C; Stark, Charles R; Jones, Cassandra K; Bai, Jianfa; Main, Rodger G; Chen, Qi; Zhang, Jianqiang; Gauger, Philip C; DeRouchey, Joel M; Goodband, Robert D; Tokach, Mike D; Dritz, Steve S","journal":"Journal of Animal Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6597f5e22e2d2abb997d85cdca13e656aa30372.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6247855.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30099515/; https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/96/11/4562/26675002/sky320.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/sky320","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["negative feed","batch of PEDV","PEDV negative","PEDV-free feed","sequenced feed","sequenced batch of feed","rRT-PCR positive","rRT-PCR negative","mixer positive batch","mixer sequence","negative control","feed batch sequencing methods","sequence batches","positive control batches","pilot scale feed","Control pigs","bucket elevator positive batch","detectible PEDV RNA","quantities of PEDV RNA","detectable PEDV RNA","rRT-PCR Ct values","infectious PEDV carryover","PEDV cross-contamination","pathogenic PEDV isolate","replicate of mixer pigs","prior batch","replicate of pigs","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-free swine feed","sampled location","sequenced batches","d-old pigs","study","mixed sex","d old","bioassay","sequencing protocol","real-time reverse transcriptase semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction","fecal swabs","vector of transmission","times","cleaning","end","cycle threshold","infectivity","results","risk","entire process","different rooms","exit","replicates","objective","equipment","sequences"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to review and synthesise learning from previous literature focused on the impact on grief and bereavement during other infectious disease outbreaks.

From the 218 identified papers, 6 were included in the analysis. They were four qualitative studies, one observational study and a systematic review. Studies were conducted in West Africa, Haiti and Singapore. No research studies have focused on outcomes and support for bereaved people during a pandemic. Studies have tended to focus on survivors i.e. those who had the illness and recovered, recognising that some of these individuals will also be bereaved people. Previous pandemics appear to cause multiple losses both directly related to death itself but also in terms of disruption to social norms, rituals and mourning practices. This affects the ability for an individual to connect with the deceased both before and after the death, potentially increasing the risk of complicated grief. In view of the limited research, specific learning from the current COVID-19 crisis and the impact on the bereaved would be pertinent. Current focus should include innovative ways to promote connection and adapt rituals while maintaining respect. Strong leadership and coordination between different bereavement organisations is essential to providing successful post-bereavement support.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mayland, Catriona R.; Harding, Andrew JE.; Preston, Nancy; Payne, Sheila","journal":"Journal of pain and symptom management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ad706f7e13ae4379a25f56d20fb09b1ff0ee239.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420303882?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392420303882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416233/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.05.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["qualitative studies","research studies","bereaved people","different bereavement organisations","successful post-bereavement support","major impact","rituals","current COVID","experience of death","Current focus","systematic review","rapid scoping review","specific learning","limited research","global COVID","observational study","previous literature","Previous pandemics","analysed qualitative data","risk of complicated grief","Joanna Briggs Institute","social norms","principles","coordination","outcomes","thematic synthesis","Strong leadership","innovative ways","connection","mourning practices","terms of disruption","West Africa","multiple losses","crisis","infectious disease outbreaks","Haiti","Singapore","respect","deceased","survivors","individuals","identified papers","ability","illness","analysis"],"language":"en"},

The proposed method correctly differentiated direct and indirect exposure for 120 out of the 133 mixing ventilation cases and 47 out of the 58 displacement ventilation cases. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for use at the early design stage to quickly assess whether there will be direct exposure to exhaled contaminants in a mechanically ventilated room.","publish_time":"2018-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chun; Zhao, Bin; Lai, Dayi; Liu, Wei","journal":"Build Simul","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf745b863950e6831d0cfaac1cae3b1f8bcdeb9d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12273-018-0441-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32218904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Indirect exposure","exhaled contaminants","proposed method","simple method","exhaled jet","target person","displacement ventilated rooms","mixing ventilation cases","displacement ventilation cases","infected person","Experimental data","use","breathing zone","early design stage","airborne infectious diseases","paper","literature"],"language":"en"},

Viruses contribute to 30\u201370% of acute respiratory infections. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority except influenza; however, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value. METHODS: As a part of National Influenza-like illness surveillance programme, respiratory specimens were collected children and adults with symptoms of ILI or ARI, between January 2012 and March 2015 (including SARI cases). Real-time PCR was done to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer. RESULTS: During the study period between January 2012 and March 2015, a total of 648 patients with symptoms of ARI were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 20.2 years (SD = 19.13, median = 18); 292 (45.1%) were children (\u226413 years) and 356 (54.9%) were adults. Respiratory viruses were identified in 44% (287/648) of all patients. Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179/648 (27.6%). Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated with 34 cases (5.2%), followed by HMPV 24 (3.7%) and PIV-3 20 (3%). Four patients died due to INF A/H1N1 as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (CFR 3.7%). Among the non-influenza viruses, no particular seasonality pattern was observed over the different months of the study period. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic usage in treating acute respiratory infections empirically is not justified as nearly half of ARI are due to viruses; nearly 28% of them were due to influenza viruses. Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults. Such surveillance network has paved the way for better diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palani, Nandhini; Sistla, Sujatha","journal":"Clin Epidemiol Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0021fca0e1b1795ab1e6fe61fc16d185d24137d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187823.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346655/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2020.04.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398420301159?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213398420301159","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","ARI","RSV","HMPV"],"locations":["Puducherry"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","prevalence of non-influenza viruses","National Influenza","burden of influenza","active influenza surveillance","Acute respiratory infections","pandemic influenza outbreak","respiratory specimens","patients","result of acute respiratory distress syndrome","children","symptoms of ARI","adults","study period","surveillance network","RSV","knowledge","years","SARI cases","HMPV","illness surveillance programme","maximum number of cases","seasonal pattern","genetic evolution","Genetic Analyzer","symptoms of ILI","particular seasonality pattern","way","better diagnosis","ABI","significant epidemiological value","ARDS","Antibiotic usage","timely therapeutic interventions","different months","representative isolates","common illnesses","H1N1","BACKGROUND","high priority","Union territory of Puducherry","people","ages","CFR","CONCLUSION","SD","mean age","Sequencing","RESULTS","total","Identification","Real-time PCR","METHODS","PIV"],"language":"en"},

Here we identify a lncRNA as a key regulator of antiviral innate immunity. Following from the observation that a lncRNA that we call negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) was dramatically downregulated during infection with several viruses, we ectopically expressed NRAV in human cells or transgenic mice and found that it significantly promotes influenza A virus (IAV) replication and virulence. Conversely, silencing NRAV suppressed IAV replication and virus production, suggesting that reduction of NRAV is part of the host antiviral innate immune response to virus infection. NRAV negatively regulates the initial transcription of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM3 and MxA, by affecting histone modification of these genes. Our results provide evidence for a lncRNA in modulating the antiviral interferon response.","publish_time":"2014-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ouyang, Jing; Zhu, Xiaomei; Chen, Yuhai; Wei, Haitao; Chen, Qinghuang; Chi, Xiaojuan; Qi, Baomin; Zhang, Lianfeng; Zhao, Yi; Gao, George Fu; Wang, Guoshun; Chen, Ji-Long","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/782e07fd19eca7250b9f332a9b6021c3185c583b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bbcf2f178b4a1f7448e767d4d4bf0b169800e723.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f98995d6406fed1008489aa5c74fe6cafc9efd49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104942.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2014.10.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312814003795; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312814003795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25525793/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NRAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral interferon response","silencing NRAV","reduction of NRAV","negative regulator of antiviral response","host antiviral responses","virus infection","key regulator of antiviral innate immunity","virus production","IAV replication","immune response","initial transcription of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes","ISGs","role","various biological processes","lncRNAs","MxA","IFITM3","human cells","transgenic mice","noncoding RNAs","histone modification","influenza","virulence","results","evidence","viruses","observation"],"language":"en"},

Infections can lead to skin eruptions and mimic drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR), if a drug is taken at the same time. The most of children are labeled as \u2018drug allergic\u2019 after considering only the clinical history. OBJECTIVE: To diagnose/detect a hypersensitivity or an infection which mimic DHR in children with non\u2010immediate reactions to BL METHODS: A prospective survey was conducted in a group of 1026 children with histories of non\u2010immediate reactions to BL by performing patch tests, skin tests, and in case of negative results, drug provocation tests (DPTs). In 300 children, a study was performed to detect infections by viruses or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. RESULTS: Urticaria and maculopapular exanthemas were the most reported non\u2010immediate reactions. Only 76 (7.4%) of 1026 children had confirmed non\u2010immediate hypersensitivity reactions to BL. Fifty\u2010seven children had positive delayed\u2010reading intradermal tests (18 of these with a positive patch test). Nineteen children had positive DPT. Sixty\u2010six of 300 children had positive tests for viruses or Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 2 of them had a positive allergy work\u2010up. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnostic work\u2010up should be performed in all children with non\u2010immediate reactions to BL, to remove a false label of hypersensitivity. Even though only 57 (5.5%) of 1026 children displayed positive responses to delayed\u2010reading intradermal tests to BL, such tests appear to be useful in order to reduce the risk for positive DPTs.","publish_time":"2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Atanaskovic\u2010Markovic, Marina; Gaeta, Francesco; Medjo, Biljana; Gavrovic\u2010Jankulovic, Marija; Cirkovic Velickovic, Tanja; Tmusic, Vladimir; Romano, Antonino","journal":"Pediatr Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58f363ec7abb8095c0defc4ad168bda3cedba6c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167905.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.12565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26999792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DPT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","positive tests","non\u2010immediate hypersensitivity reactions","histories of non\u2010immediate reactions","reported non\u2010immediate reactions","skin tests","intradermal tests","patch tests","mimic drug hypersensitivity reactions","positive DPTs","drug provocation tests","positive responses","positive patch test","positive allergy work","BL METHODS","drug administration","drug allergic","DHR","maculopapular exanthemas","viruses","false label of hypersensitivity","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Infections","urticaria","skin eruptions","diagnostic work","case of negative results","beta","lactam antibiotics","common manifestations","prospective survey","group","risk","order","BACKGROUND","hour","CONCLUSIONS","study","clinical history","angioedema","time","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

We describe here three novel RNA viruses that we identified in oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs collected from wild birds. The complete genome of a novel gull metapneumovirus (GuMPV B29) was determined. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that this virus could represent a novel avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) sub-group, intermediate between AMPV-C and the subgroup of the other AMPVs. This virus was detected in an American herring (1/24, 4.2%) and great black-backed (4/26, 15.4%) gulls. A novel gull coronavirus (GuCoV B29) was detected in great black-backed (3/26, 11.5%) and American herring (2/24, 8.3%) gulls. Phylogenetic analyses of GuCoV B29 suggested that this virus could represent a novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, close to other recently identified potential novel avian coronaviral species. One GuMPV\u2013GuCoV co-infection was detected. A novel duck calicivirus (DuCV-2 B6) was identified in mallards (2/5, 40%) and American black ducks (7/26, 26.9%). This virus, of which we identified two different types, was fully sequenced and was genetically closest to other caliciviruses identified in Anatidae, but more distant to other caliciviruses from birds in the genus Anas. These discoveries increase our knowledge about avian virus diversity and host distributions.","publish_time":"2019-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Canuti, Marta; Kroyer, Ashley N.

A consumer survey was conducted in Hohhot, China in September 2009, one year after the melamine contamination of milk was disclosed to the public. Households with young children who were not being breast-fed reported that they had reduced milk consumption by at least 1/3 in the immediate aftermath of the melamine disclosure and 39% reported that they cut out milk consumption altogether. A significantly higher percentage of households with children reported being concerned with the effects of melamine in milk and two communicable diseases: SARS and H1N1 influenza than were those with no children. A significantly higher percentage of households with no young children were concerned with the effects of Trace Sudan in chicken, Clenbuterol in pork, chicken eggs with red yolks, and excess iodine in milk powder than were those with young children. All households that reduced consumption of fluid milk following news of the melamine contamination reported a much greater concern with most food safety and health scares than did households that did not reduce consumption of fluid milk. Survey data revealed that most consumers had a relatively low level of knowledge of the Food Safety Law that went into effect just over three months before this survey was conducted. Households with children also were significantly more concerned about melamine and two communicable diseases, SARS and H1N1 than were households without children.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiao, Guanghua; Guo, Ting; Klein, K.

This balance is crucial in core functional organs, such as the central nervous system (CNS), where minor changes in neuronal microenvironments and the production of immune factors can result in significant disease with fatal consequences or permanent neurological sequelae. Viral encephalitis and multiple sclerosis are examples of important human diseases in which the pathogenic contribution of monocytes recruited from the bone marrow plays a critical role in the clinical expression of disease, as they differentiate into macrophage or dendritic cells in the CNS to carry out effector functions. While antigen-specific lymphocyte populations are central to the adaptive immune response in both cases, in viral encephalitis a prominent macrophage infiltration may mediate immunopathological damage, seizure induction, and death. However, the autoimmune response to non-replicating, non-infectious, but abundant, self antigen has a different disease progression, associated with differentiation of significant numbers of infiltrating monocytes into dendritic cells in the CNS. Whilst a predominant presence of macrophages or dendritic cells in the inflamed CNS in viral encephalitis or multiple sclerosis is well described, the way in which the inflamed CNS mobilizes monocytes in the bone marrow to migrate to the CNS and the key drivers that lead to these specific differentiation pathways in vivo are not well understood. Here we review the current understanding of factors facilitating inflammatory monocyte generation, migration and entry into the brain, as well as their differentiation towards macrophages or dendritic cells in viral and autoimmune disease in relation to their respective disease outcomes.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ashhurst, Thomas Myles; Vreden, Caryn van; Niewold, Paula; King, Nicholas Jonathan Cole","journal":"Cellular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0babc8288cb5191ee7a1bf37511b415add1cc682.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094263.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008874914001117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086710/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2014.07.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0008874914001117","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significant disease","autoimmune disease","dendritic cells","inflamed CNS","Viral encephalitis","different disease progression","clinical expression of disease","respective disease outcomes","pathogenic contribution of monocytes","differentiation of significant numbers of infiltrating monocytes","multiple sclerosis","autoimmune response","bone marrow","specific differentiation pathways","production of immune factors","adaptive immune response","self antigen","pathogenic roles","antigen-specific lymphocyte populations","prominent macrophage infiltration","current understanding of factors","central nervous system","predominant presence of macrophages","inflammatory monocyte generation","immunopathological damage","examples of important human diseases","foreign stimuli","migration","fatal consequences","cases","relation","neuronal microenvironments","critical role","entry","core functional organs","permanent neurological sequelae","non-replicating","minor changes","seizure induction","balance","stereotypic responses","key drivers","death","brain","immunity","decades","effector functions","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

This study is designed to enhance understanding by assessing a sample U.S EMS providers\u2019 views about working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks and explores whether they are coming to work during such conditions. METHODS: This study utilized a qualitative approach using face-to-face interviews with EMS workers from the State of Delaware, USA. Participants were asked about their views, insights, and potential behavior of working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks. Data collected were transcribed and coded using ATLAS.ti software to develop themes of the study using an inductive approach. RESULTS: Three themes were emerged from interviews regarding working during natural disasters; respondents expressed excitement, concern, or no real differences. For disease outbreaks, however, the two themes were concerned and no additional risk. While participants expressed varying concerns about working during disasters and pandemic conditions, everyone felt willing and obligated to come to work despite the perceived high risk for some of them to work in some conditions. CONCLUSION: This study helps to provide the base upon which EMS, public health, and emergency management agencies can formulate actions that emerged from the views of EMS providers concerning work during disasters and public health emergencies.","publish_time":"2019-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alwidyan, Mahmoud T.; Trainor, Joseph E.; Bissell, Richard A.","journal":"Int J Disaster Risk Reduct","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c59be4a315ea75ba6f96045352a4ad746a0fa2fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185370.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363141/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420919312646; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420919312646","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health emergencies","study","working","huge burden of natural disasters","views of EMS providers","themes","disease outbreaks","EMS workers","S EMS providers\u2019 views","pandemic conditions","Participants","face-to-face interviews","qualitative approach","Emergency medical service providers","inductive approach","additional risk","emergency management agencies","perceived high risk","sample U","excitement","potential behavior","respondents","performance","State of Delaware","actions","roles","base","ti software","varying concerns","planet","ATLAS","insights","understanding","real differences","USA","METHODS","decades","system","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","frontlines","Data"],"language":"en"},

The key mechanism of ALI/ARDS is that the excessive inflammatory response damages the integrity of alveolar and bronchial cell membrane and thus affects their basic function. Phospholipids are the main component of cell membranes. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which catalyzes the cleavage of membrane phospholipids, is the most important inflammatory mediator of ALI. However, clara cell secretory protein 1 (CCSP1), an endogenous PLA2 inhibitor can increase the self-defense of membrane phospholipids. Thus, CCSP1 up-regulation and PLA2 inhibition constitutes an effective method for ensuring the stability of membrane phospholipids and for the treatment of ALI/ARDS. In the present study, we developed an in vitro model of ALI via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of a human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, and assessed the mRNA and protein levels of CCSP1 and PLA2 in the model cells. The results demonstrated LPS induction inhibited the transcription and protein expression of CCSP1, but only the protein level of membrane associated PLA2 was increased, suggesting that in the in vitro ALI model, abnormally regulated CCSP1 transcription plays a crucial role in the damage of cell membrane. To find out the reason that CCSP1 expression was decreased in the ALI model, we predicted, by means of bioinformatics, putative transcription factors which would bind to CCSP1 promoter, examined their background and expression, and found that a transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03B2 (C/EBP \u03B2), was correlated with the transcription of CCSP1 in the in vitro ALI model, and its phosphorylation in the model was decreased. CHIP-PCR and luciferase reporter assay revealed that C/EBP \u03B2 bound to CCSP1 promoter and facilitated its transcription. Therefore, we conclude that there is a C/EBP \u03B2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway in the in vitro ALI model. The study of underlying mechanism show that the activity of C/EBP \u03B2 depends on its phosphorylation:LPS stimulation reduced C/EBP \u03B2 phosphorylation and suppressed the transcription of CCSP1 in BEAS-2B cells, which resulted in enhanced PLA2 and the consequent membrane damage. And further study shows that overexpression of CDK2(Cyclindependent kinase 2), promoted the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03B2 and inhibited PLA2 through the C/EBP \u03B2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway, so as to attenuate membrane damage. The significance of this study lies in that artificial C/EBP \u03B2 phosphorylation regulation may ease the membrane damage in ALI and improve membrane repair.","publish_time":"2017-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shu, Shiyu; Xu, Yan; Xie, Ling; Ouyang, Yufang","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b9249faf42463eb8673c8635f33c34c5d8a8bfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125708.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811191730611X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28760550/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811191730611X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.07.076","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["ALI/ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transcription of CCSP1","model of ALI","ALI model","CCSP1 expression","CCSP1 promoter","regulated CCSP1 transcription","protein expression of CCSP1","phosphorylation of C","damage of cell membrane","EBP \u03B2 phosphorylation regulation","protein levels of CCSP1","bronchial cell membrane","PLA2 pathway","inhibited PLA2","treatment of ALI","membrane repair","protein level of membrane","enhanced PLA2","PLA2 inhibition","consequent membrane damage","self-defense of membrane phospholipids","stability of membrane phospholipids","cleavage of membrane phospholipids","artificial C","activity of C","model cells","key mechanism of ALI","enhancer binding protein \u03B2","endogenous PLA2 inhibitor","important inflammatory mediator of ALI","ARDS","clara cell secretory protein","putative transcription factors","LPS stimulation","present study","study of underlying mechanism","human bronchial epithelial cell line","LPS induction","BEAS","main component of cell membranes","B cells","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Abstract Acute lung injury","excessive inflammatory response damages","integrity of alveolar","common critical emergency","crucial role","high mortality","luciferase reporter assay","CCAAT","effective method","clinical practice","CHIP-PCR","overexpression of CDK2","mRNA","lipopolysaccharide","Cyclindependent kinase","bioinformatics","results","background","basic function","Phospholipase A2","reason","significance"],"language":"en"},

Translating the results of these studies to inform prevention, detection, and response efforts often can be challenging, especially if prior relationships and communications have not been established with decision-makers. Whatever scientific information is shared with decision-makers before, during, and after public health emergencies is highly dependent on the individuals or organizations who are communicating with policy-makers. This article briefly describes the landscape of stakeholders involved in information-sharing before and during emergencies. We identify critical gaps in translation of scientific expertise and results, and biosafety and biosecurity measures to public health policy and practice with a focus on One Health and zoonotic diseases. Finally, we conclude by exploring ways of improving communication and funding, both of which help to address the identified gaps. By leveraging existing scientific information (from both the natural and social sciences) in the public health decision-making process, large-scale outbreaks may be averted even in low-income countries.","publish_time":"2019-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berger, Kavita M.; Wood, James L.

Because dsRNA plays a key role in silencing, a general silencing suppressor strategy is dsRNA binding. The p22 suppressor of the plant virus Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV; genus Crinivirus, family Closteroviridae) has been described as having one of the longest lasting local suppressor activities. However, the mechanism of action of p22 has not been characterized. Here, we show that ToCV p22 binds long dsRNAs in vitro, thus interfering with their processing into small RNAs (sRNAs) by an RNase III-type Dicer homolog enzyme. Additionally, we have studied whether a putative zinc finger motif found in p22 has a role in dsRNA binding and suppressor function. The efficient ability of p22 to suppress RNA silencing, triggered by hairpin transcripts transiently expressed in planta, supports the relationship between its ability to bind dsRNA in vitro and its ability to inhibit RNA silencing in vivo.","publish_time":"2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Landeo-R\u00EDos, Yazm\u00EDn; Navas-Castillo, Jes\u00FAs; Moriones, Enrique; Ca\u00F1izares, M.

On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25(th) January. By 4(th) February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented. By 20(th) February, 619 of 3,700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive. METHODS: We estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using SEIR models. We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship. RESULTS: The basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the [Formula: see text] in the epicentre in Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled initial [Formula: see text] of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the [Formula: see text] to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their incubation time. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions. However, evacuating all passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more passengers and crew from infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rockl\u00F6v, J; Sj\u00F6din, H; Wilder-Smith, A","journal":"J Travel Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51250cb364ae7c01e152a3e93e13546b1f014f35.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taaa030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32109273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Diamond Princess","SEIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["crew","isolation of ill passengers","initial cases","Formula","text","quarantine of non-ill passengers","initial period","cruise ship conditions","basic reproduction number","Cruise ships","cruise ship Diamond Princess","public health measures","absence of countermeasures","additional cases","time period","CONCLUSIONS","outbreak of COVID","interventions","early evacuation","basic reproduction rate","transient functions of countermeasures","later evacuation","SEIR models","incubation time","infected persons","large number of people","confined spaces","removal","relative homogeneous mixing","times higher on-board","impact of differential contact rates","incidence data","guests","index case","groups","scenarios","counterfactual scenario","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","epicentre","Wuhan","METHODS","infection","transmissible disease"],"language":"en"},

Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. It will also be necessary understand the multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies.","publish_time":"2010-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Newell, Diane G.; Koopmans, Marion; Verhoef, Linda; Duizer, Erwin; Aidara-Kane, Awa; Sprong, Hein; Opsteegh, Marieke; Langelaar, Merel; Threfall, John; Scheutz, Flemming; der Giessen, Joke van; Kruse, Hilde","journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b5eee89bf42342044d74bff19d26ef94a3f4e20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132498.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168160510000383; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.01.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20153070/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160510000383","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","Shigella"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["food chain","food-chain","bacterial food","unknown food","food security","contaminated food","safe food","food safety experts","well-recognised food","microbiological safety of food","surveillance of viral food","food production practices","food-related issues","bacterial pathogens","emerging pathogens","Sustaining food safety standards","parasitic pathogens","fewer pathogens","Salmonella","well-recognised diseases","emerging viruses","example antimicrobial resistance","new public health challenges","Campylobacter","changing trends","example Ascaris","collaboration","relative importance","policy issues","importance of diarrhoeal disease","rising importance","burden of diseases","Escherichia coli","future challenges","addition","example fresh produce","new host","policy makers","multiple factors","climate change","multiple interactions","industrialised countries","separate topic","developing world","developed world","review evidence","pathogen populations relevant","infectious intestinal disease","multi-pathogen expertise","Vibrio","multidisciplinary skills","methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas","maintenance of constructive dialogue","order","Shigella","effective prevention","constant vigilance","dynamic situation","generation","parasites","novel opportunities","competition","obesity","environments","transmission","appropriate colonisation site","overall challenge","Norovirus","Hepatitis","resources","rotaviruses","emphasis","wildlife","water","prions","retail","epidemiology","control strategies","excellent vehicle","livestock","improvements","monitoring","Cryptosporidia","Trichinella","Enterococci","Listeria monocytogenes","Current understanding","farm","Awareness","cause of death","global market","foods","downward trend","prediction","lessons","SARS","data"],"language":"en"},

In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viruses have been increasingly implicated. Guidance on testing has also changed. Aims To compare clinicopathological outcomes in young children admitted with bronchiolitis due to RSV in comparison with rhinovirus (RV), and identify associated risk/epidemiological factors. Methods Children aged less than two years admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis with positive results for either RSV or RV were included in this study. Polymerase-chain-reaction-negative cases using an extended respiratory virus panel served as a control group. Retrospective data were collected on sex, risk factors, respiratory support, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) and need for transfer to the high-dependency unit/paediatric intensive care unit were included. Findings Two hundred and twenty-seven out of 437 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were positive for either RSV (N = 162) or RV (N = 65). The median age of cases was three months and 75% had at least one risk factor. Risk factors were higher in the RV group (P = 0.004). RV accounted for the majority of cases outside the RSV season (P \u003C 0.01). RV-associated bronchiolitis had a longer LOS (more than seven days) (P \u003C 0.05) and increased need for chest X-rays and/or antibiotics (P \u003C 0.05). Use of intravenous fluids and respiratory support were higher in the RV group, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions RV is the second most common pathogen associated with bronchiolitis and is isolated all year round. This may be important in those with risk factors resulting in prolonged LOS. Further research is necessary to establish the exact role of RV in this common condition, particularly outside the traditional RSV season.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paul, S.

Study of asymptomatic transmission and implications for surveillance and disease burden are ongoing, but there has been little study of the implications of asymptomatic transmission on dynamics of disease. We use a mathematical framework to evaluate expected effects of asymptomatic transmission on the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, [Formula: see text] will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, [Formula: see text] will be under-estimated. Estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase also depend on asymptomatic generation intervals. Our analysis shows that understanding the temporal course of asymptomatic transmission can be important for assessing the importance of this route of transmission, and for disease dynamics.

There has been inadequate research into how the psychosocial work environment affects compliance with infection control measures, especially in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries. AIM: To examine the association between effort\u2010reward imbalance, burnout and adherence to infection control measures among nurses in Ecuador. INTRODUCTION: A cross\u2010sectional study linking psychosocial work environment indicators to infection control adherence. METHODS: The study was conducted among 333 nurses in four Ecuadorian hospitals. Self\u2010administered questionnaires assessed demographic variables, perceived infection risk, effort\u2010reward imbalance, burnout and infection control adherence. RESULTS: Increased effort\u2010reward imbalance was found to be a unique incremental predictor of exposure to burnout, and burnout was a negative unique incremental predictor of nurses\u0027 self\u2010reported adherence with infection control measures. DISCUSSION: Results suggest an effort\u2010reward imbalance\u2010burnout continuum, which, at higher levels, contributes to reduce adherence to infection control. The Ecuadorean government has made large efforts to improve universal access to health care, yet this study suggests that workplace demands on nurses remain problematic. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the contribution of effort\u2010reward\u2010imbalance\u2010burnout continuum to the chain of infection by decreased adherence to infection control of nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY: Health authorities should closely monitor the effect of new policies on psychosocial work environment, especially when expanding services and increasing public accessibility with limited resources. Additionally, organizational and psychosocial interventions targeting effort\u2010reward imbalance and burnout in nurses should be considered part of a complete infection prevention and control strategy.

We produced two models to estimate areas at potential risk of HeV spillover explained by the climatic suitability for its flying fox reservoir hosts, Pteropus alecto and P. conspicillatus. We included additional climatic variables that might affect spillover risk through other biological processes (such as bat or horse behaviour, plant phenology and bat foraging habitat). Models were fit with a Poisson point process model and a log-Gaussian Cox process. In response to climate change, risk expanded southwards due to an expansion of P. alecto suitable habitat, which increased the number of horses at risk by 175\u2013260% (110,000\u2013165,000). In the northern limits of the current distribution, spillover risk was highly uncertain because of model extrapolation to novel climatic conditions. The extent of areas at risk of spillover from P. conspicillatus was predicted shrink.

A very narrow pattern of pandemic flu-specific IgG epitope recognition was observed in the serum from individuals who later contracted H1N1 infection. Moreover, the pandemic influenza infection generated IgG reactivity to two adjacent epitopes of the neuraminidase protein. The differential serum IgG recognition was focused on haemagglutinin 1 (H1) and restricted to classical antigenic sites (Cb) in both the vaccinated controls and individuals with flu infections. We further identified a novel epitope VEPGDKITFEATGNL on the Ca antigenic site (251\u2013265) of the pandemic flu haemagglutinin, which was exclusively recognized in serum from individuals with previous vaccinations and never in serum from individuals with H1N1 infection (confirmed by RNA PCR analysis from nasal swabs). This epitope was mapped to the receptor-binding domain of the influenza haemagglutinin and could serve as a correlate of immune protection in the context of pandemic flu. The study shows that unbiased epitope mapping using peptide microarray technology leads to the identification of biologically and clinically relevant target structures. Most significantly an H1N1 infection induced a different footprint of IgG epitope recognition patterns compared with the pandemic H1N1 vaccine.","publish_time":"2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ambati, Aditya; Valentini, Davide; Montomoli, Emanuele; Lapini, Guilia; Biuso, Fabrizio; Wenschuh, Holger; Magalhaes, Isabelle; Maeurer, Markus","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96442d0caa3e7c730bd9794da6a25e07b278b4f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4479535.xml.json","url":"https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/imm.12448; https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25639813/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza infection","pandemic flu haemagglutinin","influenza haemagglutinin","pandemic H1N1 vaccine","contracted H1N1 infection","serum IgG epitope signatures","pandemic influenza season","individuals","context of pandemic flu","differential serum IgG recognition","narrow pattern of pandemic flu-specific IgG epitope recognition","IgG reactivity","entire influenza","haemagglutinin proteins","different footprint of IgG epitope recognition patterns","unbiased epitope mapping","novel epitope VEPGDKITFEATGNL","flu infections","peptide microarray technology","high content peptide microarray","Ca antigenic site","classical antigenic sites","Swedish cohort","Pandemrix","RNA PCR analysis","adjacent epitopes","Cb","identification","vaccinated controls","correlate of immune protection","previous vaccinations","nasal swabs","virus","receptor-binding domain","neuraminidase protein","study","subtypes","California","proteome","relevant target structures","South Carolina","strain"],"language":"en"},

Here we show that TIM1 promotes infection of retroviruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with a range of viral entry proteins, in particular those from the filovirus, flavivirus, New World arenavirus and alphavirus families. TIM1 also robustly enhanced the infection of replication-competent viruses from the same families, including dengue, Tacaribe, Sindbis and Ross River viruses. All interactions between TIM1 and pseudoviruses or VLPs were PS-mediated, as demonstrated with liposome blocking and TIM1 mutagenesis experiments. In addition, other PS-binding proteins, such as Axl and TIM4, promoted infection similarly to TIM1. Finally, the blocking of PS receptors on macrophages inhibited the entry of Ebola VLPs, suggesting that PS receptors can contribute to infection in physiologically relevant cells. Notably, infection mediated by the entry proteins of Lassa fever virus, influenza A virus and SARS coronavirus was largely unaffected by TIM1 expression. Taken together our data show that TIM1 and related PS-binding proteins promote infection of diverse families of enveloped viruses, and may therefore be useful targets for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.","publish_time":"2013-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jemielity, Stephanie; Wang, Jinyize J.; Chan, Ying Kai; Ahmed, Asim A.; Li, Wenhui; Monahan, Sheena; Bu, Xia; Farzan, Michael; Freeman, Gordon J.; Umetsu, Dale T.; DeKruyff, Rosemarie H.; Choe, Hyeryun","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10a769cac0a76b41a6a82be148c1a2675e9d4604.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3610696.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23555248/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003232","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Human T-cell Immunoglobulin","PS","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TIM1 expression","Ebola virus","dengue virus","TIM1 mutagenesis experiments","related PS-binding proteins","infection of retroviruses","infection of replication","entry proteins of Lassa fever virus","blocking of PS receptors","entry of Ebola VLPs","infection of diverse families of enveloped viruses","range of viral entry proteins","entry factor","alphavirus families","competent viruses","Ross River viruses","influenza","flavivirus","New World arenavirus","Tacaribe","Mucin-domain","SARS coronavirus","macrophages","filovirus","Sindbis","hepatitis","Human T-cell Immunoglobulin","useful targets","broad-spectrum antiviral therapies","Axl","pseudoviruses","TIM4","cellular receptor","liposome","particles","interactions","data","addition","relevant cells","phosphatidylserine"],"language":"en"},

In this article, we will review the most promising array designs and analysis algorithms that have been developed to date, comparing their strengths and weaknesses for pathogen detection and discovery.","publish_time":"2011-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"McLoughlin, Kevin S.","journal":"Brief Funct Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fa649c67f566b9bcd0450e3a9614cbd6fddf74c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3245552.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21930658/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elr027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microbial detection arrays","pathogen detection arrays","detection of pathogenic organisms","clinical diagnostics","environmental monitoring","environmental samples","analysis algorithms","Statistical algorithms","food safety testing","broad-spectrum technologies","middle ground","multiplex PCR","focused assays","low cost","viable platform","weaknesses","data","high-throughput sequencing","interpretable results","promising array designs","biodefense","strengths","order","date","groups","discovery","DNA microarrays","research context","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Children with persistent or recurrent fever 36 hours after the end of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are considered to be resistant to treatment and are at increased risk for coronary complications. Although concomitant infection does not affect coronary outcome, it is unknown how it influences the response to IVIG treatment. METHODOLOGY: Retrospective cohort study between 2008 and 2016 in a tertiary pediatric university hospital, including 154 children, of which 59 (38%) had concomitant infection. RESULTS: Children with concomitant infection were more likely to have fever 48 hours after initial IVIG treatment (36% vs 20%, p = 0.05) and to be treated with a second dose (33% vs 18%, p = 0.04). Children with infection had higher C-reactive protein at the time of diagnosis (148 vs 112 mg/L, p = 0.04), and 48 hours after IVIG administration (111 vs 59 mg/L, p = 0.003). Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of coronary complications (Z-score \u003E 2.5) between children with and without concomitant infection (36% vs 39%, p = 0.68). CONCLUSION: Children with KD and concomitant infection are more likely to have persistent fever and elevated inflammatory markers after treatment. This association increases the likelihood of receiving a second dose of IVIG but not the risk of coronary complication. Accordingly, prospective studies to distinguish true IVIG resistance from infection induced persistent fever is warranted.","publish_time":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dionne, Audrey; Le, Cathie-Kim; Poupart, Steffany; Autmizguine, Julie; Meloche-Dumas, L\u00E9amarie; Turgeon, Jean; Fournier, Anne; Dahdah, Nagib","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0af0e80af8fd724d1a23f90590617d72b452e1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6192641.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30332473/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","IVIG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["concomitant infection","Children","vs","dose of IVIG","initial IVIG treatment","persistent fever","IVIG administration","hours","true IVIG resistance","recurrent fever","coronary outcome","prevalence of coronary complications","risk of coronary complication","KD","increased risk","higher C-reactive protein","elevated inflammatory markers","end of intravenous immunoglobulin","time of diagnosis","prospective studies","Z-score","tertiary pediatric university hospital","significant difference","METHODOLOGY","Retrospective cohort study","INTRODUCTION","Kawasaki disease","bacterial infections","response","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","likelihood","association"],"language":"en"},

Although global and national AMR action plans are in place, infection prevention and control is primarily discussed in the context of healthcare facilities with home and everyday life settings barely addressed. As seen with the recent global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, everyday hygiene measures can play an important role in containing the threat from infectious microorganisms. This position paper has been developed following a meeting of global experts in London, 2019. It presents evidence that home and community settings are important for infection transmission and also the acquisition and spread of AMR. It also demonstrates that the targeted hygiene approach offers a framework for maximizing protection against colonization and infections, thereby reducing antibiotic prescribing and minimizing selection pressure for the development of antibiotic resistance. If combined with the provision of clean water and sanitation, targeted hygiene can reduce the circulation of resistant bacteria in homes and communities, regardless of a country\u0027s Human Development Index (overall social and economic development). Achieving a reduction of AMR strains in healthcare settings requires a mirrored reduction in the community. The authors call upon national and international policy makers, health agencies and healthcare professionals to further recognize the importance of targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings for preventing and controlling infection, in a unified quest to tackle AMR.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maillard, Jean-Yves; Bloomfield, Sally F.; Courvalin, Patrice; Essack, Sabiha Y.; Gandra, Sumanth; Gerba, Charles P.; Rubino, Joseph R.; Scott, Elizabeth A.","journal":"Am J Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7f0498a61125856f2f677b3cdd9a7fc4dbb5a75.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311380/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.04.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320302091; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320302091?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthcare settings","everyday life settings","community settings","global health","everyday hygiene measures","importance of targeted hygiene","targeted hygiene approach","reduction of AMR strains","development of antibiotic resistance","national AMR action plans","healthcare professionals","infection transmission","infection prevention","economic development","meeting of global experts","recent global SARS-CoV","context of healthcare facilities","health agencies","important role","country\u0027s Human Development Index","antibiotic prescribing","mirrored reduction","Antimicrobial resistance","place","international policy makers","pandemic","selection pressure","communities","framework","sanitation","circulation of resistant bacteria","provision of clean water","protection","homes","infections","threat","colonization","control","authors","London","unified quest","acquisition","evidence","infectious microorganisms","position paper"],"language":"en"},

Reaction efficiencies for the M. cynos tuf gene assay on 2 platforms were based on amplification of standard curves spanning 8 orders of magnitude: ABI 7500 platform, 94.3\u201397.9% (r(2) \u2265 0.9935); QuantStudio OpenArray platform, 119.1\u2013122.5% (r(2) = 0.9784).

Diagnostic performance was estimated by comparison with an in-house legacy assay on clinical specimens as well as testing isolates that were characterized previously by intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequencing. Exclusivity was established by testing 12 other Mycoplasma species. To substantiate the high specificity of the M. cynos tuf gene assay, sequence confirmation was performed on ISR PCR amplicons obtained from clinical specimens.

Three mAbs (7B3, 1C11, and 6A6) that showed the most potent and broad neutralization activities against the African, Asian, and American strains were selected for further analysis. mAb 7B3 showed an IC50 value of 11.6 ng/mL against the circulating American strain GZ02. Epitope mapping revealed that mAbs 7B3 and 1C11 targeted residue K394 of the lateral ridge (LR) epitope of the EDIII domain, but 7B3 has a broader LR epitope footprint and recognizes residues T335, G337, E370, and N371 as well. mAb 6A6 recognized residues D67, K118, and K251 of the EDII domain. Interestingly, although the patient was seronegative for DENV infection, mAb 1C11, originating from the VH3-23 and VK1-5 germline pair, neutralized both ZIKV and DENV1.

The expansion and increased endemicity of dengue and West Nile viruses in the Americas exemplifies their medical and epidemiological importance. The rapid detection of viral infection and induction of the innate antiviral response are crucial to determining the outcome of infection. The intracellular pathogen receptors RIG-I and MDA5 play a central role in detecting flavivirus infections and initiating a robust antiviral response. Yet, these viruses are still capable of producing acute illness in humans. It is now clear that flaviviruses utilize a variety of mechanisms to modulate the interferon response. The non-structural proteins of the various flaviviruses reduce expression of interferon dependent genes by blocking phosphorylation, enhancing degradation or down-regulating expression of major components of the JAK/STAT pathway. Recent studies indicate that interferon modulation is an important factor in the development of severe flaviviral illness. This suggests that an increased understanding of viral-host interactions will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics to treat these viral infections and improved biological models to study flavivirus pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2010-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mu\u00F1oz-Jord\u00E1n, Jorge L.; Fredericksen, Brenda L.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00cb1a95986171a256f5ef14701bd8f571221a28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3185611.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994652/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v2020676","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JAK/STAT"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["interferon response","viral infections","flavivirus infections","interferon modulation","increased understanding of viral","flavivirus genus","innate antiviral response","robust antiviral response","expression of interferon dependent genes","rapid detection of viral infection","West Nile viruses","study flavivirus pathogenesis","various flaviviruses","development of severe flaviviral illness","outcome of infection","acute illness","increased endemicity of dengue","expression of major components","development of novel therapeutics","improved biological models","induction","Americas","important factor","host interactions","MDA5","JAK","remarkable ability","disease","phosphorylation","central role","variety of mechanisms","intracellular pathogen receptors RIG","STAT pathway","non-structural proteins","epidemiological importance","humans","degradation","expansion","Recent studies","large scale"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective observational study performed at an Australian hospital over a 4-month winter period during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Levels on admission of procalcitonin and CRP were compared between patients admitted to the ICU with community-acquired pneumonia of bacterial and 2009 H1N1 origin. RESULTS: Compared to those with bacterial or mixed infection (n = 9), patients with 2009 H1N1 infection (n = 16) were significantly more likely to have bilateral chest X-ray infiltrates, lower APACHE scores, more prolonged lengths of stay in ICU and lower white cell count, procalcitonin and CRP levels. Using a cutoff of \u003E0.8 ng/ml, the sensitivity and specificity of procalcitonin for detection of patients with bacterial/mixed infection were 100 and 62%, respectively. A CRP cutoff of \u003E200 mg/l best identified patients with bacterial/mixed infection (sensitivity 100%, specificity 87.5%). In combination, procalcitonin levels \u003E0.8 ng/ml and CRP \u003E200 mg/l had optimal sensitivity (100%), specificity (94%), negative predictive value (100%) and positive predictive value (90%). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis suggested the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin may be inferior to CRP in this setting. CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin measurement potentially assists in the discrimination between severe lower respiratory tract infections of bacterial and 2009 H1N1 origin, although less effectively than CRP. Low values, particularly when combined with low CRP levels, suggested bacterial infection, alone or in combination with influenza, was unlikely.","publish_time":"2010-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ingram, Paul Robert; Inglis, Tim; Moxon, David; Speers, David","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/459569c05333057b507b69ed972fe18a34594699.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080172.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20069274/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-009-1746-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial infection","procalcitonin levels","H1N1 infection","specificity of procalcitonin","low CRP levels","CRP cutoff","H1N1 influenza infection","mixed infection","Procalcitonin measurement","admission of procalcitonin","pneumonia of bacterial origin","H1N1 origin","ICU","diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin","H1N1 influenza pandemic","detection of patients","identified patients","severe lower respiratory tract infections of bacterial","community","combination","optimal sensitivity","lower APACHE scores","positive predictive value","negative predictive value","lower white cell count","Low values","discrimination","bilateral chest X-ray infiltrates","Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis","prolonged lengths","Australian hospital","month winter period","C-reactive protein","retrospective observational study","adult intensive care unit","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","setting","RESULTS","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

This structure illuminates the assembly of the coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery, provides key insights into NSP12 polymerase catalysis and fidelity and acts as a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.","publish_time":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kirchdoerfer, Robert N.; Ward, Andrew B.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77a04c5091c0457ad305691d4d4f24354d6bae79.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ea907e30abe80893c48a93731c465e02b656e785.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/551986","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase","NSP12 polymerase catalysis","viral polymerases","viral genome","NSP8 co-factors","essential co-factors","multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins","MERS-CoV","pathogenic coronaviruses","coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery","\u00C5 resolution structure","key insights","acts","fidelity","NSP7","template","single particle cryo-electron microscopy","replication","large N-terminal extension","kinase","design of novel antiviral therapeutics","emergence","infecting host cells","transcription","assembly","architecture common","human circulation","Recent history","fold"],"language":"en"},

The screening protocol was validated using known 3CLpro inhibitors and was optimized for speed, improved selectivity, and for accommodating receptor flexibility. Subsequently, a fluorescence-based enzymatic HTS assay was developed and optimized to experimentally screen approximately 41,000 compounds from four structurally diverse libraries chosen mainly based on the VS results. False positives from initial HTS hits were eliminated by a secondary orthogonal binding analysis using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The campaign identified a reversible small molecule inhibitor exhibiting mixed-type inhibition with a K(i) value of 11.1 \u03BCM.

Semistructured interviews were conducted with HCP involved with decision-making during EVD preparations at acute care hospitals in the Chicago, IL area to gather information about the PPE selection and training process. HCP who received training were surveyed about elements of training and their perceived impact and overall experience by email invitation. A total of 28 HCP from 15 hospitals were interviewed, and 55 HCP completed the survey. Factors affecting PPE selection included: changing guidance, vendor supply, performance evaluations, and perceived risk and comfort for HCP. Cost did not affect selection. PPE acquisition challenges were mitigated by: sharing within hospital networks, reusing PPE during training, and improvising with existing PPE stock. Selected PPE ensembles were similar across sites. Training included hands-on activities with trained observers, instructional videos, and simulations/drills, which were felt to increase HCP confidence. Many felt refresher training would be helpful. Hands-on training was perceived to be effective, but there is a need to establish the appropriate frequency of refresher training frequency to maintain competence. Lacking confidence in the CDC guidance, interviewed trainers described turning to other sources of information and developing independent PPE evaluation and selection. Response to emerging and/or high consequence infectious diseases would be enhanced by transparent, risk-based guidance for PPE selection and training that addresses protection level, ease of use, ensembles, and availability.","publish_time":"2019-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bleasdale, Susan C.; Sikka, Monica K.; Moritz, Donna C.; Fritzen-Pedicini, Charissa; Stiehl, Emily; Brosseau, Lisa M.; Jones, Rachael M.","journal":"J Occup Environ Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4e984a70547dcb31289a44b4397c2db03e54eb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157968.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2019.1628966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31283428/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","EVD","HCP","CDC"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["PPE selection","Hands-on training","elements of training","training process","Selected PPE ensembles","felt refresher training","HCP confidence","independent PPE evaluation","existing PPE stock","PPE acquisition challenges","appropriate frequency of refresher training frequency","EVD preparations","EVD outbreak","perceived risk","EVD patients","CDC guidance","risk-based guidance","perceived impact","high-consequence infectious diseases","high consequence infectious diseases","factors","acute care hospitals","trained observers","future preparations","sources of information","hands-on activities","interviewed trainers","Lacking confidence","trained healthcare personnel","instructional videos","United States","performance evaluations","personal protective equipment","Chicago","protection level","overall experience","ease of use","vendor supply","IL area","anticipation","decision-making","context","email invitation","Ebola Virus Disease","simulations","sites","comfort","drills","need","competence","hospital networks","availability","Semistructured interviews","total","Response","Cost","survey"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: We sought to quantify the impact of the presence of emergent patients and other related factors on the delay in service for non-emergent patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in patients who visited the ED of a large hospital in Hong Kong from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010. We estimated waiting and length of stay (LOS) for individual non-emergent patients registered during day and evening shifts. Using multiple linear regression, we estimated waiting time and LOS as a function of the presence of emergent patients and other related factors such as patient demographics and clinical factors. In particular, we evaluated the influence of the arrival or presence of emergent patients on the odds of violating the 120-min waiting time target for semi-urgent patients. RESULTS: The arrival of a new emergent patient prolonged the waiting time and LOS of a non-emergent patient by 14.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.2\u201315.5) and 10.8% (95% CI 10.6\u201311.0), respectively. An additional patient-hour needed for an emergent patient increased the probability of violating the waiting time target for non-emergent patients (odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI 2.2\u20132.4). CONCLUSIONS: The arrival of an emergent patient significantly prolonged the waiting time and LOS for non-emergent patients. Discouraging non-urgent ED utilization and building a real-time decision-support system are critical methods needed to relieve staff pressure and guide contingent resource reallocation when emergent patients arrive.","publish_time":"2013-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Mai; Wong, Tse Chiu; Wong, Shui Yee; Chin, Kwai Sang; Tsui, Kwok Leung; Hsia, Renee Y.","journal":"J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77ca3e5704b337097c2eacf39054697292986341.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126712.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467913001303; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2012.11.102; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467913001303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23759699/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Hong Kong Emergency Departments"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["presence of emergent patients","individual non-emergent patients","increasing attendance of non-emergent patients","new emergent patient","semi-urgent patients","unpredictable arrival of emergency patients","waiting time target","LOS","patient demographics","non-urgent ED utilization","additional patient-hour","related factors","clinical factors","Hong Kong Emergency Departments","critical methods","odds ratio","staff pressure","real-time decision-support system","contingent resource reallocation","day","delay","EDs","probability","function","timeliness","large hospital","BACKGROUND","retrospective study","evening shifts","length of stay","influence","impact","multiple linear regression","high-quality services","confidence interval","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Tianjin, a northeastern city in China, was chosen as the region of research and applied the influenza-like illness attack rate (ILI)% as the baseline and warning line to determine the severity of influenza epidemic. Then, an influenza early warning model was constructed based on the theory of rough set and support vector machines (RS-SVM), and the relationship between influenza and meteorology was explored through analyzing the monitoring data. RESULTS: The predictive performance of the model was good, which had achieved 81.8% accuracy when grouping the obtained data into three levels that represent no danger, danger of a light epidemic, and danger of a severe epidemic. The test results showed that if the host qi and guest qi were not balanced, this kind of situation was more likely to cause influenza outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak of influenza closely relates to temperature, humidity, visibility, and wind speed and is consistent with some part of CM doctrine. The result also indicates that there is some reasonable evidence in the Yunqi theory.","publish_time":"2012-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Xue-qin; Quirchmayr, Gerald; Winiwarter, Werner; Cui, Meng","journal":"Chin J Integr Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cc3b34d1d43c90f8fb6f8b02c68a0df8ffb7f20.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-012-1003-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22466943/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["outbreak of influenza","influenza outbreaks","influenza early warning model","severity of influenza epidemic","Yunqi theory","danger","theory of rough set","warning line","light epidemic","severe epidemic","ancient calendar theory of Chinese medicine","host qi","guest qi","obtained data","test results","monitoring data","support vector machines","weather conditions","RS-SVM","humidity","Tianjin","northeastern city","China","wind speed","visibility","illness attack rate","predictive performance","temperature","levels","METHODS","baseline","kind of situation","meteorology","relationship","reasonable evidence","region of research","accuracy","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSIONS","doctrine"],"language":"en"},

Despite the progress that has been made in the mapping and characterization of some packaging signals, there is conflicting evidence as to whether the viral nucleocapsid protein or the membrane protein plays the primary role in packaging signal recognition. The different models for the mechanism of genomic RNA packaging that have been prompted by these competing views are described.

New IBV geno- and serotypes are continually reported. However, information on IBV prevalence is not frequently addressed in these reports. This study reports on a viral surveillance program in Taiwan from 2005 to 2006 with sampling conducted in poultry slaughterhouses. The genetic features of the obtained field isolates were investigated using sequence analysis and SimPlot analysis. A 1-directional neutralization test was performed to examine the antigenic variations among the collected viruses. The selection pressures that may contribute to the evolution of Taiwan IBV during recent decades were assessed. The surveillance program revealed that 8 out of 47 flocks (17%) were IBV-infected, from which 13 IBV isolates were recovered. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene, 11 of 13 isolates (84.6%) clustered with Taiwan group I. One IBV isolate showed evidence of frequent recombination events with China-like IBV in the spike glycoprotein (S) gene. Another isolate demonstrated the incorporation of China-like and H120-like genome fragments within the S2 gene and the membrane protein (M) gene region, respectively. Some antigenic changes were found in the 1-directional neutralization test. However, no positive selection pressures were related to those variations in the S1 genes among Taiwan IBV. Based on our work, we suggest that sampling chickens in poultry slaughterhouses is an effective and valuable means of compiling viral prevalence data, particularly in situations where there is subclinical infection. Infectious bronchitis viruses from slaughtered chickens revealed intertypic genetic recombination and antigenic diversity.","publish_time":"2010-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, H. W.; Huang, Y.

Vaccine development has traditionally focused on whole organism vaccines, either live attenuated or inactivated vaccines. While successful for many different infectious diseases whole organisms are expensive to produce, require culture of the infectious agent, and have the potential to cause vaccine associated disease in hosts. With advancing technology and a desire to develop safe, cost effective vaccine candidates, the field began to focus on the development of recombinantly expressed antigens known as subunit vaccines. While more tolerable, subunit vaccines tend to be less immunogenic. Attempts have been made to increase immunogenicity with the addition adjuvants, either immunostimulatory molecules or an antigen delivery system that increases immune responses to vaccines. An area of extreme interest has been the application of nanotechnology to vaccine development, which allows for antigens to be expressed on a particulate delivery system. One of the most exciting examples of nanovaccines are rationally designed protein nanoparticles. These nanoparticles use some of the basic tenants of structural biology, biophysical chemistry, and vaccinology to develop protective, safe, and easily manufactured vaccines. Rationally developed nanoparticle vaccines are one of the most promising candidates for the future of vaccine development.","publish_time":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karch, Christopher P.; Burkhard, Peter","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ad9d14f7f65cb860f407759ae6307a2841d3541.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ac214d6bd3b4db8cc28b85f435816dc374b61d88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5079805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27157411/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006295216300740; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2016.05.001; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5079805?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295216300740","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subunit vaccines","organism vaccines","inactivated vaccines","future of vaccine development","developed nanoparticle vaccines","effective vaccine candidates","development of recombinantly expressed antigens","antigen delivery system","particulate delivery system","promising candidates","infectious agent","different infectious diseases","designed protein nanoparticles","morbidity","biophysical chemistry","public health","immunostimulatory molecules","basic tenants of structural biology","mortality","vaccinology","significant advancement","immune responses","addition adjuvants","exciting examples of nanovaccines","desire","organisms","potential","field","application of nanotechnology","immunogenicity","millions of people","culture","advancing technology","hosts","area of extreme","Attempts"],"language":"en"},

In CD4(\u002B) T cells, the transcription factor Oct1/Pou2f1 is a dispensable transcription factor for T cell development and response to primary infection, but promotes expression of target genes, including Il2 and Ifng, under conditions of antigen reencounter. As a result, they are more strongly expressed upon secondary stimulation. Such repeated antigen encounters occur in memory recall responses, in autoimmunity where self-antigen can be recognized multiple times, and in chronic infection where foreign antigen is persistent. Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that Oct1 loss would protect animals from autoimmunity but maintain normal responses to pathogens in the CNS. OBJECTIVE: We used a conditional mouse Oct1 (Pou2f1) allele and a CD4-Cre driver to determine the effect of T cell-specific Oct1 loss on autoimmune- and viral-induced neuroinflammation using an autoantigen-driven EAE model of autoimmunity and a JHMV model of viral infection. RESULTS: Oct1 conditional deletion mitigated clinical scores and reduced infiltrating T cells and cytokine production in the EAE model. Consistently, Oct1-deficient CD4(\u002B) T cells stimulated in vitro showed increased expression of markers associated with T cell anergy, particularly in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. In contrast, anti-viral T cell effector functions are intact in the absence of Oct1, with no changes in neuroinflammation, infiltrating T cells or cytokine production. CONCLUSION: Our findings uncover a significant difference between the effect of Oct1 loss on autoimmune and anti-pathogen responses, which potentially could be exploited for therapeutic benefit.

The molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of the disease remain poorly understood, particularly the resistance of porcine immune system to HPS invasion. In this study, we investigated the global changes in gene expression in the spleen following HPS infection using the Affymetrix Porcine Genechip\u2122. RESULTS: A total of 931 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts were identified in the porcine spleen 7 days after HPS infection; of these, 92 unique genes showed differential expression patterns based on analysis using BLASTX and Gene Ontology. The DE genes involved in the immune response included genes for inflammasomes (RETN, S100A8, S100A9, S100A12), adhesion molecules (CLDN3, CSPG2, CD44, LGALS8), transcription factors (ZBTB16, SLC39A14, CEBPD, CEBPB), acute-phase proteins and complement (SAA1, LTF, HP, C3), differentiation genes for epithelial cells and keratinocytes (TGM1, MS4A8B, CSTA), and genes related to antigen processing and presentation (HLA-B, HLA-DRB1). Further immunostimulation analyses indicated that mRNA levels of S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 in porcine PK-15 cells increased within 48 h and were sustained after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Poly(I:C) respectively. In addition, mapping of DE genes to porcine health traits QTL regions showed that 70 genes were distributed in 7 different known porcine QTL regions. Finally, 10 DE genes were validated by quantitative PCR. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate previously unrecognized changes in gene transcription that are associated with HPS infection in vivo, and many potential cascades identified in the study clearly merit further investigation. Our data provide new clues to the nature of the immune response in mammals, and we have identified candidate genes that are related to resistance to HPS.","publish_time":"2009-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Hongbo; Li, Changchun; Fang, Mingdi; Zhu, Mengjin; Li, Xinyun; Zhou, Rui; Li, Kui; Zhao, Shuhong","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27869d617d1c3766400b9f33f31e28f8fb1bdbd0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2660370.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-10-64; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19196461/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPS","DE","HP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["differentiation genes","unique genes","candidate genes","HPS infection","porcine spleen","porcine PK","HPS invasion","resistance of porcine immune system","Affymetrix Porcine Genechip","gene expression","gene transcription","immune response","porcine health traits QTL regions","different known porcine QTL regions","S100A9","S100A12","Gene Ontology","study","transcription factors","epithelial cells","HLA-B","unrecognized changes","HLA-DRB1","global changes","Gl\u00E4sser\u0027s disease","differential expression patterns","mRNA levels of S100A8","keratinocytes","CEBPB","complement","SAA1","ZBTB16","LGALS8","CLDN3","CD44","nature","analysis","presentation","RETN","inflammasomes","adhesion molecules","acute-phase proteins","important swine pathogen","CEBPD","CSPG2","LTF","SLC39A14","TGM1","BLASTX","MS4A8B","antigen processing","findings","mammals","CSTA","mapping","days","fibrinous polyserositis","immunostimulation analyses","new clues","Haemophilus parasuis","potential cascades","administration of lipopolysaccharide","LPS","meningitis","arthritis","data","pathogenesis","BACKGROUND","molecular mechanisms","CONCLUSION","quantitative PCR","addition"],"language":"en"},

The disease presents variably with multiple organ failure, seizures, generalized effusion, or shock. Neurological FIP is clinically and pathologically more homogeneous than systemic \u2018wet\u2019 or \u2018dry\u2019 FIP; thus, comparison of cytokine profiles from cats with neurological FIP, wet FIP, and non-FIP neurological disease may provide insight into some baseline characteristics relating to the immunopathogenesis of neurological FIP. This study characterizes inflammation and changes in cytokines in the brain tissue of FIP-affected cats. Cellular infiltrates in cats with FIP included lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-\u03B1, macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-1\u03B1, and RANTES showed no upregulation in the brains of control cats, moderate upregulation in neurological FIP cats, and very high upregulation in generalized FIP cats. Transcription of IFN-\u03B3 appeared upregulated in cats with systemic FIP and slightly downregulated in neurological FIP. In most cytokines tested, variance was extremely high in generalized FIP and much less in neurological FIP. Principal components analysis was performed in order to find the least number of \u2018components\u2019 that would summarize the cytokine profiles in cats with neurological FIP. A large component of the variance (91.7%) was accounted for by levels of IL-6, MIP-1\u03B1, and RANTES.

Surfactant protein D (SP-D) belongs to the family of C-type lectins which are important effector molecules of the innate immune system with activity against bacteria and viruses, including influenza viruses. In the present study we evaluated the potential of recombinant porcine SP-D as an antiviral agent against influenza A viruses (IAVs) in vitro. To determine the range of antiviral activity, thirty IAVs of the subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 that originated from birds, pigs and humans were selected and tested for their sensitivity to recombinant SP-D. Using these viruses it was shown by hemagglutination inhibition assay, that recombinant porcine SP-D was more potent than recombinant human SP-D and that especially higher order oligomeric forms of SP-D had the strongest antiviral activity. Porcine SP-D was active against a broad range of IAV strains and neutralized a variety of H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs, including 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Using tissue sections of ferret and human trachea, we demonstrated that recombinant porcine SP-D prevented attachment of human seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 virus to receptors on epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. It was concluded that recombinant porcine SP-D holds promise as a novel antiviral agent against influenza and further development and evaluation in vivo seems warranted.","publish_time":"2011-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hillaire, Marine L.

This review is focused on current knowledge about the activation and regulation of chemoattractant receptors. Emphasis is placed on the members of the N-formyl peptide receptor family, namely FPR (N-formyl peptide receptor), FPRL1 (FPR like-1) and FPRL2 (FPR like-2), and the complement fragment C5a receptors (C5aR and C5L2). Upon chemoattractant binding, the receptors transduce an activation signal through a G protein-dependent pathway, leading to biochemical responses that contribute to physiological defense against bacterial infection and tissue damage. C5aR, and the members of the FPR family that were previously thought to be restricted to phagocytes proved to have a much broader spectrum of cell expression. In addition to N-formylated peptides, numerous unrelated ligands were recently found to interact with FPR and FPRL1. Novel agonists include both pathogen- and host-derived components, and synthetic peptides. Antagonistic molecules have been identified that exhibit limited receptor specificity. How distinct ligands can both induce different biological responses and produce different modes of receptor activation and unique sets of cellular responses are discussed. Cell responses to chemoattractants are tightly regulated at the level of the receptors. This review describes in detail the regulation of receptor signalling and the multi-step process of receptor inactivation. New concepts, such as receptor oligomerization and receptor clustering, are considered. Although FPR, FPRL1 and C5aR trigger similar biological functions and undergo a rapid chemoattractant-mediated phosphorylation, they appear to be differentially regulated and experience different intracellular fates.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rabiet, Marie-Jos\u00E8phe; Huet, Emilie; Boulay, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"Biochimie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/704c385ae753dbfd507abdfbc213e254e07c4b3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115771.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908407000508; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908407000508","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["receptor oligomerization","receptor clustering","FPR family","different modes of receptor activation","regulation of receptor signalling","N-formyl peptide receptor family","limited receptor specificity","different biological responses","Cell responses","C5aR","regulation of chemoattractant receptors","FPRL1","biochemical responses","multi-step process of receptor inactivation","activation signal","N-formylated peptides","members","chemoattractant binding","review","unique sets of cellular responses","complement fragment C5a receptors","bacterial infection","synthetic peptides","experience different intracellular fates","rapid chemoattractant-mediated phosphorylation","distinct ligands","similar biological functions","numerous unrelated ligands","G protein-dependent pathway","broader spectrum of cell expression","physiological defense","sites of inflammation","pathogen","host-derived components","tissue damage","Abstract Leukocyte recruitment","gradient","C5L2","current knowledge","presence","New concepts","addition","chemoattractants","Novel agonists","chemotactic factors","level","FPRL2","Antagonistic molecules","phagocytes","Emphasis"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the genes that control tolerance and resistance could provide new strategies to improve the health and welfare of livestock. Around one sixth of the world cattle population is estimated to be at risk from one of the most debilitating tick-borne diseases of cattle, caused by the protozoan parasite, Theileria annulata. The parasite mainly infects cells of the myeloid lineage which are also the main producers of inflammatory cytokines. If an infectious or inflammatory insult is sufficiently great, inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages enter the circulation and induce an acute phase proteins (APP) response. The Bos taurus Holstein breed produces higher and more prolonged levels of inflammatory cytokine induced APP than the Bos indicus Sahiwal breed in response to experimental infection with T. annulata. The Sahiwal exhibits significantly less pathology and survives infection, unlike the Holstein breed. Therefore, we hypothesised that the causal genes were likely to be expressed in macrophages and control the production of inflammatory cytokines. A functional genomics approach revealed that the transcriptome profile of the B. taurus macrophages was more associated with an inflammatory programme than the B. indicus macrophages. In particular the most differentially expressed gene was a member of the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) family. These are mainly expressed on myeloid cell surfaces and control inflammatory responses. Other differentially expressed genes included bovine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (BoLA) class II genes, particularly BoLA DQ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)B2. We are now exploring whether sequence and functional differences in the bovine SIRP family may underlie the resistance or tolerance to T. annulata between the breeds. Potentially, our research may also have more general implications for the control of inflammatory processes against other pathogens. Genes controlling the balance between pathology and protection may determine how livestock can survive in the face of infectious onslaught. Next generation sequencing and RNAi methodologies for livestock species will bring new opportunities to link diversity at the genome level to functional differences in health traits in livestock species.","publish_time":"2012-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glass, Elizabeth J.; Crutchley, Sarah; Jensen, Kirsty","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b985b60cd0dc2a4351b235b3c276bc717a2e8b05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112524.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22482839/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242712000797; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242712000797","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein","BoLA DQ"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inflammatory insult","inflammatory programme","control inflammatory responses","control of inflammatory processes","production of inflammatory cytokines","main producers of inflammatory cytokines","livestock species","indicus macrophages","taurus macrophages","causal genes","functional differences","welfare of livestock","breeds of cattle","prolonged levels of inflammatory cytokine induced APP","Bos indicus Sahiwal breed","Bos taurus Holstein breed","bovine SIRP family","resistance","tolerance","Theileria annulata","pathology","functional genomics approach","world cattle population","health traits","BoLA DQ","new opportunities","new strategies","experimental infection","myeloid lineage","debilitating tick-borne diseases of cattle","protozoan parasite","specific pathogens","myeloid cell surfaces","face of infectious onslaught","bovine major histocompatibility complex","MHC","genome level","long histories of living","RNAi methodologies","transcriptome profile","signal regulatory protein","areas of endemic disease","growth factor","acute phase proteins","diversity","circulation","class","generation sequencing","general implications","mechanisms","member","TGF","B2","cells","protection","balance","sequence","risk","research"],"language":"en"},

Methods Cross-sectional study, from January 2011 to December 2012. The secretions of nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in children younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated at the Grupo em Defesa da Crian\u00E7a Com C\u00E2ncer (Grendacc) and University Hospital (HU), Jundia\u00ED, SP. The rapid test was used for detection of influenza virus (Kit Biotrin, Inc., Ireland), and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD, Respiratory pathogens, multiplex Fast Trade Kit, Malta) for detection of influenza virus (H1N1, B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus. The prevalence of viral infection was estimated and association tests were used (\u03C72 or Fisher\u0027s exact test). Results 104 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate and blood were analyzed. The median age was 12\u00B15.2 years, 51% males, 68% whites, 32% had repeated ARIs, 32% prior antibiotic use, 19.8% cough, and 8% contact with ARIs. A total of 94.3% were in good general status. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (42.3%) was the most prevalent neoplasia. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50 samples: rhinoviruses (23.1%), respiratory syncytial virus AB (8.7%), and coronavirus (6.8%). Codetection occurred in 19% of cases with 2 viruses and in 3% of those with 3 viruses, and was more frequent between rhinovirus and coronavirus 43. Fever in neutropenic patients was observed in 13%, of which four (30.7) were positive for viruses. There were no deaths. Conclusions The prevalence of respiratory viruses was relevant in the infectious episode, with no increase in morbidity and mortality.

MiRNAs contribute to RNA virus pathogenesis by promoting antiviral immune response, enhancing viral replication, or altering miRNA-mediated host gene regulation. Thus, exploration of the virus\u2013miRNA interactions occurring in PHEV-infected host may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms combating the virus life cycle or pathogenesis. Here, we discovered that the expression of miR-10a-5p was constitutively up-regulated by PHEV in both the N2a cells in vitro and mice brain in vivo. Treatment with miR-10a-5p mimics allowed miR-10a-5p enrichment and resulted in a significant restriction in PHEV replication, suggesting widespread negative regulation of the RNA virus infection by miR-10a-5p. The outcomes were also evidenced by miR-10a-5p inhibitor over-expression. Luciferase reporter, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting analysis further showed that Syndecan 1 (SDC1), a cell surface proteoglycan associated with host defense mechanisms, acts as a target gene of miR-10a-5p during PHEV infection. Naturally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SDC1 leads to a reduction in viral replication, implying that SDC1 expression is likely a favorable condition for viral replication. Together, the findings demonstrated that the abundant miR-10a-5p leads to downstream suppression of SDC1, and it functions as an antiviral mechanism in the PHEV-induced disease, providing a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of PHEV infection in the future work.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Shiyu; Li, Zi; Lan, Yungang; Guan, Jiyu; Zhao, Kui; Chu, Dianfeng; Fan, Gencheng; Guo, Yuguang; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3078165241b24fed34596efa9f563661f1caa00c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7044266.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32153518/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV","Syndecan"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PHEV replication","expression of miR","PHEV-infected host","treatment of PHEV infection","abundant miR","RNA virus infection","viral replication","SDC1 expression","p enrichment","p mimics","RNA virus pathogenesis","target gene of miR","PHEV-induced disease","p inhibitor over-expression","miRNA-mediated host gene regulation","host transcriptome","host defense mechanisms","virus life cycle","miRNA interactions","Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","siRNA-mediated knockdown of SDC1","downstream suppression of SDC1","widespread negative regulation","qRT-PCR","widespread alterations","single-stranded RNA coronavirus","infected hosts","antiviral mechanism","quantitative real-time PCR","antiviral immune response","identification of novel mechanisms","nervous dysfunction","acts","favorable condition","cell surface proteoglycan","potential strategy","specific microRNA","prevention","significant restriction","Luciferase reporter","western blotting analysis","Syndecan","N2a cells","reduction","future work","mice brain","levels","exploration","MiRNAs","findings","outcomes"],"language":"en"},

Our previous crystal structure study of the MHV NTD/mCEACAM1a complex (G. Peng, D. Sun, K. R. Rajashankar, Z. Qian, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 108:10696\u201310701, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1104306108) reveals that there are 14 residues in the NTD interacting with the receptor. However, their contribution to receptor binding and virus entry has not been fully investigated. Here we analyzed 13 out of 14 contact residues by mutagenesis and identified I22 as being essential for receptor binding and virus entry. Unexpectedly, we found that G29 was critical for the conformational changes of the S protein triggered by either receptor binding or high pH. Replacement of G29 with A, D, F, K, M, and T, to different extents, caused spontaneous dissociation of S1 from the S protein, resulting in an enhancement of high-pH-triggered receptor-independent syncytium (RIS) formation in HEK293T cells, compared to the wild type (WT). In contrast, replacement of G29 with P, a turn-prone residue with a strict conformation, hindered virus entry and conformational changes of the S protein triggered by either receptor binding or pH 8.0, suggesting that the structural turn around G29 and its flexibility are critical. Finally, stabilization of the NTD by G29P had almost no effect on pH-independent RIS induced by the Y320A mutation in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 subunit, indicating that there might be an absence of cross talk between the NTD and CTD during conformational changes of the S protein. Our study will aid in better understanding the mechanism of how conformational changes of the S protein are triggered. IMPORTANCE Binding of the MHV S protein to the receptor mCEACAM1a triggers conformational changes of S proteins, leading to the formation of a six-helix bundle and viral and cellular membrane fusion. However, the mechanism by which the conformational change of the S protein is initiated after receptor binding has not been determined. In this study, we showed that while replacement of G29, a residue at the edge of the receptor binding interface and the center of the structural turn after the \u03B21-sheet of the S protein, with D or T triggered spontaneous conformational changes of the S protein and pH-independent RIS, the G29P mutation significantly impeded the conformational changes of S proteins triggered by either receptor binding or pH 8.0. We reason that this structural turn might be critical for conformational changes of the S protein and that altering this structural turn could initiate conformational changes of the S protein, leading to membrane fusion.","publish_time":"2019-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mi, Dan; Ou, Xiuyuan; Li, Pei; Peng, Guiqing; Liu, Yan; Guo, Ruixuan; Mu, Zhixia; Li, Fang; Holmes, Kathryn; Qian, Zhaohui","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acee92aa1bfa77bcb9516cbed2ef86751d5bcab5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6798120.xml.json","url":"https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/20/e01046-19.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31375571/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01046-19","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["K.

Stably and transiently transformed plants have particular advantages that enable immunization of humans and animals via mucosal delivery. The initial goal to immunize orally by ingestion of plant-derived antigens has proven difficult to attain, although many studies have demonstrated antibody production in both humans and animals, and in a few cases, protection against pathogen challenge. Substantial hurdles for this strategy are low-antigen content in crudely processed plant material and limited antigen stability in the gut. An alternative is intranasal delivery of purified plant-derived antigens expressed with robust viral vectors, especially virus-like particles. The use of pattern recognition receptor agonists as adjuvants for mucosal delivery of plant-derived antigens can substantially enhance serum and mucosal antibody responses. In this chapter, we briefly review the methods for recombinant protein expression in plants, and describe progress with human and animal vaccines that use mucosal delivery routes. We do not attempt to compile a comprehensive list, but focus on studies that progressed to clinical trials or those that showed strong indications of efficacy in animals. Finally, we discuss some regulatory concerns regarding plant-based vaccines.","publish_time":"2011-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mason, H. S.; Herbst-Kralovetz, M.

Mutations of KCNQ1 genes that result in reduction or loss of channel activity cause prolongation of repolarization during action potential, thereby causing long QT syndrome (LQTs). Small molecule activators of KCNQ1/KCNE1 are useful both for understanding the mechanism of the complex activity and for developing therapeutics for LQTs. In this study we report that hexachlorophene (HCP), the active component of the topical anti-infective prescription drug pHisoHex, is a KCNQ1/KCNE1 activator. HCP potently increases the current amplitude of KCNQ1/KCNE1 expressed by stabilizing the channel in an open state with an EC(50) of 4.61\u00B11.29 \u03BCM. Further studies in cardiomyocytes showed that HCP significantly shortens the action potential duration at 1 \u03BCM. In addition, HCP is capable of rescuing the loss of function of the LQTs mutants caused by either impaired activation gating or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding affinity. Our results indicate HCP is a novel KCNQ1/KCNE1 activator and may be a useful tool compound for the development of LQTs therapeutics.","publish_time":"2012-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Yueming; Zhu, Xuejing; Zhou, Pingzheng; Lan, Xi; Xu, Haiyan; Li, Min; Gao, Zhaobing","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5f986ded9c2caf03ce509dffc7e53f93f41941c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3520906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23251633/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051820","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCP","EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCP","coassembly of KCNQ1","novel KCNQ1","KCNE1 activator","current amplitude of KCNQ1","Mutations of KCNQ1 genes","repolarization of action potential","voltage-gated KCNQ1 potassium channel","Small molecule activators of KCNQ1","LQTs mutants","action potential duration","auxiliary KCNE1 subunit","development of LQTs therapeutics","cardiomyocytes","\u03BCM","loss of channel activity cause prolongation of repolarization","loss of function","complex activity","useful tool compound","topical anti-infective prescription drug pHisoHex","active component","reduction","cardiac tissues","bisphosphate","phosphatidylinositol","impaired activation gating","long QT syndrome","PIP2","binding affinity","open state","mechanism","hexachlorophene","results","study","addition","studies"],"language":"en"},

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using His(6)-tagged full-length and truncated proteins were employed to examine the nucleic acid binding properties of the GAV nucleocapsid (N) protein in vitro. The EMSAs showed full-length N protein to bind to all synthetic single-stranded (ss)RNAs tested independent of their sequence. The ssRNAs included (\u002B) and (\u2212) sense regions of the GAV genome as well as a (\u002B) sense region of the M RNA segment of Mourilyan virus, a crustacean bunya-like virus. GAV N protein also bound to double-stranded (ds)RNAs prepared to GAV ORF1b gene regions and to bacteriophage M13 genomic ssDNA. EMSAs using the five N protein constructs with variable-length N-terminal and/or C-terminal truncations localized the RNA binding domain to a 50 amino acid (aa) N-terminal sequence spanning Met(11) to Arg(60). Similarly to other RNA binding proteins, the first 16 aa portion of this sequence was proline/arginine rich. To examine this domain in more detail, the 18 aa peptide (M(11)PVRRPLPPQPPRNARLI(29)) encompassing this sequence was synthesized and found to bind nucleic acids similarly to the full-length N protein in EMSAs. The data indicate a fundamental role for the GAV N protein proline/arginine-rich domain in nucleating genomic ssRNA to form nucleocapsids. Moreover, as the synthetic peptide formed higher-order complexes in the presence of RNA, the domain might also play some role in protein/protein interactions stabilizing the helical structure of GAV nucleocapsids.","publish_time":"2011-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soowannayan, Chumporn; Cowley, Jeff A.; Michalski, Wojtek P.; Walker, Peter J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eaf46f27d9c28f8b3c818b0d7969d9188a7e9c11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3153931.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21857914/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GAV","GAV N","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["full-length N protein","GAV N protein proline","N protein constructs","N-terminal sequence","protein interactions","GAV genome","EMSAs","RNA binding domain","variable-length N-terminal","RNA binding proteins","GAV ORF1b gene regions","helical structure of GAV nucleocapsids","arginine-rich domain","presence of RNA","aa peptide","RNA segment of Mourilyan virus","arginine rich","nucleic acid binding properties","sense regions","aa portion","synthetic peptide","C-terminal truncations","Gill-associated virus","amino acid","fundamental role","genomic ssRNA","synthetic single","nucleic acids","truncated proteins","bacteriophage M13 genomic ssDNA","Penaeus monodon shrimp","higher-order complexes","Roniviridae","type species okavirus","double","crustacean bunya","Electrophoretic mobility shift assays","Met","invertebrate nidoviruses","data","PVRRPLPPQPPRNARLI","ssRNAs"],"language":"en"},

We demonstrated recently that uremia triggers the development of highly pro-atherogenic monocytes via an angiotensin II (AngII)\u2013dependent mechanism. Opposing actions of the AngII-degrading ACE2 remain largely unknown. We examined the status of both ACEs and related receptors in circulating leukocytes of HD, not-dialyzed CKD and healthy individuals. Furthermore, we tested the possible impact of monocytic ACEs on atherogenesis and behaviour of the cells under conditions mimicking chronic renal failure. Methods: Expression of ACE, ACE2, AT1R, AT2R and MASR was investigated on circulating leukocytes from 71 HD (62 \u00B1 14 years), 24 CKD stage 3\u20135 (74 \u00B1 10 years) patients and 37 healthy control subjects (53 \u00B1 6 years) and isolated healthy monocytes treated with normal and uremic serum. Analyses of ACE, ACE2, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MCSF and endothelial adhesion were tested on ACE-overexpressing THP-1 monocytes treated with captopril or losartan. ACE2-overexpressing monocytes were subjected to transmigration and adhesion assays and investigated for MCP-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MCSF, AT1R and AT2R expression. Results: The ACE mRNA level was significantly increased in HD and CKD stage 3\u20135 leukocytes. Correspondingly, ACE2 was downregulated and AngII as well as MAS receptor expression was upregulated in these cells. Healthy monocytes preconditioned with uremic serum reflected the same expressional regulation of ACE/ACE2, MAS and AngII receptors as those observed in HD and CKD stage 3\u20135 leukocytes. Overexpression of monocytic ACE dramatically decreased levels of ACE2 and induced a pro-atherogenic phenotype, partly reversed by AngII-modifying treatments, leading to an increase in ACE2. Overexpression of ACE2 in monocytes led to reduced endothelial adhesion, transmigration and downregulation of adhesion-related molecules. Conclusions: HD and not-dialyzed CKD stage 3\u20135 patients show enhanced ACE and decreased ACE2 expression on monocytes. This constellation renders the cells endothelial adhesive and likely supports the development of atherosclerosis.","publish_time":"2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trojanowicz, Bogusz; Ulrich, Christof; Kohler, Felix; Bode, Veronika; Seibert, Eric; Fiedler, Roman; Girndt, Matthias","journal":"Nephrol Dial Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60561f0e1a02c6d005c857bfb1f96e7df5d2b0cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108029.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfw206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28186543/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MASR","ACE","CKD","MAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2-overexpressing monocytes","levels of ACE2","Overexpression of ACE2","decreased ACE2 expression","enhanced ACE","Analyses of ACE","Overexpression of monocytic ACE","isolated healthy monocytes","circulating leukocytes of HD","pro-atherogenic monocytes","ACE-overexpressing THP","dialyzed CKD stage","endothelial adhesion","AngII receptors","expressional regulation of ACE","ACE mRNA level","patients","AT2R expression","years","downregulation of adhesion","adhesion assays","healthy individuals","cells endothelial adhesive","MAS receptor expression","Increased levels of monocytic angiotensin","related receptors","transmigration","AT1R","uremic serum","healthy control subjects","VCAM","MCSF","ICAM","development of atherosclerosis","possible impact of monocytic ACEs","pro-atherogenic phenotype","related molecules","pathogenesis of atherosclerosis","atherogenesis","conditions","behaviour","enzyme","MASR","chronic renal failure","Background","haemodialysis","captopril","Results","MCP","status","constellation","Methods","dependent mechanism","uremia","treatments","losartan","Conclusions","actions"],"language":"en"},

Non\u2010randomized studies suggest that convalescent plasma appears useful as add\u2010on therapy for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza A(H5N1), and influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic [A(H1N1)pdm09), but it is limited by its availability. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing hyperimmune globulin prepared from convalescent plasma against normal intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) manufactured before 2009 as control in patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection on standard antiviral treatment has shown that the hyperimmune globulin group who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset had a lower viral load and reduced mortality compared with the controls. A number of agents with immunomodulatory effects (e.g. acute use of statins, N\u2010acetylcysteine, macrolides, PPAR agonists, IVIG, celecoxib, mesalazine) have been proposed for influenza management. However, more animal and detailed human observational studies and preferably RCTs controlling for the effects of antiviral therapy and disease severity are needed for evaluating these agents.

The role of one such variable, population density, in the spread of influenza is controversial. Prior studies have tested for such a role using arbitrary thresholds for population density above or below which places are hypothesized to have higher or lower mortality. The results of such studies are mixed. The objective of this study is to estimate, rather than assume, a threshold level of population density that separates low-density regions from high-density regions on the basis of population loss during an influenza pandemic. We study the case of the influenza pandemic of 1918\u201319 in India, where over 15 million people died in the short span of less than one year. METHODS: Using data from six censuses for 199 districts of India (n=1194), the country with the largest number of deaths from the influenza of 1918\u201319, we use a sample-splitting method embedded within a population growth model that explicitly quantifies population loss from the pandemic to estimate a threshold level of population density that separates low-density districts from high-density districts. RESULTS: The results demonstrate a threshold level of population density of 175 people per square mile. A concurrent finding is that districts on the low side of the threshold experienced rates of population loss (3.72%) that were lower than districts on the high side of the threshold (4.69%). CONCLUSIONS: This paper introduces a useful analytic tool to the health geographic literature. It illustrates an application of the tool to demonstrate that it can be useful for pandemic awareness and preparedness efforts. Specifically, it estimates a level of population density above which policies to socially distance, redistribute or quarantine populations are likely to be more effective than they are for areas with population densities that lie below the threshold.","publish_time":"2013-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chandra, Siddharth; Kassens-Noor, Eva; Kuljanin, Goran; Vertalka, Joshua","journal":"Int J Health Geogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac379a37c74e9e9ea13ad9813f46f53dbab62b66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3641965.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-072x-12-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23425498/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["threshold level of population density","population densities","basis of population loss","threshold experienced rates of population loss","population growth model","influenza pandemic","low-density districts","high-density districts","districts of India","results","pandemic awareness","spread of influenza","low-density regions","high-density regions","important role","people","study of epidemics","useful analytic tool","Geographic variables","lower mortality","Prior studies","health geographic literature","country","largest number of deaths","paper","distance","preparedness efforts","censuses","arbitrary thresholds","policies","sample-splitting method","quarantine populations","square mile","short span","BACKGROUND","data","areas","places","concurrent finding","year","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","case","application","objective"],"language":"en"},

The environmental survival and persistence of nucleic acid associated with these viral agents may be important for both the detection as well as the occurrence of related diseases. Our hypothesis suggests that nucleic acid from such emerging viruses may enter into a virus-parasite surrogate relationship to aid in viral persistence. We suggest that Cryptosporidium and other gastrointestinal parasites, including Giardia, could be a) a reservoir of genetic material and a environment where assortment between that genetic variation can occur and, b) a source of zoonoses through infection of the \u2018target\u2019 animal (including humans). One example which illustrates this may be the uptake dsRNA from rotavirus into cryptosporidial oocysts, as this parasite has previously been shown to contain dsRNA viral-like particles.

Fecal samples from 482 cats, approximately half of the cats with normal fecal consistency and half with diarrhea, were tested by zinc sulfate centrifugation and by real-time PCR for a panel of enteropathogens. At least one enteropathogen of feline or zoonotic importance was detected in a majority of cats, regardless of management model. For most enteropathogens, the presence or absence of diarrhea was not significantly associated with infection, the exceptions being Tritrichomonas foetus in sanctuary cats with diarrhea (26%) and normal fecal consistency (10%), respectively (P \u22640.04), and feline coronavirus in foster cats (80% and 58%) (P \u22640.001). The types of enteropathogens detected were related to the type of management model, e.g., viral and protozoal infections were most common in shelters, sanctuaries, and foster homes (confinement systems), whereas helminth infections were most common in trap-neuter-return programs (free-roaming cats). These results suggest that management practices for unowned cats are inadequate for control of enteropathogens and that the presence of diarrhea is a poor indicator of enteropathogen carriage.

AMPPNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, competitively inhibited RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity. Analogies of mutational effects on the two activities and approximation of K i(AMPPNP) and K m(ATP) suggest that the catalytic sites of the activities are overlapped.

We thus undertook systematic reviews based on key questions (KQs) using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format. The KQs were: Among children with chronic cough (\u003E 4 weeks) after acute viral bronchiolitis, how effective are the following interventions in improving the resolution of cough?: (1) Antibiotics. If so what type and for how long? (2) Asthma medications (inhaled steroids, beta2 agonist, montelukast); and (3) Inhaled osmotic agents like hypertonic saline? Methods We used the CHEST expert cough panel\u2019s protocol and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and GRADE framework. Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients\u2019 values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form these suggestions. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus. Results Several studies and systematic reviews on the efficacy of the three types of interventions listed in the introduction were found but no data were relevant to our KQs. Thus, no recommendations on using the interventions above could be formulated. Conclusions The panel made several consensus-based suggestions and identified directions for future studies to advance the field of managing chronic cough post-acute bronchiolitis in children.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Anne B.; Oppenheimer, John J.; Rubin, Bruce K.; Weinberger, Miles; Irwin, Richard S.; Adams, Todd M.; Altman, Kenneth W.; Azoulay, Elie; Barker, Alan F.; Birring, Surinder S.; Blackhall, Fiona; Bolser, Donald C.; Boulet, Louis-Philippe; Braman, Sidney S.; Brightling, Christopher; Callahan-Lyon, Priscilla; Cowley, Terrie; Davenport, Paul; Ebihara, Satoru; El Solh, Ali A.; Escalante, Patricio; Field, Stephen K.; Fisher, Dina; French, Cynthia T.; Gibson, Peter; Gold, Philip; Harding, Susan M.; Harnden, Anthony; Hill, Adam T.; Kahrilas, Peter J.; Kavanagh, Joanne; Keogh, Karina A.; Lai, Kefang; Lane, Andrew P.; Lim, Kaiser; Madison, J.

Nsp3 is an essential component of the replication/transcription complex. It comprises various domains, the organization of which differs between CoV genera, due to duplication or absence of some domains. However, eight domains of Nsp3 exist in all known CoVs: the ubiquitin-like domain 1 (Ubl1), the Glu-rich acidic domain (also called \u201Chypervariable region\u201D), a macrodomain (also named \u201CX domain\u201D), the ubiquitin-like domain 2 (Ubl2), the papain-like protease 2 (PL2pro), the Nsp3 ectodomain (3Ecto, also called \u201Czinc-finger domain\u201D), as well as the domains Y1 and CoV-Y of unknown functions. In addition, the two transmembrane regions, TM1 and TM2, exist in all CoVs. The three-dimensional structures of domains in the N-terminal two thirds of Nsp3 have been investigated by X-ray crystallography and/or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy since the outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 as well as Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. In this review, the structures and functions of these domains of Nsp3 are discussed in depth.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Jian; Kusov, Yuri; Hilgenfeld, Rolf","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8df5060637cad60d903a4c41eb7a3f13b96ad35c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113668.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128390/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217303972; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217303972; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.11.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Middle-East Respiratory"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["domains of Nsp3","Nsp3 ectodomain","thirds of Nsp3","X domain","domains Y1","various domains","SARS-CoV","CoV-Y","MERS-CoV","CoV genera","three-dimensional structures of domains","zinc-finger domain","multi-domain non-structural protein","Glu-rich acidic domain","ubiquitin","Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","unknown functions","largest protein","known CoVs","spectroscopy","nuclear magnetic resonance","NMR","genome","N-terminal","essential component","X-ray crystallography","average molecular mass","transmembrane regions","replication","TM2","PL2pro","macrodomain","Ubl1","organization","duplication","transcription complex","hypervariable region","papain","TM1","kD","absence","Ubl2","protease","addition","review","depth"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We included consecutive hospitalized elderly individuals suspected of having pneumonia. At inclusion, NPS were collected from all participants and tested by PCR for the presence of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens (index test, defined as comprehensive molecular testing). Routine diagnostic tests (blood and sputum culture, urine antigen detection) were also performed. The reference standard was the presence of pneumonia on a low-dose CT scan as assessed by two independent expert radiologists. RESULTS: The diagnosis of pneumonia was confirmed in 127 of 199 (64%) included patients (mean age 83 years, community-acquired pneumonia in 105 (83%)). A pathogen was identified by comprehensive molecular testing in 114 patients (57%) and by routine methods in 22 (11%). Comprehensive molecular testing was positive for viruses in 62 patients (31%) and for bacteria in 73 (37%). The sensitivity and specificity were 61% (95% CI 53%\u201369%) and 50% (95% CI 39%\u201361%) for comprehensive molecular testing, and 14% (95% CI 82%\u201321%) and 94% (95% CI 86%\u201398%) for routine testing, respectively. Positive likelihood ratio was 2.55 for routine methods and 1.23 for comprehensive molecular testing. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive molecular testing of NPS increases the number of pathogens detected compared with routine methods, but results are poorly predictive of the presence of pneumonia. Hence, comprehensive molecular testing is unlikely to impact clinical decision-making (NCT02467192).

We compared the codon adaptation of DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) genotypes from urban and sylvatic habitats and tried to correlate the findings with key evolutionary determinants. We found that DENV-2 codons of urban and sylvatic genotypes had a higher CAI to humans than to Ae. aegypti. Remarkably, we found no significant differences in codon adaptation to human between urban American/Asian and sylvatic DENV-2 genotypes. Moreover, CAI values were significantly different, when comparing all genotypes to Ae. aegypti codon preferences, with lower values for sylvatic than urban genotypes. In summary, our findings suggest the presence of a molecular signature among the genotypes that circulate in sylvatic and urban environments, and may help explain the trafficking of DENV-2 strains to an urban cycle.","publish_time":"2018-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"dos Passos Cunha, Marielton; Ortiz-Baez, Ayda Susana; de Melo Freire, Caio C\u00E9sar; de Andrade Zanotto, Paolo Marinho","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c871abcf76a32293c79488b26d82b4fdf5cd8209.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106335.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818302983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29792991/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.05.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818302983","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","CAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["urban genotypes","sylvatic DENV","sylvatic genotypes","urban American","codons of urban","urban cycle","urban environments","sylvatic environment","sylvatic habitats","codon adaptation of DENV serotype","trafficking of DENV","human-Aedes","colonized urban settings","aegypti codon preferences","viral adaptation","viral codon usage","human transmission chain","CAI values","findings","anthropophilic species Aedes aegypti","lower values","higher CAI","bites of females","presence","evidence","fine-tuning","humans","strains","significant differences","molecular signature","key evolutionary determinants","summary","Dengue virus"],"language":"en"},

All MHV DI RNAs characterized so far contain an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a fused viral protein; in addition, DI RNAs with a long ORF have a competitive advantage over those with a shorter ORF. These findings suggest that DI RNA replication may require an ORF encoding a cis-acting viral protein. In this study, we used a naturally occurring DI RNA and inserted a 12-nucleotide (nt) amber-mutation linker at various positions to truncate the ORF. Most of the mutants replicated as well as the wild-type DI RNA, irrespective of the presence or absence and the length of the ORF in the RNA. Sequence analysis showed that all of the mutants retained the insertional mutations even after two viral passages in tissue culture, establishing that the mutant DI RNAs replicated. We have further introduced two 3-nucleotide substitutions of the first two AUG codons of the ORF, thus completely closing the ORF. This DI RNA replicated as well as the wild-type DL but, after a single passage, the majority of the mutant RNAs was replaced by recombinant RNAs which contain a restored functional ORF. However, an additional insertion of a 12-nt amber-mutation linker downstream of the AUG substitutions prevented recombination, and the DI RNA still replicated. These data indicate that DI RNA replication does not require a DI-specific ORF encoding cis-acting viral proteins and that a 12-nucleotide insertion could prevent or delay the occurrence of RNA recombination, suggesting the importance of direct or indirect RNA alignment in homologous RNA recombination.","publish_time":"1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Ching-Len; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682285712755; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285712755","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","DI RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DI RNA replication","DI-specific ORF","mutant DI RNAs","MHV DI RNAs","wild-type DI RNA","long ORF","shorter ORF","homologous RNA recombination","occurrence of RNA recombination","mutant RNAs","indirect RNA alignment","restored functional ORF","recombinant RNAs","viral passages","RNAs of different sizes","viral proteins","nucleotide substitutions","nucleotide insertion","fused viral protein","nt amber-mutation linker","mutants","additional insertion","importance of direct","various positions","competitive advantage","high multiplicities of infection","defective-interfering","tissue culture","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus","coronavirus","majority","insertional mutations","length","presence","open reading frame","single passage","absence","findings","data","codons","Sequence analysis","study"],"language":"en"},

Equally informative are comparisons of the response of viral populations when subjected to different passage r\u00E9gimens.

The replication of three different MHV strains was studied in mouse dissociated spinal cord cultures containing differentiated neurons and nonneuronal cells (NN) (including astrocytes). Cell tropism and maturation of each virus strain was analyzed by immunolabeling methods using antisera to the virion or to purified membrane glycoproteins (E1 and E2) and by electron microscopy (EM). Wt-JHM, which causes acute encephalitis in mice, produces acute cytopathic changes in both neurons and NN cells. In neurons, virions mature in smooth ER cisternae closely associated to the Golgi apparatus. As judged by EM, fewer virions are produced by neurons than NN cells and neurons do not fuse or stain for E2 as do NN cells. NN cells contain large inclusions made of nucleocapsid strands. A temperature-sensitive mutant of JHM, Ts8-JHM, which causes demyelination in mice, infects NN cells but not neurons. Infected NN cells synthesize E1 and E2, and contain large inclusions but few mature virions, even at permissive temperatures. These inclusions appear granular and rarely contain nucleocapsid strands in contrast to wt-JHM infection. NN cells infected with this mutant also display numerous membrane whorls. The hepatotropic strain A59 lacks tropism for neurons and primarily infects NN cells, thus resembling ts8-JHM. Infected NN cells become loaded with intracytoplasmic virions which are secreted from the cells. E1 can only be detected in the perinuclear area of these cells while E2 rapidly spreads throughout the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of A59 infected NN cells frequently contains large tubular structures often in the lumen of the RER. In conclusion, in primary CNS cultures consisting of neurons and NN cells: (1) wt-JHM replicates in both neurons and NN cells but has different effects on these cells; (2) Ts8-JHM exhibits no productive infection of neurons, and in NN cells appears to be defective in assembly and to stimulate membrane synthesis; (3) A59 also shows tropism restricted to NN cells which produce many viruses and display differential distribution of the two virion glycoproteins. Thus, in the absence of the immune system, the MHV strains assayed exhibit differences in viral tropism, cytopathic changes, and viral assembly in CNS cells, and these differences may account for the different disease patterns.","publish_time":"1982-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dubois-Dalcq, Monique E.; Doller, Elizabeth W.; Haspel, Martin V.; Holmes, Kathryn V.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdde28b1d92e7838d9fcf80a8ead83cf193db82a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682282900927; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682282900927","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NN","RER","CNS","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS cells","nonneuronal cells","cytoplasm of A59 infected NN cells","differentiated neurons","productive infection of neurons","E2","wt-JHM infection","resembling ts8-JHM","wt-JHM replicates","viral tropism","mice","large inclusions","mature virions","E1","temperature-sensitive mutant of JHM","different MHV strains","intracytoplasmic virions","Cell tropism","fewer virions","membrane glycoproteins","acute cytopathic changes","viral assembly","hepatotropic strain A59","nucleocapsid strands","different effects","virion glycoproteins","membrane synthesis","large tubular structures","primary CNS cultures","numerous membrane whorls","different disease patterns","exhibit differences","acute encephalitis","virus strain","Abstract Mouse hepatitis viruses","immune system","spinal cord cultures","central nervous system","coronaviruses","intestine","lung","immunolabeling methods","various infections","contrast","smooth ER cisternae","demyelination","organs","liver","lumen","differential distribution","maturation","stain","electron microscopy","antisera","conclusion","permissive temperatures","replication","perinuclear area","Golgi apparatus","absence","astrocytes","RER"],"language":"en"},

This study is undertaken to develop an efficient computational approach for timely encoding protein sequences and extracting the hidden information. METHODS: Based on two physicochemical properties of amino acids, a protein primary sequence was converted into a three-letter sequence, and then a graph without loops and multiple edges and its geometric line adjacency matrix were obtained. A generalized PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) model was thus constructed to characterize a protein sequence numerically. RESULTS: By using the proposed mathematical descriptor of a protein sequence, similarity comparisons among \u03B2-globin proteins of 17 species and 72 spike proteins of coronaviruses were made, respectively. The resulting clusters agreed well with the established taxonomic groups. In addition, a generalized PseAAC based SVM (support vector machine) model was developed to identify DNA-binding proteins. Experiment results showed that our method performed better than DNAbinder, DNA-Prot, iDNA-Prot and enDNA-Prot by 3.29-10.44% in terms of ACC, 0.056-0.206 in terms of MCC, and 1.45-15.76% in terms of F1M. When the benchmark dataset was expanded with negative samples, the presented approach outperformed the four previous methods with improvement in the range of 2.49-19.12% in terms of ACC, 0.05-0.32 in terms of MCC, and 3.82-33.85% in terms of F1M. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that the generalized PseAAC model was very efficient for comparison and analysis of protein sequences, and very competitive in identifying DNA-binding proteins.","publish_time":"2018-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chun; Zhao, Jialing; Wang, Changzhong; Yao, Yuhua","journal":"Comb Chem High Throughput Screen","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b4bdc3dce8169c30fd1f151713b1f801059c694.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5930480.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29380690/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1386207321666180130100838","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein primary sequence","terms of ACC","terms of MCC","terms of F1M","analysis of protein sequences","generalized PseAAC model","letter sequence","DNA-binding proteins","protein sequence data available leads","timely encoding protein sequences","efficient computational approach","iDNA-Prot","\u03B2-globin proteins","enDNA-Prot","spike proteins of coronaviruses","Experiment results","presented approach","previous methods","novel computational algorithms","pseudo amino acid composition","physicochemical properties of amino acids","urgent need","SVM","multiple edges","similarity comparisons","species","support vector machine","geometric line adjacency matrix","negative samples","graph","proposed mathematical descriptor","rapid increase","loops","DNAbinder","hidden information","established taxonomic groups","benchmark dataset","AIM","OBJECTIVE","improvement","range","addition","resulting clusters","study","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In other cases of glomerulonephritis, when infection is clinically silent, viral syndromes can still be implicated as a trigger. However, strong evidence for viral causality in most glomerular disease is still lacking. While numerous case reports in children document the occurrence of specific forms of glomerular disease after seroconversion to a wide range of viruses, relatively few reports provide pathologic evidence of viral infection associated with glomerular lesions on kidney biopsy. Strong associations between hepatitis viruses and glomerular injury have been acknowledged in adults, but hepatitis C virus appears not to be an etiology in children. In the context of treating glomerular diseases, when diagnosed, the treatment of hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus and human immunodeficiency virus in children with membranoproliferative, membranous and collapsing glomerulopathy plays an important role. Otherwise, there is no evidence suggesting that the identification of a viral infection in a child with glomerulopathy should change the management of the infection or the glomerulonephritis.

Metagenomic next generation sequencing can identify unusual or novel microbes and is therefore well suited for investigating the etiology of chronic meningoencephalitis in immunodeficient patients. METHODS: We present the case of a 34\u2010year\u2010old man with X\u2010linked agammaglobulinemia from Australia suffering from 3 years of meningoencephalitis that defied an etiologic diagnosis despite extensive conventional testing, including a brain biopsy. Metagenomic next generation sequencing of his cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy tissue was performed to identify a causative pathogen. RESULTS: Sequences aligning to multiple Cache Valley virus genes were identified via metagenomic next generation sequencing. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry subsequently confirmed the presence of Cache Valley virus in the brain biopsy tissue. INTERPRETATION: Cache Valley virus, a mosquito\u2010borne orthobunyavirus, has only been identified in 3 immunocompetent North American patients with acute neuroinvasive disease. The reported severity ranges from a self\u2010limiting meningitis to a rapidly fatal meningoencephalitis with multiorgan failure. The virus has never been known to cause a chronic systemic or neurologic infection in humans. Cache Valley virus has also never previously been detected on the Australian continent. Our research subject traveled to North and South Carolina and Michigan in the weeks prior to the onset of his illness. This report demonstrates that metagenomic next generation sequencing allows for unbiased pathogen identification, the early detection of emerging viruses as they spread to new locales, and the discovery of novel disease phenotypes.

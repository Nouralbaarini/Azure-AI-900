Accordingly, the development of efficient antiviral therapies is a major goal and a challenge for the scientific community, as we are still far from understanding the molecular mechanisms that operate after virus infection. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) plays an important antiviral role during viral infection. ISG15 catalyzes a ubiquitin-like post-translational modification termed ISGylation, involving the conjugation of ISG15 molecules to de novo synthesized viral or cellular proteins, which regulates their stability and function. Numerous biomedically relevant viruses are targets of ISG15, as well as proteins involved in antiviral immunity. Beyond their role as cellular powerhouses, mitochondria are multifunctional organelles that act as signaling hubs in antiviral responses. In this review, we give an overview of the biological consequences of ISGylation for virus infection and host defense. We also compare several published proteomic studies to identify and classify potential mitochondrial ISGylation targets. Finally, based on our recent observations, we discuss the essential functions of mitochondria in the antiviral response and examine the role of ISG15 in the regulation of mitochondrial processes, specifically OXPHOS and mitophagy.","publish_time":"2018-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albert, Manuel; B\u00E9cares, Martina; Falqui, Michela; Fern\u00E1ndez-Lozano, Carlos; Guerra, Susana","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94cad8eb2f7ef7b18edd43115de077da98425871.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6265978.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v10110629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of ISG15","important antiviral role","antiviral responses","antiviral immunity","virus infection","viral infection","conjugation of ISG15 molecules","development of efficient antiviral therapies","potential mitochondrial ISGylation targets","cellular proteins","biological consequences of ISGylation","cellular powerhouses","essential functions of mitochondria","regulation of mitochondrial processes","Numerous biomedically relevant viruses","novo","major goal","hemorrhagic fevers","HIV","AIDS","multifunctional organelles","majority of infectious diseases","post-translational modification","devastating effects","challenge","OXPHOS","overview","hubs","ubiquitin","host defense","human population","published proteomic studies","mitophagy","stability","Interferon-stimulated gene","molecular mechanisms","scientific community","recent observations","review"],"language":"en"},

A multitude of research efforts focuses on the improvement of established and the discovery of new vaccines such as the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine in 2006. However, radical changes in the density, age distribution and traveling habits of the population worldwide as well as the changing climate favor the emergence of old and new pathogens that bear the risk of becoming pandemic threats. In recent years, the rapid spread of severe infections such as HIV, SARS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the dire need for global preparedness for pandemics, which necessitates the extremely rapid development and comprehensive distribution of vaccines against potentially previously unknown pathogens. What is more, the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria calls for new approaches to prevent infections. Given these changes, established methods for the identification of new vaccine candidates are no longer sufficient to ensure global protection. Hence, new vaccine technologies able to achieve rapid development as well as large scale production are of pivotal importance. This review will discuss viral vector and nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA and mRNA vaccines) as new approaches that might be able to tackle these challenges to global health.","publish_time":"2018-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rauch, Susanne; Jasny, Edith; Schmidt, Kim E.; Petsch, Benjamin","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ad6ccc77d12ec8c8f91076fd337a01d734e578e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6156540.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283434/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new approaches","new pathogens","discovery of new vaccines","new vaccine technologies able","rapid development","identification of new vaccine candidates","mRNA vaccines","comprehensive distribution of vaccines","global preparedness","global health","global protection","nucleic acid-based vaccines","rapid spread of severe infections","age distribution","emergence of old","restriction of diseases","radical changes","recent years","unknown pathogens","established methods","burden of infectious diseases","emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria","DNA","HPV","large scale production","viral vector","SARS","HIV","dire need","density","pandemics","human papilloma virus","Zika","pivotal importance","tetanus","polio","habits","risk","changing climate","improvement","diphtheria","Ebola","review","eradication of small pox","population","challenges","multitude of research efforts","pandemic threats","measles","vaccinations"],"language":"en"},

Humoral immune response depression is due to perturbation of soluble factors, as complement and chemokines in innate immunity and antibodies or cytokines in adaptive immunity. At the cellular immune response, immunosuppression is the consequence of the dysfunction of T-cells, B-cells, heterophils, monocytes, macrophages, and natural Killer cells. Immunosuppression in turkeys can be caused by numerous, non-infectious, and infectious agents, having variable pathological and molecular mechanisms. Interactions between them are very complex. This paper reviews the common viruses inducing clinical and sub-clinical immunosuppression in turkeys, and enteric and neoplastic viruses in particular, as well as the interactions among them. The evaluation of immunosuppression is currently based on classical approach; however, new technique such as the microarray technology is being developed to investigate immunological mediator\u2019s genes detection. Controlling of immunosuppression include, in general, biosecurity practices, maintaining appropriate breeding conditions and vaccination of breeders and their progeny.

METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of literature published in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) from January 1, 2002 to March 15, 2020. All statistical analyses in this study were performed on stata14.0. RESULTS: A total of 5270 patients from 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis.

Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory test results, and final outcomes of COVID-19 treatment were collected and analyzed. Results A total of 132 patients were included and divided into three groups based on their blood glucose status. There were significant differences in SaO2, serum ferritin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (Fbg) level, and IL6 level among the three groups. A pairwise comparison of the groups showed that groups B and C were significantly different from group A in terms of CRP, ESR, and Fbg, IL6, and serum ferritin levels (P \u003C 0.05).

With novel emerging infectious diseases being reported across different parts of the world, there is a need to build systems that can track, monitor and report such events in a timely manner. Further, it is also important to identify susceptible geographic regions and populations where emerging diseases may have a significant impact. METHODS: In this paper, we present an overview of Oak Ridge Biosurveillance Toolkit (ORBiT), which we have developed specifically to address data analytic challenges in the realm of public health surveillance. In particular, ORBiT provides an extensible environment to pull together diverse, large-scale datasets and analyze them to identify spatial and temporal patterns for various biosurveillance-related tasks. RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of ORBiT in automatically extracting a small number of spatial and temporal patterns during the 2009-2010 pandemic H1N1 flu season using claims data. These patterns provide quantitative insights into the dynamics of how the pandemic flu spread across different parts of the country. We discovered that the claims data exhibits multi-scale patterns from which we could identify a small number of states in the United States (US) that act as \u0022bridge regions\u0022 contributing to one or more specific influenza spread patterns. Similar to previous studies, the patterns show that the south-eastern regions of the US were widely affected by the H1N1 flu pandemic. Several of these south-eastern states act as bridge regions, which connect the north-east and central US in terms of flu occurrences. CONCLUSIONS: These quantitative insights show how the claims data combined with novel analytical techniques can provide important information to decision makers when an epidemic spreads throughout the country. Taken together ORBiT provides a scalable and extensible platform for public health surveillance.","publish_time":"2015-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramanathan, Arvind; Pullum, Laura L; Hobson, Tanner C; Steed, Chad A; Quinn, Shannon P; Chennubhotla, Chakra S; Valkova, Silvia","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e0fdaf23e6de0d6787519f671bc198d47f3acb1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4674898.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26679008/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-16-s17-s4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["claims data","temporal patterns","pandemic flu","digitization of health","H1N1 flu pandemic","bridge regions","south-eastern regions","electronic health records","multi-scale patterns","related information","important information","realm of public health surveillance","pandemic H1N1 flu season","south-eastern states","utility of ORBiT","data analytic challenges","small number of states","continued growth of self-reported health information","electronic healthcare reimbursement claims","emerging diseases","central US","small number of spatial","different parts","United States","susceptible geographic regions","terms of flu occurrences","quantitative insights","country","novel emerging infectious diseases","various biosurveillance-related tasks","effective biosurveillance tools","extensible platform","extensible environment","overview of Oak Ridge Biosurveillance Toolkit","novel analytical techniques","EHR","social media","tremendous opportunities","decision makers","populations","dynamics","epidemic spreads","large-scale datasets","world","significant impact","previous studies","events","timely manner","need","paper","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","specific influenza","systems","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) have the highest sensitivity and specificity to investigate virus contamination in water, so they are the most commonly used in environmental virology. Despite great sensitivity of PCR, the main limitation is the lack of the correlation between the detected viral genome and viral infectivity, which limits conclusions regarding the significance for public health. To provide information about the infectivity of the detected viruses, cultivation on animal cell culture is the gold standard. However, cell culture infectivity assays are laborious, time consuming and costly. Also, not all viruses are able to produce cytopathic effect and viruses such as human noroviruses have no available cell line for propagation. In this brief review, we present a summary and critical evaluation of different approaches that have been recently proposed to overcome limitations of the traditional cell culture assay and PCR assay such as integrated cell culture-PCR, detection of genome integrity, detection of capsid integrity, and measurement of oxidative damages on viral capsid protein. Techniques for rapid detection of infectious viruses such as fluorescence microscopy and automated flow cytometry have also been suggested to assess virus infectivity in water samples.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hamza, Ibrahim Ahmed; Jurzik, Lars; \u00DCberla, Klaus; Wilhelm, Michael","journal":"International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e45d0ab19f02503c0e65d0bb46dcf63be426e6fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106513.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920815/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463911001349; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463911001349; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2011.07.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["integrated cell culture-PCR","PCR assay","virus detection","cell culture infectivity assays","viral infectivity","virus infectivity","animal cell culture","traditional cell culture assay","detected viruses","detection of genome integrity","detection of capsid integrity","available cell line","great sensitivity of PCR","rapid detection of infectious viruses","detected viral genome","environmental water samples","quantitative real time PCR","viral capsid protein","virus contamination","time consuming","Molecular methods","highest sensitivity","environmental virology","wide range of analytical methods","measurement of oxidative damages","fluorescence microscopy","human noroviruses","summary","polymerase chain reaction","qPCR","cultivation","cytopathic effect","main limitation","conclusions","correlation","specificity","automated flow cytometry","critical evaluation of different approaches","lack","Techniques","gold standard","limitations","significance","public health","propagation","brief review","information"],"language":"en"},

Even though COVID-19 infection may be just severe in any adults, older adults (65-year-old or older) may experience a higher mortality rate. Among those affected, cancer patients may have a worse outcome compared to the general population because of their depressed immune status. As the health resources of most countries are limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if they require artificial ventilation. Cancer patients, especially the older ones, may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy. Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment. The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of infection. (2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected. (3) Social services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers. (4) Close monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression. (5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection. (6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur. (7) Home health care telemedicine may be an effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid hospital admission when health care resources become restricted. (8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Nam P; Vinh-Hung, Vincent; Baumert, Brigitta; Zamagni, Alice; Arenas, Meritxell; Motta, Micaela; Lara, Pedro Carlos; Myint, Arthur Sun; Bonet, Marta; Popescu, Tiberiu; Vuong, Te; Appalanaido, Gokula Kumar; Trigo, Lurdes; Karlsson, Ulf; Thariat, Juliette","journal":"Cancers","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12051287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438703/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Education"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of older cancer patients","Enrollment of older cancer patients","special needs of older cancer patients","selected patients","older adults","cancer treatment","cancer centers","older ones","risks of infection","health care resources","health resources","COVID","supportive care","Education of health care providers","Home health care telemedicine","adequate social support","social distancing","daily transportation","clinical trials","Social services","special considerations","countries","targeted therapy","patient family","psychological support","patient navigators","systemic therapy of choice","adequate medical supply","Shorter course of radiotherapy","shorter life expectancy","telecommunication","effective strategy","general population","food","potential antiviral medications","hospital admission","phone calls","use of hypofractionation","surgical masks","worse outcome","depressed immune status","Close monitoring","record short period of time","world","anxiety","immunotherapy","exposure","separate scheduling","clinicians","depression","painful decisions","year-old","higher mortality rate","coronavirus disease","pandemic","artificial ventilation","following proposal"],"language":"en"},

There is a large body of existing literature, much of which is already in review form. In order to advance the usefulness of the literature for nurse and human resource managers, we undertook an overview (review of systematic reviews). The aim of the overview was to identify high quality evidence of the determinants and consequences of turnover in adult nursing. METHODS: Reviews were identified which were published between 1990 and January 2015 in English using electronic databases (the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, CINAHL plus and SCOPUS) and forward searching. All stages of the review were conducted in parallel by two reviewers. Reviews were quality appraised using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews and their findings narratively synthesised. RESULTS: Nine reviews were included. We found that the current evidence is incomplete and has a number of important limitations. However, a body of moderate quality review evidence does exist giving a picture of multiple determinants of turnover in adult nursing, with - at the individual level - nurse stress and dissatisfaction being important factors and -at the organisational level - managerial style and supervisory support factors holding most weight. The consequences of turnover are only described in economic terms, but are considered significant. CONCLUSIONS: In making a quality assessment of the review as well as considering the quality of the included primary studies and specificity in the outcomes they measure, the overview found that the evidence is not as definitive as previously presented from individual reviews. Further research is required, of rigorous research design, whether quantitative or qualitative, particularly against the outcome of actual turnover as opposed to intention to leave.

Acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD) is commonly associated with upper and lower respiratory viral infections and may result in respiratory failure in those with advanced lung disease. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the mechanism underlying COPD exacerbation, and host response to pathogen-derived factors. METHODS: Over a 24 months period, we assessed the viral causes for upper and lower respiratory infections in COPD (n=155) and control (n=103) subjects. We collected nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and peripheral blood under baseline and exacerbated condition. We determined the effect of human rhinovirus (HRV) proteinases on T cell activation in humans, and in mice. RESULTS: HRVs are isolated from nasal and lung fluid from subjects with AE-COPD. BAL fluid, and CD4 T cells from COPD patients exhibited a type 1 T helper (Th1), and Th2 cell cytokine phenotype during acute infection. HRV-encoded proteinase 2A activated monocyte-derived dendritic cells in vitro, and induced strong Th1, and Th2 immune responses from CD4 T cells. Intranasal administration of recombinant rhinovirus proteinase 2A in mice resulted in an increase in airway hyperreactivity, lung inflammation, and IL-4 and IFN-\u03B3 production from CD4 T cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patients with severe COPD show Th1 and Th2 bias responses during AE-COPD. HRV-encoded proteinase 2A, like other microbial proteinases, could provide a Th1 and Th2-biasing adjuvant factor during upper and lower respiratory infection in patients with severe COPD. Alteration of the immune response to secreted viral proteinases may contribute to worsening of dyspnea and respiratory failure in COPD.","publish_time":"2010-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Manisha; Lee, Seung-Hyo; Porter, Paul; Xu, Chuang; Ohno, Ayako; Atmar, Robert L.; Greenberg, Stephen B.; Bandi, Venkata; Gern, Jim; Amineva, Svetlana; Aminev, Alex; Skern, Tim; Smithwick, Pamela; Perusich, Sarah; Barrow, Nadia; Roberts, Luz; Corry, David B.; Kheradmand, Farrah","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f3c9c6d018c8fcc2ec626043d4a0e81142c49fc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/85968b0e042d51b98fc82fa831f15fd3a3012736.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2881843.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2010.02.035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674910004215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20430426/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674910004215; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2881843?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD patients","AE-COPD","severe COPD","COPD exacerbation","Acute exacerbation of COPD","CD4 T cells","lung fluid","respiratory failure","lower respiratory infections","lower respiratory viral infections","lung inflammation","T helper","Th2 immune responses","major causes of lung","T cell activation","advanced lung disease","HRV-encoded proteinase","strong Th1","viral causes","BAL fluid","Th2 bias responses","secreted viral proteinases","Tobacco related lung diseases","Th2 cell cytokine phenotype","acute infection","microbial proteinases","mice","subjects","activated monocyte-derived dendritic cells","Th2-biasing adjuvant factor","Intranasal administration of recombinant rhinovirus proteinase","host response","related disability","pathogen-derived factors","effect of human rhinovirus","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","peripheral blood","IFN-\u03B3 production","baseline","airway hyperreactivity","increase","humans","bronchoalveolar lavage","exacerbated condition","BACKGROUND","findings","dyspnea","months period","Alteration","control","HRVs","death","mechanism","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

CLEC5A also binds to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) disaccharides of bacterial cell walls. Compared to other C-type lectins (DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR) and TLRs, CLEC5A binds its ligands with relatively low affinities. However, CLEC5A forms a multivalent hetero-complex with DC-SIGN and other C-type lectins upon engagement with ligands, and thereby mediates microbe-induced inflammatory responses via activation of Syk. For example, in vivo studies in mouse models have demonstrated that CLEC5A is responsible for flaviviruses-induced hemorrhagic shock and neuroinflammation, and a CLEC5A polymorphism in humans is associated with disease severity following infection with dengue virus. In addition, CLEC5A is co-activated with TLR2 by Listeria and Staphylococcus. Furthermore, CLEC5A-postive myeloid cells are responsible for Concanavilin A-induced aseptic inflammatory reactions. Thus, CLEC5A is a promiscuous pattern recognition receptor in myeloid cells and is a potential therapeutic target for attenuation of both septic and aseptic inflammatory reactions.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sung, Pei-Shan; Chang, Wei-Chiao; Hsieh, Shie-Liang","journal":"Lectin in Host Defense Against Microbial Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3675958220e1e37a80f120f39f6480364c4b0c68.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121389.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-1580-4_3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152943/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CLEC5A polymorphism","CLEC5A-postive myeloid cells","C-type lectins","aseptic inflammatory reactions","dendritic cells","DC-SIGNR","ligands","inflammatory responses","activation of Syk","N-acetylglucosamine","N-acetylmuramic acid","MurNAc","Concanavilin","attenuation","promiscuous pattern recognition receptor","disease severity","terminal fucose","potential therapeutic target","GlcNAc","neuroinflammation","flaviviruses","mannose moieties of viral glycans","disaccharides of bacterial cell walls","multivalent hetero-complex","hemorrhagic shock","mouse models","spleen tyrosine kinase","infection","dengue virus","macrophages","neutrophils","virions","TLR2","microbe","humans","engagement","TLRs","Listeria","monocytes","example","studies","low affinities","Staphylococcus","addition"],"language":"en"},

The most remarkable characteristic of BEN is the focal topographical nature that characterizes its occurrence at the global, national, and even household level. BEN affects only certain endemic rural foci along tributaries of the Danube River in the Balkan countries of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Serbia. The spatial distribution has remained astonishingly unchanged with time because the disease affects the same endemic clusters as 50 years ago. The natural course of the disease is characterized by universal development of end-stage renal disease and the frequent development of upper urinary tract tumors, posing a substantial disease burden to the afflicted areas. The greatest challenge in the study of BEN has been the elucidation of its cause. The unique features of the disease, in particular its endemic nature and the long incubation period required for the disease to develop, have led to the proposal that BEN represents a unique environmental disease. The quest for the responsible environmental factor has been long and diverse, and although no definitive answer has been provided to date, converging lines of evidence support the theory that long-term consumption of food contaminated with aristolochic acid underlies the pathogenesis of BEN. The present review describes the evolution of our knowledge of BEN in relation to the development of the main theories for its pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bamias, Giorgos; Boletis, John","journal":"American Journal of Kidney Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5dd112f83f67d2df341d9cf1a1ce2035b9e2422.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115735.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18725017/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272638608009931; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272638608009931; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2008.05.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["BEN"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Danube River","Bulgaria","Croatia","Romania"],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of BEN","unique environmental disease","study of BEN","knowledge of BEN","stage renal disease","substantial disease burden","endemic nature","remarkable characteristic of BEN","chronic tubulointerstitial kidney disease","endemic clusters","unique features","Balkan endemic nephropathy","unique epidemiological features","certain endemic rural foci","universal development of end","frequent development of upper urinary tract tumors","focal topographical nature","Balkan countries of Bosnia","long incubation period","responsible environmental factor","Danube River","tributaries","aristolochic acid","long-term consumption of food","Croatia","theory","occurrence","Bulgaria","date","lines of evidence","Romania","evolution","afflicted areas","relation","main theories","definitive answer","quest","elucidation","greatest challenge","time","proposal","household level","spatial distribution","present review","Serbia","years","natural course","cause"],"language":"en"},

Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs (3,900) were either i.o.-vaccinated at 18 d of incubation or chicks from eggs that were not i.o.-vaccinated were s.c.-vaccinated at hatch. The i.o. injections (50 \u03BCL) were delivered by a commercial multi-egg injector and s.c. injections (200 \u03BCL) were delivered by an automatic pneumatic s.c. injector. The pht was imposed on chicks after vaccination. Sixteen birds were initially assigned to each of 15 replicate floor pens belonging to each of the moa and pht combination groups and were grown out through 48 doa. At 48 doa, 6 birds were randomly selected from each replicate pen and were weighed and fasted for 16 h before being processed. At 49 doa, whole carcass, fat pad, breast muscle, and tenders muscles weights were recorded. Whole carcass weight as a percentage of live BW, and fat pad, breast muscle, and tenders muscles weights as percentages of both live and whole carcass weights were calculated. Upon subjection of the data to a 2 \u00D7 2 factorial analysis, only a main effect due to moa was observed for tenders muscles weight as a percentage of live and whole carcass weights. Tenders muscles weight as a percentage of both live (P \u2264 0.010) and whole carcass (P \u2264 0.004) weight was higher in birds hatched from eggs that received i.o. rather than s.c. vaccinations. In conclusion, in comparison to s.c. vaccination, i.o. vaccination increased relative tenders weight yield, whether or not broilers were held for 4 or 18 h prior to placement. Therefore, with regard to broiler processing yield, i.o. and s.c. vaccinations were safe for the administration of the MD vaccine, with i.o. vaccination displaying a slight potential advantage.","publish_time":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peebles, E.D.; Barbosa, T.M.; Cummings, T.S.; Dickson, J.; Womack, S.K.; Gerard, P.D.","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172885.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pex201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29050405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ross"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["carcass weights","tenders muscles weights","doa","relative tenders weight yield","moa","eggs","birds","percentage of live BW","broiler processing yield","breast muscle","fat pad","processing yield of male broilers","MD vaccine","injections","h pre-placement","\u03BCL","chicks","vaccinations","pht combination groups","d of age","method of administration","d of incubation","replicate pen","replicate floor pens","commercial multi-egg injector","time","percentages","Marek\u0027s disease","main effect","factorial analysis","slight potential advantage","regard","comparison","ovo","data","conclusion","Ross","Effects","subjection","hatch"],"language":"en"},

The virus has caused great economic loss to the Chinese swine production during the past years. Herein, we experimentally infected SPF pigs using two strains of PRRSV with different pathogenicity and observed the lung pathological changes looking for new sights on the possible pathogenesis associated with the virulence of HP-PRRSV. The results indicated that the HP-PRRSV-infected pigs died and exhibited severe pathological changes of lungs featuring increased neutrophils, mast cells and mononuclear macrophages, compared with the pigs inoculated with low pathogenic (LP-) PRRSV. Furthermore, the pigs infected with HP-PRRSV showed the higher levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, interleukin (IL)-8 and histamine, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), platelet activation factor (PAF) in sera than those inoculated with LP-PRRSV.

Patients and Methods RNA was extracted from cardiac tissue flash frozen at therapeutic surgical septal myectomy for 106 patients with HCM and from 39 healthy donor hearts. Expression profiling of 37,846 genes was performed using the Illumina Human HT-12v3 Expression BeadChip. All HCM patients were genotyped for pathogenic variants causing HCM. Technical validation was performed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. This study was started on January 1, 1999 and final analysis was completed on April 20, 2020. Results Overall, 22% of the transcriptome (8443 genes) was expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Analysis by genotype revealed that gene expression changes were similar among genotypic subgroups of HCM, with only 4-6% of the transcriptome exhibiting differential expression between genotypic subgroups. qRT-PCR confirmed differential expression in 92% of tested transcripts. Notably, in the context of COVID-19, the transcript for ACE2, a negative regulator of the angiotensin system, was the single most up-regulated gene in HCM (fold-change 3.53, q-value=1.30x10-23), which was confirmed with qRT-PCR in triplicate (fold-change 3.78; p=5.22x10-4), and Western blot confirmed a \u003E5-fold over-expression of ACE2 protein (fold-change 5.34, p=1.66x10-6). Conclusions Over 20% of the transcriptome is expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Importantly, ACE2 was the most up-regulated gene in HCM indicating perhaps the heart\u2019s compensatory effort to mount an anti-hypertrophic, anti-fibrotic response. However, given that the SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 for viral entry, this 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein may confer increased risk for COVID-19 manifestations and outcomes in patients with increased ACE2 transcript expression and protein levels in the heart.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bos, J.

To investigate whether cyclophilin A (CypA) can up-regulate the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in monocytes/macrophages and whether CD147 facilitates this regulation in RA. Methods. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from RA patients and differentiated into macrophages by M-CSF (15 ng/ml). Under CypA stimulation (200 ng/ml), the protein release and activation of MMPs were detected by gelatin zymography and invasion assay. Human monocyte cell line THP-1 cells were selected for the advanced searching for potential interaction between CypA and CD147 in production of MMPs and cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM). Results. CypA significantly increased production and activation of MMP-9, not MMP-2, in the monocytes/macrophages derived from RA SF. CSA and HAb18G/CD147 antagonistic peptide AP-9 against CD147, respectively, dramatically decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, both in the absence or presence of CypA. Similar effects of CypA on MMP-9 production and cell invasion were observed in THP-1 cells. CypA-induced nuclear factor \u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) activity for MMP-9 transcription were strongly blocked by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors (U0126 and SP600125, respectively), but not by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors (SB203580). CypA also induced calcium mobilization and increased the adhesion of THP-1 cells to ECM. Conclusions. These findings suggest that in RA, the abundant CypA, by its direct binding to CD147, up-regulates MMP-9 expression and adhesion of monocytes/macrophages to ECM, and the cyclophilin-CD147 interactions might contribute to the destruction of cartilage and bone.","publish_time":"2008-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Y.; Lu, N.; Zhou, J.; Chen, Z.-n.; Zhu, P.","journal":"Rheumatology (Oxford)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/379fe37b445c504fb1a9d330fb3701332b26a550.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107241.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18567920/; https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/ken225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RA","RA SF","CSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of MMP","abundant CypA","presence of CypA","CypA stimulation","macrophages","Similar effects of CypA","adhesion of monocytes","cell adhesion","adhesion of THP","cyclophilin-CD147 interactions","ECM","cells","production of MMPs","cell invasion","increased production","CD147 antagonistic peptide AP","inhibitors","activation of MMPs","RA patients","Peripheral blood monocytes","Human monocyte cell line THP","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","amino terminal kinase","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","NF-\u03BAB","extracellular matrix","protein release","invasion assay","nuclear factor \u03BAB","JNK","ERK","MAPK","HAb18G","CSA","potential interaction","advanced searching","activity","gelatin zymography","U0126","transcription","direct binding","calcium mobilization","SP600125","destruction of cartilage","SB203580","absence","regulation","bone","Methods","CSF","findings","Results","Conclusions","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Using wireless sensor network technology, we obtained high-resolution data of CPIs during a typical day at an American high school, permitting the reconstruction of the social network relevant for infectious disease transmission. At a 94% coverage, we collected 762,868 CPIs at a maximal distance of 3 meters among 788 individuals. The data revealed a high density network with typical small world properties and a relatively homogenous distribution of both interaction time and interaction partners among subjects. Computer simulations of the spread of an influenza-like disease on the weighted contact graph are in good agreement with absentee data during the most recent influenza season. Analysis of targeted immunization strategies suggested that contact network data are required to design strategies that are significantly more effective than random immunization. Immunization strategies based on contact network data were most effective at high vaccination coverage.","publish_time":"2010-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salath\u0027e, Marcel; Kazandjieva, Maria; Lee, Jung Woo; Levis, Philip; Feldman, Marcus W.; Jones, James H.","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bbda9ef5b64322031b9d01a2af3a64f6509bfd8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.4622v2.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1009094108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21149721/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact network data","high-resolution data of CPIs","high density network","absentee data","social network relevant","wireless sensor network technology","infectious disease transmission","Analysis of targeted immunization strategies","high vaccination coverage","random immunization","dynamic patterns of CPIs","weighted contact graph","American high school","typical day","interaction time","interaction partners","transmission route","rapid pandemic spread","recent influenza season","frequent infectious diseases","typical small world properties","homogenous distribution","reconstruction","good agreement","droplets","highest potential","humans","close proximity interactions","subjects","maximal distance","meters","Computer simulations","individuals","importance"],"language":"en"},

It was identified in Hong Kong in 2012. Given that neither specific antiviral drugs nor vaccines are available for newly emerging porcine deltacoronavirus, searching for effective antiviral drugs is a high priority. In this study, lithium chloride (LiCl) and diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG), which are host-acting antivirals (HAAs), were tested against PDCoV. We found that LiCl and DG inhibited PDCoV replication in LLC-PK1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The antiviral effects of LiCl and DG occurred at the early stage of PDCoV replication, and DG also inhibited virus attachment to the cells. Moreover, both drugs inhibited PDCoV-induced apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells. This study suggests LiCl and DG as new drugs for the treatment of PDCoV infection.","publish_time":"2019-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhai, Xiaofeng; Wang, Shilei; Zhu, Mengyan; He, Wei; Pan, Zhongzhou; Su, Shuo","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da841082920197ef43a5d5bdb05b38ed7cccf9fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6789623.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505777/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens8030144","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DG"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["inhibited PDCoV replication","effective antiviral drugs","PDCoV-induced apoptosis","specific antiviral drugs","treatment of PDCoV infection","antiviral effects of LiCl","new drugs","early stage of PDCoV replication","LLC-PK1 cells","emerging porcine deltacoronavirus","study","emerging global swine virus","virus attachment","vaccines","propensity","lithium chloride","HAAs","dose-dependent manner","high priority","diammonium glycyrrhizinate","host-acting antivirals","interspecies transmission","Hong Kong"],"language":"en"},

We wished to examine the relationship between the intensity of media coverage for selected health topics and their actual risk to public health. METHODS: Mass media reports in the United States on emerging and chronic health hazards (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bioterrorism, West Nile Fever, AIDS, smoking and physical inactivity) were counted for the year 2003, using LexisNexis database. The number of media reports for each health risk was correlated with the corresponding death rate as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: The number of media reports inversely correlated with the actual number of deaths for the health risks evaluated. SARS and bioterrorism killed less than a dozen people in 2003, but together generated over 100 000 media reports, far more than those covering smoking and physical inactivity, which killed nearly a million Americans. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging health hazards are over-reported in mass media by comparison to common threats to public health. Since premature mortality in industrialized societies is most often due to well-known risks such as smoking and physical inactivity, their under-representation on public agendas may cause suboptimal prioritization of public health resources.","publish_time":"2008-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bomlitz, Larisa J.; Brezis, Mayer","journal":"J Public Health (Oxf)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e940d616bf3c36cc5c8065358bb7a52eafa5fd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107549.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18281322/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdn009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["West Nile Fever","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","SARS"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["health risks","Mass media reports","number of media reports","Emerging health hazards","chronic health hazards","selected health topics","suboptimal prioritization of public health resources","leading source of health information","public agendas","general public","intensity of media coverage","physical inactivity","smoking","actual risk","bioterrorism","actual number of deaths","SARS","well-known risks","severe acute respiratory syndrome","United States","AIDS","comparison","West Nile Fever","common threats","under-representation","Centers","CONCLUSIONS","corresponding death rate","industrialized societies","premature mortality","Disease Control","Prevention","year","relationship","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS","LexisNexis database","dozen people","Americans"],"language":"en"},

A number of neurotropic viruses have been found to invade the brain through the OB. There is growing evidence that microscopic particles of toxic dusts can propagate from the nasal epithelium to the OB and further into the brain. These harmful agents impair cellular elements of the brain. Apparently, cells in the OB are the most affected, as they are the first to encounter viral infections and toxic particles. It is well known that neuronal and glial progenitors are continuously generated from neuronal stem cells in the subventricular zone of the adult brain and then migrate predominantly into the OB. Therefore, it is feasible to suggest that substitution of injured or dead cells in the OB by new-born neurons, differentiating from progenitors, plays a role in protecting the OB neuronal microcircuits from destruction. Furthermore, some cytokines and chemokines released in response to infection and/or intoxication can modulate different stages of neurogenesis (proliferation, migration, and differentiation). We hypothesize that continuous neurogenesis in the olfactory system throughout adulthood evolved as a protective mechanism to prevent impairment of the most ancient but vitally important sensory system. In addition, differentiation of a substantial portion of progenitors to glial cells, including macrophages and microglia, may create an additional barrier to exogenous agents on their way deep to the brain.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loseva, Elena; Yuan, Ti-Fei; Karnup, Sergei","journal":"Brain Research Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74a7bb180d2acef4bcc90a8d389526942c320482.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112504.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165017308001367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19027790/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017308001367; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.10.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["brain structures","adult brain","glial cells","OB neuronal microcircuits","neuronal stem cells","dead cells","glial progenitors","sensory neurons","nasal epithelium","penetration of exogenous agents","olfactory system","toxic particles","harmful agents","differentiation","substantial portion of progenitors","important sensory system","new-born neurons","olfactory bulb","microscopic particles of toxic dusts","continuous neurogenesis","different stages of neurogenesis","subventricular zone","intoxication","proliferation","microglia","adulthood","direct inputs","highest vulnerability","additional barrier","substitution of injured","response","migration","evidence","cellular elements","parts","macrophages","way","role","protective mechanism","outpost position","chemokines","impairment","viral infections","destruction","number of neurotropic viruses","cytokines"],"language":"en"},

Degradation of iNOS was reduced by a calpain inhibitor, suggesting that PIN1 may affect induction of other calpain-sensitive inflammatory proteins, such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, in MAEC. METHODS: MAEC, transduced with lentivirus encoding an inactive control short hairpin (sh) RNA or one targeting PIN1 that reduced PIN1 by 85%, were used. Cells were treated with LPS/IFN, calpain inhibitors (carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal (zVF), PD150606), cycloheximide and COX inhibitors to determine the effect of PIN1 depletion on COX-2 and calpain. RESULTS: LPS or IFN alone did not induce COX-2. However, treatment with 10 \u03BCg LPS plus 20 ng IFN per ml induced COX-2 protein 10-fold in Control shRNA MAEC. Induction was significantly greater (47-fold) in PIN1 shRNA cells. COX-2-dependent prostaglandin E2 production increased 3-fold in KD MAEC, but did not increase in Control cells. The additional increase in COX-2 protein due to PIN1 depletion was post-transcriptional, as induction of COX-2 mRNA by LPS/IFN was the same in cells containing or lacking PIN1. Instead, the loss of COX-2 protein, after treatment with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis, was reduced in cells lacking PIN1 in comparison with Control cells, indicating that degradation of the enzyme was reduced. zVF and PD150606 each enhanced the induction of COX-2 by LPS/IFN. zVF also slowed the loss of COX-2 after treatment with cycloheximide, and COX-2 was degraded by exogenous \u03BC-calpain in vitro. In contrast to iNOS, physical interaction between COX-2 and PIN1 was not detected, suggesting that effects of PIN1 on calpain, rather than COX-2 itself, affect COX-2 degradation. While cathepsin activity was unaltered, depletion of PIN1 reduced calpain activity by 55% in comparison with Control shRNA cells. CONCLUSION: PIN1 reduced calpain activity and slowed the degradation of COX-2 in MAEC, an effect recapitulated by an inhibitor of calpain. Given the sensitivity of COX-2 and iNOS to calpain, PIN1 may normally limit induction of these and other calpain substrates by maintaining calpain activity in endothelial cells.","publish_time":"2009-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Tongzheng; Schneider, Ryan A; Shah, Vaibhav; Huang, Yongcheng; Likhotvorik, Rostislav I; Keshvara, Lakhu; Hoyt, Dale G","journal":"J Inflamm (Lond)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0ce640c27c2c8ef5f83e71bec07d829327d69d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2708161.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-9255-6-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19545424/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["IFN","LPS/IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induction of COX","degradation of COX","COX inhibitors","loss of COX","induced COX","sensitivity of COX","PIN1 shRNA cells","depletion of PIN1","calpain activity","lacking PIN1","targeting PIN1","effects of PIN1","calpain inhibitors","inhibitor of calpain","Control cells","calpain substrates","effect of PIN1 depletion","Control shRNA cells","exogenous \u03BC-calpain","Control shRNA MAEC","Degradation of iNOS","calpain-sensitive inflammatory proteins","ng IFN","\u03BCg LPS","KD MAEC","murine aortic endothelial cells","protein synthesis","fold","treatment","cycloheximide","zVF","cathepsin activity","inactive control short hairpin","comparison","PD150606","additional increase","lentivirus","turnover of inducible nitric oxide synthase","carbobenzoxy-valinyl","peptidyl-proline isomerase","phenylalaninal","Mitosis Gene","dependent prostaglandin E2 production","physical interaction","cyclooxygenase","coli endotoxin","interferon-\u03B3","Interacting","mRNA","BACKGROUND","contrast","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

The heterogeneity of mosquito bites of humans during the spread of dengue virus is an important factor that should be considered when modeling the dynamics. However, traditional models generally assumed homogeneous mixing between humans and vectors, which is inconsistent with reality. In this study, we proposed a compartmental model with negative binomial distribution transmission terms to model this heterogeneity at the population level. By including the aquatic stage of mosquitoes and incorporating the impacts of the environment and climate factors, an extended model was used to simulate the 2014 dengue outbreak in Guangzhou, China, and to simulate the spread of dengue in different scenarios. The results showed that a high level of heterogeneity can result in a small peak size in an outbreak. As the level of heterogeneity decreases, the transmission dynamics approximate the dynamics predicted by the corresponding homogeneous mixing model. The simulation results from different scenarios showed that performing interventions early and decreasing the carrying capacity for mosquitoes are necessary for preventing and controlling dengue epidemics.

Both worries and concerns about COVID-19 and psychological maladjustment may be related to cultural factors. Individualism, collectivism, equality, and hierarchy seem to be meaningful perspectives to take into account. A total of 1183 Italian emerging adults were asked to fill out an online survey during the second week of the national lockdown in Italy. Results showed they reported an accurate perceived knowledge about COVID-19. At the same time, they showed higher worries and concerns about COVID-19 for their relatives, followed by more general/social worries. The lowest score included worries about COVID-19 related to themselves. State anxiety and stress levels were above the normal cutoff, confirming the challenges that emerging adults are facing during the pandemic. On one hand, emerging adults\u0027 collectivistic orientation was related to higher perceived risks of infection; on the other hand, it predicted lower psychological maladjustment, controlling for socio-demographic variables. The study suggests that to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and decrease levels of psychological maladjustment in emerging adulthood, individuals\u0027 cultural orientation such as the wish of sharing common goals with others, interdependence, and sociability, have to be emphasized and promoted as protective factors.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Germani, Alessandro; Buratta, Livia; Delvecchio, Elisa; Mazzeschi, Claudia","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429536/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["State"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["time of COVID","experience COVID","emerging adulthood","higher worries","Italian emerging adults","higher concerns","levels of psychological maladjustment","emerging adults\u0027 collectivistic orientation","lower psychological maladjustment","higher risk","psychological adjustment","social worries","higher perceived risks of infection","hand","cultural factors","pandemic","individuals\u0027 cultural orientation","stress levels","common feelings","common goals","protective factors","accurate perceived knowledge","youth","role","reduced autonomy","self-directedness","week","future","possible asymptomatic carrier","wish","infections","medical reports","hierarchy","instability","normal cutoff","socio-demographic variables","collectivism","equality","meaningful perspectives","national lockdown","Italy","insecurity","spite","interdependence","State anxiety","challenges","coronavirus disease","aspects","total","lowest score","Individualism","account","online survey","Uncertainty","outbreak","Results","relatives","habits","routines","sociability","study"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251\u201315/2014 isolate clustered together with viruses of the GI-19 lineage. Recombination analysis gave evidence for distinct patterns of origin of RNA in the Sudanese isolate in multiple genes. Several sites of recombination were scattered throughout the genome suggesting that the Sudan-QX-like strain emerged as a unique recombinant from multiple recombination events of parental viruses from 4/91, H120 and ITA/90254/2005 genotypes.

Although these separate substantive areas agree that epidemiology refers to the distribution of disease in a population and the determinants of that distribution, the literature presents conflicting definitions of what makes a study a molecular epidemiologic study. In cancer and environmental epidemiology, molecular is defined almost exclusively in terms of biomarkers. However, biomarkers are only one type of molecular measure, and this definition ignores the many applications of molecular methods in genetic and infectious disease epidemiology. Early epidemiologists made tremendous strides with what are now relatively simple molecular tools, such as using microscopy for identification, showing agents not visible by microscope cause disease, and detecting protective antibodies with hemagglutination assays. In the microbiology literature, molecular epidemiology has become synonymous with the use of molecular fingerprints\u2014regardless of whether the study was population based or met other criteria consistent with an epidemiologic study.

For treatment of solutions containing 20 mg/L of Triton, the optimum obtained conditions are: 5.0 mg/L of nano TiO(2), 270.3 mg/L of KPS, and 34.0 mg/L of H(2)O(2) (1 mM of the oxidants), initial natural pH of 5.4 and temperature of 45 \u00B0C.

We have investigated the kinds of slippery sequence that can function at the IBV frameshift site by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of slippery-sequence mutants. We firstly confirmed that the site of frameshifting in IBV was at the heptanucleotide stretch UUUAAAC, and then used our knowledge of the pseudoknot structure and a suitable reporter gene to prepare an expression construct that allowed both the magnitude and direction of ribosomal frameshifting to be determined for candidate slippery sequences. Our results show that in almost all of the sequences tested, frameshifting is strictly into the \u22121 reading frame. Monotonous runs of nucleotides, however, gave detectable levels of a \u22122 \u002B1 frameshift product, and U stretches in particular gave significant levels (2% to 21%). Preliminary evidence suggests that the RNA pseudoknot may play a role in influencing frameshift direction. The spectrum of slip-sequences tested in this analysis included all those known or suspected to be utilized in vivo. Our results indicate that triplets of A, C, G and U are functional when decoded in the ribosomal P-site following slippage ( XXX YYYN) although C triplets were the least effective. In the A-site (XXY YYY N), triplets of C and G were non-functional. The identity of the nucleotide at position 7 of the slippery sequence (XXXYYY N ) was found to be a critical determinant of frameshift efficiency and we show that a hierarchy of frameshifting exists for A-site codons. These observations lead us to suggest that ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site is determined, at least in part, by the strength of the interaction of normal cellular tRNAs with the A-site codon and does not necessarily involve specialized \u201Cshifty\u201D tRNAs.","publish_time":"1992-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brierley, Ian; Jenner, Alison J.; Inglis, Stephen C.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdbfc53f7815dfd0af23044962ffff1f3ad4f296.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002228369290901U; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/002228369290901U","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","XXX YYYN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["site of frameshifting","IBV frameshift site","slippery-sequence","particular site","direction of ribosomal frameshifting","ribosomal P-site","site codons","frameshifting properties","hierarchy of frameshifting","frameshift direction","kinds of slippery sequence","ribosomal frameshift signal","C triplets","triplets of C","series of slippery","candidate slippery sequences","frameshift product","sequence mutants","downstream RNA pseudoknot","genomic RNA","pseudoknot structure","coronavirus IBV","critical determinant of frameshift efficiency","heptanucleotide","results","XXXYYY N","significant levels","detectable levels","XXY YYY N","interaction of normal cellular tRNAs","suitable reporter gene","magnitude","slippage","expression construct","position","elements","YYYN","role","strength","knowledge","UUUAAAC","Preliminary evidence","Monotonous runs of nucleotides","spectrum of slip","identity","analysis","observations"],"language":"en"},

They were tested for the presence of D. immitis antigen using SNAP Heartworm RT test kit. In this population, the average prevalence was 4.5%.

The prevalence was significantly higher in feral cats compared with domestic cats (8.4% vs 1.4%, P\u003C0.01). There was no significant difference between males and females (4.7% vs 4.2%, P\u003E0.05), but older cats (\u22653 years old) showed a statistically higher prevalence compared with younger cats (\u003C3 years old) in feral populations (16.8 vs 2.4%, P\u003C0.01), while the difference between the age groups was not statistically significant in domestic cats (2.4% vs 0.51%, P\u003E0.05), all these results suggest that outdoor exposure time may be one of the most important factors for D. immitis prevalence in cats.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to \u03B2-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.

To date, vaccines developed against HEV still need to be improved and a structural gene (ORF2), which encodes a capsid protein with high sequence conservation found across HEV genotypes, is a potential candidate. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against HEV infection, four small interference RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting ORF2 gene were constructed. A challenge against HEV infection by RNAi was performed in A549 cells. Real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time qPCR) and Western blot assay demonstrated that four HEV specific siRNAs (si-ORF2-1, si-ORF2-2, si-ORF2-3 and si-ORF2-4) were capable of protecting cells against HEV infection with very high specificity and efficiency. The results suggest that RNAi is a potent anti-HEV infection prophylaxis strategy.","publish_time":"2010-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Fen; Zhou, Junfang; Yang, Zhibiao; Cui, Li; Zhang, Wen; Yuan, Congli; Yang, Shixing; Zhu, Jianguo; Hua, Xiuguo","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba63294c4ff5f5a55e21e564d7af96c7ec6ed9a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117326.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509005434; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.10.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19963327/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509005434","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["si-ORF2","HEV genotypes","ORF2 gene","HEV specific siRNAs","RNAi","potent anti-HEV infection prophylaxis strategy","RNA interference","small interference RNA","Real-Time qPCR","high specificity","A549 cells","structural gene","high sequence conservation","Real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction","Western blot assay","duplex","species","capsid protein","Abstract Hepatitis E virus","rodents","human beings","pigs","zoonotic pathogen","potential candidate","efficiency","possibility","challenge","results","vaccines"],"language":"en"},

Methods Respiratory samples from patients with acute influenza-like symptoms were collected from May 2009 to December 2009. Respiratory viruses were detected by conventional culture methods and genome amplification techniques. Results Although IAn/H1N1 was the virus most frequently detected, several other respiratory viruses co-circulated with IAn/H1N1 during the pandemic period, especially rhinovirus. The similarity between clinical signs included in the clinical case definition for influenza and those caused by other respiratory viruses, particularly rhinovirus, suggest that a high percentage of viral infections were clinically diagnosed as case of influenza.

We find that persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of M. schreibersii, on cross-species mixing with M. myotis, and on survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity. The virus would not persist in the single colony of M. myotis. Our study provides for the first time epidemiological estimates for EBLV-1 progression in M. schreibersii.

However, the impact of public transportation system on local spread of dengue in urban settings remains poorly understood, due to the difficulty in collecting relevant locality, transportation and disease incidence data with sufficient detail, and in suitably quantifying the combined effect of proximity and passenger flow. We quantify proximity and passenger traffic data relating to 2014\u20132015 dengue outbreaks in Kaohsiung, Taiwan by introducing a \u201CRisk Associated with Metro Passengers Presence\u201D (RAMPP), which considers the passenger traffic of stations located within a fixed radius, giving more weight to the busier and/or closer stations. In order to analyze the contagion risk associated with nearby presence of one or more Kaohsiung Rapid Transit (KRT) stations, we cluster the Li\u0027s (the fourth level administrative subdivision in Taiwan) of Kaohsiung based on their RAMPP value using the K-means algorithm. We then perform analysis of variance on distinct clusterings and detect significant differences for both years. The subsequent post hoc tests (Dunn) show that yearly incidence rate observed in the areas with highest RAMPP values is always significantly greater than that recorded with smaller RAMPP values. RAMPP takes into account of population mobility in urban settings via the use of passenger traffic information of urban transportation system, that captures the simple but important idea that large amount of passenger flow in and out of a station can dramatically increase the contagion risk of dengue in the neighborhood. Our study provides a new perspective in identifying high-risk areas for transmissions and thus enhances our understanding of how public rapid transit system contributes to disease spread in densely populated urban areas, which could be useful in the design of more effective and timely intervention and control measures for future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanna, Mattia; Hsieh, Ying-Hen","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92517f0969a63021ac48bfcd02975b1e1aa96fef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112089.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969717308859; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.050; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717308859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28499330/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Li"],"organizations":["Associated","RAMPP"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["passenger traffic of stations","passenger flow","passenger traffic data","urban settings","contagion risk of dengue","dengue outbreaks","use of passenger traffic information of urban transportation system","local spread of dengue","populated urban areas","global spread of dengue","highest RAMPP values","smaller RAMPP values","Kaohsiung Rapid Transit","impact of public transportation system","public rapid transit system","disease incidence data","high-risk areas","Taiwan","closer stations","important factor","important idea","nearby presence","future outbreaks","yearly incidence rate","Metro Passengers Presence","combined effect of proximity","timely intervention","Dunn","control measures","recent decades","relevant locality","account of population mobility","distinct clusterings","understanding","level administrative subdivision","significant differences","new perspective","tests","design","Li\u0027s","transmissions","KRT","analysis of variance","fixed radius","weight","subsequent post","tropical regions","Abstract Urbanization","difficulty","neighborhood","years","study","order","algorithm"],"language":"en"},

The incidence of persistent CMO (pCMO; defined as CMO present after 3 months) following uncomplicated surgery is uncertain. We wished to identify the incidence, management and visual outcomes of such patients. METHODS: A Scottish Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (SOSU) questionnaire was sent monthly to every ophthalmic specialist in Scotland over an 18-month period from 1st January 2018 asking them to report all new patients with pCMO confirmed on OCT scanning following uncomplicated cataract surgery. A follow-up questionnaire was sent 9 months after initial presentation. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of pCMO were reported, giving an incidence of 2.2 cases of pCMO per 10,000 uncomplicated cataract surgeries. Mean age was 74.9 years (SD 10.2; range 44\u201386) with a male preponderance (72.7%). Two patients developed pCMO in each eye. Six cases (46.2%) had hypertension and one had diabetes. Three eyes required intracameral adjuncts (two iris hooks, one intracameral phenylephrine). Postoperative visual acuity (VA) at 3 months was logMAR 0.48 (0.2\u20130.8). Average mean central retinal thickness (CRT) at 3 months was 497microns (270\u2013788). The most common initial treatment comprised topical steroids and topical NSAIDs (61.5%). Other management strategies included systemic steroids, intravitreal steroids and oral acetazolamide. At 1-year post-op, mean VA was logMAR 0.18 (0.1\u20130.3) with average mean CRT of 327microns (245\u2013488). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a low incidence of pCMO following uncomplicated cataract surgery in Scotland (0.02%), with inconsistent and variable management regimes. A nationally agreed treatment protocol is required.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Erikitola, Ore-Oluwa; Siempis, Thomas; Foot, Barny; Lockington, David","journal":"Eye (Lond)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7af1cbf0b47884a5092a54df53cd96d9653da80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202460.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-0908-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VA"],"locations":["Scotland"],"keyphrases":["cases of pCMO","uncomplicated cataract surgery","uncomplicated surgery","months","low incidence of pCMO","mean VA","uncomplicated cataract surgeries","routine cataract surgery","average mean CRT","incidence of persistent CMO","topical steroids","Mean age","intravitreal steroids","systemic steroids","CMO present","management strategies","Scotland","logMAR","new patients","microns","Average mean central retinal thickness","common initial treatment","variable management regimes","topical NSAIDs","intracameral phenylephrine","eyes required intracameral adjuncts","visual outcomes","follow-up questionnaire","initial presentation","year post-op","Postoperative visual acuity","agreed treatment protocol","Post-operative cystoid macular oedema","iris hooks","Scottish Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit","deterioration of vision","SOSU","PURPOSE","scanning","oral acetazolamide","METHODS","years","SD","ophthalmic specialist","range","month period","hypertension","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","male preponderance","diabetes"],"language":"en"},

However, the current assay based on the cytopathic effect (CPE) which has been frequently cited in literature has several limitations. The CPE assay relies on the visual observation on the damage of SCV infected target cells under a microscope. It is subjected to observer variations and it is difficult to generate a quantitative determination of neutralizing activities based on the level of CPE. In the current study, we established the utility of two additional assays to measure the neutralizing activities against SCV: the plaque reduction (PR) and the neutral red staining (NRS) assays. The PR assay described in this study was modified from the traditional viral plaque reduction assay by using an improved crystal staining method to achieve better plague formation in SCV infected Vero E6 cells. The NRS neutralization assay was adopted from a similar system used for detecting neutralizing antibody responses against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In this assay, the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies was determined by the cell viability which is measured by the uptake of neutral red dye at A540. The neutralizing antibody titers can be easily determined with either of the two new assays. In this report, we described the utility of these two new neutralization assays in measuring the neutralizing activities against SCV infection from rabbit sera immunized with various forms of spike protein of SCV.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shixia; Sakhatskyy, Pavlo; Chou, Te-Hui W.; Lu, Shan","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3023cba0cdae804e98d7b0b9f92841f6a73ce474.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094753.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175905000839; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175905000839","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","CPE","SCV","NRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CPE assay","PR assay","current assay","neutralizing antibody responses","neutralizing antibody titers","SCV infection","NRS neutralization assay","quantitative determination of neutralizing activities","new assays","Abstract Accurate assessment of neutralizing antibody activities","protective effect of neutralizing antibodies","new neutralization assays","SCV infected Vero E6 cells","damage of SCV infected target cells","additional assays","traditional viral plaque reduction assay","various forms of spike protein of SCV","neutral red staining","SARS","utility","current study","level of CPE","uptake of neutral red dye","cytopathic effect","improved crystal staining method","better plague formation","patients","rabbit sera","human immunodeficiency virus type","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","visual observation","similar system","experimental vaccines","HIV","volunteers","animals","A540","coronavirus","microscope","cell viability","observer variations","literature","limitations","report"],"language":"en"},

The structure reveals that the 5\u2032-end guanosine of the downstream RNA template interacts with a fingers domain pocket, with the base sandwiched by H44 and R277 side chains through hydrophobic stacking interactions, and these interactions are still maintained after one in-crystal translocation event induced by nucleotide incorporation, implying that the pocket could regulate the functional properties of the polymerase by interacting with RNA. When mutated, residue R277 showed an impact on virus proliferation in virological studies with residue H44 having a synergistic effect. In vitro biochemical data further suggest that mutations at these two sites affect RNA binding, EC stability, but not polymerase catalytic rate (k(cat)) and apparent NTP affinity (K(M,NTP)).

Despite many studies predicting the likelihood of bacteremia in CAP patients, those results have been rarely implemented in clinical practice, and use of blood culture in CAP is still increasing. This study evaluated impact of implementing a previously derived and validated bacteremia prediction rule. METHODS: In this registry-based before and after study, we used piecewise regression analysis to compare the blood culture rate before and after implementation of the prediction rule. We also compared 30-day mortality, emergency department (ED) length of stay, time-interval to initial antibiotics after ED arrival, and any changes to the antibiotics regimen as results of the blood cultures. In subgroup analysis, we compared two groups (with or without the use of the prediction rule) after implementation period, using propensity score matching. RESULTS: Following the implementation, the blood culture rate declined from 85.5% to 78.1% (P = 0.003) without significant changes in 30-day mortality and antibiotics regimen. The interval to initial antibiotics (231 min vs. 221 min, P = 0.362) and length of stay (1019 min vs. 954 min, P = 0.354) were not significantly changed. In subgroup analysis, the group that use the prediction rule showed 25 min faster antibiotics initiation (P = 0.002) and 48 min shorter length of stay (P = 0.007) than the group that did not use the rule.

Imposing emergency lockdown to stop infection of COVID 19 virus on 24.03.2020 in India has created economic crisis but it has facilitated environment to restore its quality. Global scale study has already proved the qualitative improvement of air quality but its possible impact at regional level is not investigated yet. Middle catchment of Dwarka river basin of Eastern India is well known for stone quarrying and crushing and therefore the region is highly polluted. The present study has attempted to explore the impact of forced lockdown on environmental components like Particulate matter (PM) 10, Land surface temperature (LST), river water quality, noise using image and field derived data in pre and during lockdown periods. Result clearly exhibits that Maximum PM10 concentration was 189 to 278 \u03BCg/m3 in pre lockdown period and it now ranges from 50 to 60 \u03BCg/m3 after 18 days of the commencement of lockdown in selected four stone crushing clusters. LST is reduced by 3\u20135 \u00B0C, noise level is dropped to \u003C65dBA which was above 85dBA in stone crusher dominated areas in pre lockdown period.

For instance, total dissolve solid (TDS) level in river water adjacent to crushing unit is attenuated by almost two times.

METHODS: Cohort of 370 hospitalized children (1 to 72 months) with SARI from May 2008 to March 2010 was enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens were tested by a commercial assay for 18 respiratory viral targets. The viral distribution and its association with clinical character were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Viral pathogen was detected in 350 (94.29%) of children with SARI. Overall, the most popular viruses were: enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV) (54.05%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (51.08%), human bocavirus (BoCA) (33.78%), human parainfluenzaviruse type 3 (PIV3) (15.41%), and adenovirus (ADV) (12.97%). Pandemic H1N1 was the dominant influenza virus (IFV) but was only detected in 20 (5.41%) of children. Moreover, detection rate of RSV and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) among suburb participants were significantly higher than that of urban area (P\u003C0.05). Incidence of VSARI among suburb participants was also significant higher, especially among those of 24 to 59 months group (P\u003C0.05). CONCLUSION: Piconaviruses (EV/RV) and paramyxoviruses are the most popular viral pathogens among children with SARI in this study. RSV and hMPV significantly increase the risk of SARI, especially in children younger than 24 months. Higher incidence of VSARI and more susceptibilities to RSV and hMPV infections were found in suburban patients.","publish_time":"2013-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Chen; Zhu, Na; Xie, Zhengde; Lu, Roujian; He, Bin; Liu, Chunyan; Ma, Xuejun; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89f70b62cc7e6aa71fbebcc3194b4ea5ad756c99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3750056.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23991128/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nasopharyngeal","Piconaviruses"],"organizations":["SARI","RSV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["hospitalized children","children younger","viral etiology","respiratory viral targets","viral distribution","risk of SARI","popular viral pathogens","H1N1 pandemic","Pandemic H1N1","Higher incidence of VSARI","suburb participants","human metapneumovirus","hMPV infections","respiratory syncytial virus","detection rate of RSV","RV","human bocavirus","months group","study","post-pandemic period","human parainfluenzaviruse type","clinical characterization","severe acute respiratory infection","popular viruses","dominant influenza virus","China","susceptibilities","specimens","enterovirus","rhinovirus","commercial assay","paramyxoviruses","comprehensive analysis","association","Nasopharyngeal aspirate","NPA","BACKGROUND","IFV","PIV3","suburban patients","CONCLUSION","Piconaviruses","METHODS","Cohort","urban area","RESULTS","adenovirus","ADV"],"language":"en"},

The latter issue is partially solved using correction methods in post-analysis of AVA but the accuracy of these methods is not yet accessed. This study employs two twisted wind profiles to test an urban area in a boundary layer wind tunnel to investigate the influence of twisted wind flows on the outcomes of AVA and to estimate the accuracy of three common correction methods: No-Shift, Threshold, and Proportional methods. The results reveal significant differences in wind speeds at the pedestrian level for twisted and conventional wind flows at locations with low building densities. The discrepancies in wind speeds are minimum at the locations where the density of buildings is high. The indicators calculated by the No-Shift method frequently deviate from those of the twisted wind flows, while the Threshold and Proportional methods routinely over-predict the indicators of AVA.","publish_time":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weerasuriya, A.

Epidemiologic studies in Asian children suggest that the etiologic agent(s) of KD may be associated with environmental changes. Laboratory findings are useful for the diagnosis of incomplete KD, and they can guide the next-step in treatment of initial intravenous immunoglobulin non-responders. CALs seem to develop in the early stages of the disease before a peak in inflammation. Therefore early treatment, before the peak in inflammation, is mandatory to reduce the risk of CAL progression and severity of CALs. The immunopathogenesis of KD is more likely that of acute rheumatic fever than scarlet fever. A hypothetical pathogenesis of KD is proposed under the premise of a \u0022protein homeostasis system\u0022; where innate and adaptive immune cells control pathogenic proteins that are toxic to host cells at a molecular level. After an infection of unknown KD pathogen(s), the pathogenic proteins produced from an unknown focus, spread and bind to endothelial cells of coronary arteries as main target cells. To control the action of pathogenic proteins and/or substances from the injured cells, immune cells are activated. Initially, non-specific T cells and non-specific antibodies are involved in this reaction, while hyperactivated immune cells produce various cytokines, leading to a cytokine imbalance associated with further endothelial cell injury. After the emergence of specific T cells and specific antibodies against the pathogenic proteins, tissue injury ceases and a repair reaction begins with the immune cells.","publish_time":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Kyung-Yil; Rhim, Jung-Woo; Kang, Jin-Han","journal":"Yonsei Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93df1925c1aa0cf7e721ebcbaed2d261c032d925.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3282974.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2012.53.2.262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22318812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD","CAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["injured cells","adaptive immune cells","non-specific T cells","main target cells","endothelial cells of coronary arteries","emergence of specific T cells","immunopathogenesis of KD","action of pathogenic proteins","diagnosis of incomplete KD","hypothetical pathogenesis of KD","infection of unknown KD pathogen","non-specific antibodies","early treatment","peak","severity of CALs","Kawasaki disease","inflammation","endothelial cell injury","repair reaction","scarlet fever","unknown focus","early stages","coronary artery lesions","tissue injury ceases","acute rheumatic fever","treatment of initial intravenous immunoglobulin non-responders","self-limited systemic inflammatory illness","Asian children","cytokine imbalance","etiologic agent","substances","protein homeostasis system","risk of CAL progression","various cytokines","step","premise","major complication","Epidemiologic studies","Laboratory findings","prognosis","molecular level","environmental changes"],"language":"en"},

Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barazzoni, Rocco; Bischoff, Stephan C.; Breda, Joao; Wickramasinghe, Kremlin; Krznaric, Zeljko; Nitzan, Dorit; Pirlich, Matthias; Singer, Pierre","journal":"Clin Nutr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36285edabf9f6a46f56d61f582c6a575e0a1d671.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138149.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561420301400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305181/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.03.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261561420301400","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients stabilization","cause malnutrition","nutritional management of COVID","longer ICU stay","higher mortality","higher morbidity","treatment of malnutrition","prolonged ICU stays","major cause of morbidity","additional morbidity","older adults","presence of older age","polymorbidity","practical guidance","high risk","acute disease","concise guidance","practical recommendations","relevant risk factor","Acute respiratory complications","intensive care unit","polymorbid individuals","European Society","threats","severe loss of skeletal muscle mass","Clinical Nutrition","malnourished people","Metabolism","function","ESPEN","poor quality of life","pandemics","unprecedented challenges","immunocompromised subjects","disability","negative impact","worst outcomes","current document","patient survival","healthcare systems","Prevention","diagnosis","Summary"],"language":"en"},

These findings bear potentially significant implications for public health, canine health and baboon conservation efforts, necessitating follow-up investigations and preventive measures at locations where baboons frequent human habitations, or are regarded as tourist attractions, in KSA.","publish_time":"2017-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"OLARINMOYE, A.O.; OLUGASA, B.O.; NIPHUIS, H.; HERWIJNEN, R.V.; VERSCHOOR, E.; BOUG, A.; ISHOLA, O.O.; BUITENDIJK, H.; FAGROUCH, Z.; AL-HEZAIMI, K.","journal":"Epidemiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d15859576ffb2ddefcd69392ae3358e0e31b4fbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113016.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28478775/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268817000905","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["baboons of KSA","sampled baboons","detectable MERSCoV antibodies","hamadryas baboon","serum antibodies","baboons frequent human habitations","human coronaviruses","Papio hamadryas hamadryas","canine health","large group of commensal baboons","canine coronaviruses","pathogenic coronavirus infections","public health","viral infections","indigenous species of non-human primates","baboon conservation efforts","Serum Neutralization Test","novel Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","locations","follow-up investigations","preventive measures","ELISA","technique","likely sources","direct Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay","significant implications","NHP","feral dogs","peer-reviewed publications","animals","outskirts of Ta\u0027if city","SNT","adults","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","camels","findings","evidence","CCoVs","humans","tourist attractions","NL63","HCoVs","juveniles"],"language":"en"},

PEDV is associated with the most severe pathogenesis in one-week-old piglets, with mortality rates reaching 100%. A PEDV strain was isolated from the intestinal tract of diarrheic piglets from a pig farm in Jiangsu Province in March 2016, termed the JS201603 isolate. The isolated virus was confirmed to be PEDV via RT-PCR, electron microscopy, a cytopathic effect assay and sequence analysis. The S and ORF3 genes of the JS201603 isolate were sequenced, revealing that the S gene was associated with a 15-base insertion at 167 nt, 176 - 186 nt, and 427 - 429 nt, as well as a six-base deletion in 487 - 492 nt, indicating that it was a current epidemic variant compared with the classical strain, CV777. No deletion occurred between 245 - 293 nt of the ORF3 gene in the JS201603 isolate compared with the vaccine isolates YY2013 and SQ2014. An experimental infection model indicated that the piglets in the challenge group successively developed diarrhea, exhibiting yellow-colored loose stools with a foul odor. The piglets in the JS201603 isolate challenge group displayed reduced food consumption, lost weight, and in severe cases even died. No abnormalities were observed in the control group. The JS201603 variant isolated in this study contributes to the evolutionary analysis of diarrhea virus.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines available in Italy in preventing hospitalization for influenza and pneumonia, a matched case-control study was performed in elderly subjects during the 2010\u20132011 season in Genoa (Italy). Cases and controls were matched in a 1:1 ratio according to gender, age, socio-economic status and type of influenza vaccine. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as IVE = [(1-OR)x100] and crude odds ratios were estimated through conditional logistic regression models. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated through multivariable logistic models. In the study area, influenza activity was moderate in the 2010\u20132011 season, with optimal matching between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. We recruited 187 case-control pairs; 46.5% of cases and 79.1% of controls had been vaccinated.

Repeated bacterial and viral RTI, such as pneumonia from encapsulated microorganisms, respiratory tract infections related to respiratory syncytial virus or influenza, and even the development of bronchiectasis and asthma, are often reported as the first symptom of primary immunodeficiencies. In the same way, neutropenia is a well-known risk factor for invasive aspergillosis, as well as lymphopenia for Pneumocystis, and mycobacterial infections. However, in the last decades a better knowledge of immune signaling networks and the introduction of next generation sequencing have increased the number and diversity of known inborn errors of immunity. On the other hand, the use of monoclonal antibodies targeting cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha has revealed new risk groups for infections, such as tuberculosis. The use of biological response modifiers has spread to almost all medical specialties, including inflammatory diseases and neoplasia, and are being used to target different signaling networks that may mirror some of the known immune deficiencies. From a clinical perspective, the individual contribution of genetics, and/or targeted treatments, to immune dysregulation is difficult to assess. The aim of this article is to review the known and newly described mechanisms of impaired immune signaling that predispose to RTI, including new insights into host genetics and the impact of biological response modifiers, and to summarize clinical recommendations regarding vaccines and prophylactic treatments in order to prevent infections.","publish_time":"2019-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lacoma, Alicia; Mateo, Lourdes; Blanco, Ignacio; M\u00E9ndez, Maria J.; Rodrigo, Carlos; Latorre, Irene; Villar-Hernandez, Raquel; Dom\u00EDnguez, Jose; Prat, Cristina","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1df0f9012de37de02b7af4bd23931f626c7bbc71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6513887.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134083/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory tract infections","mycobacterial infections","known immune deficiencies","immune dysregulation","well-known risk factor","new risk groups","host genetics","viral RTI","risk factors","use of biological response modifiers","better knowledge of immune","networks","impact of biological response modifiers","described mechanisms of impaired immune","respiratory syncytial virus","prophylactic treatments","new insights","targeted treatments","Host susceptibility","clinical recommendations","clinical perspective","individual contribution of genetics","use of monoclonal antibodies","tumor necrosis factor alpha","cytokines","pneumonia","encapsulated microorganisms","diversity","number","vaccines","lymphopenia","invasive aspergillosis","inflammatory diseases","medical specialties","generation sequencing","influenza","neutropenia","introduction","order","inborn errors of immunity","neoplasia","hand","way","decades","Pneumocystis","development of bronchiectasis","symptom of primary immunodeficiencies","asthma","article","tuberculosis","aim"],"language":"en"},

Despite it being known that certain mammalian cell phases are arrested by PEDV, the mechanisms have not been elucidated, and PEDV pathogenesis is poorly understood. This study determined the effect of an epidemic PEDV strain on cell cycle progression. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We observed the effect of the PEDV SHpd/2012 strain on an infected Vero cell cycle through flow cytometry and Western blot, investigating the interrelationships of cell-cycle arrest, the DNA damage\u2013signalling pathway caused by PEDV and the phosphorylation levels of the key molecules Chk.2 and H2A.X involved upstream and downstream in this pathway. RESULTS: PEDV induced Vero cell-cycle arrest at the G1/G0 phase. The phosphorylation levels of Chk.2 and H2A.X increased with the prolongation of PEDV infection, and no significant cell-cycle arrest was observed after treatment with ATM or Chk.2 inhibitors. The proliferation of PEDV was also inhibited by treatment with ATM or Chk.2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: PEDV-induced cell-cycle arrest is associated with activation of DNA damage\u2013signalling pathways. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis of PEDV replication and provide evidence to support further evaluation of PEDV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Yi-Ran; Zhou, Shu-Ting; Yang, Liang; Liu, Yuan-Ping; Jiang, Sheng-Yao; Dawuli, Yeliboli; Hou, Yi-Xuan; Zhou, Tian-Xing; Yang, Zhi-Biao","journal":"J Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fcf1cb78cf4b3258892739d3040bf5d0e0b8011.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105999.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2478/jvetres-2020-0024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32258796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV SHpd","proliferation of PEDV","PEDV-induced cell-cycle arrest","PEDV induced Vero cell-cycle arrest","epidemic PEDV strain","prolongation of PEDV infection","evaluation of PEDV pathogenesis","cell cycle progression","significant cell-cycle arrest","infected Vero cell cycle","interrelationships of cell","molecular basis of PEDV replication","phosphorylation levels of Chk","certain mammalian cell phases","key molecules Chk","H2A","effect","treatment","inhibitors","activation of DNA damage","Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","watery diarrhoea","signalling pathways","flow cytometry","Western blot","evidence","G1","neonatal piglets","weight loss","anorexia","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","G0 phase","morbidity","findings","CONCLUSION","METHODS","study","MATERIAL","mortality","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Vaccination is a promising strategy to protect human population. Reverse vaccinology is a more robust vaccine development approach especially with the availability of large-scale sequencing data and rapidly dropping cost of the techniques for acquiring such data from various organisms. The present study implements an immunoinformatic approach for screening the possible antigenic proteins among various pathogenic bacteria to systemically arrive at epitope-based vaccine candidates against 14 pathogenic bacteria. Thousand four hundred and fifty nine virulence factors and Five hundred and forty six products of essential genes were appraised as target proteins to predict potential epitopes with potential to stimulate different arms of the immune system. To address the self-tolerance, self-epitopes were identified by mapping on 1000 human proteome and were removed. Our analysis revealed that 21proteins from 5 bacterial species were found as virulent as well as essential to their survival, proved to be most suitable vaccine target against these species. In addition to the prediction of MHC-II binders, B cell and T cell epitopes as well as adjuvants individually from proteins of all 14 bacterial species, a stringent criteria lead us to identify 252 unique epitopes, which are predicted to be T-cell epitopes, B-cell epitopes, MHC II binders and Vaccine Adjuvants. In order to provide service to scientific community, we developed a web server VacTarBac for designing of vaccines against above species of bacteria. This platform integrates a number of tools that includes visualization tools to present antigenicity/epitopes density on an antigenic sequence. These tools will help users to identify most promiscuous vaccine candidates in a pathogenic antigen.

However, there is paucity of data from a large cohort, examining multiple biological specimens for diverse pathogens (bacteria and viruses). The Community Acquired Pneumonia Etiology Study (CAPES) was designed to address this knowledge gap. METHODS: We enrolled children with CAP (based on WHO IMCI criteria of tachypnea with cough or breathing difficulty) over 24 consecutive months, and recorded presenting symptoms, risk factors, clinical signs, and chest radiography. We performed blood and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) bacterial cultures, and serology (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae). We also performed multiplex PCR for 25 bacterial/viral species in a subgroup representing 20% of the cohort. Children requiring endotracheal intubation underwent culture and PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. FINDINGS: We enrolled 2345 children. NPA and blood cultures yielded bacteria in only 322 (13.7%) and 49 (2.1%) children respectively. In NPA, Streptococcus pneumoniae (79.1%) predominated, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (9.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.8%). In blood, S. aureus (30.6%) dominated, followed by S. pneumoniae (20.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.2%). M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae serology were positive in 4.3% and 1.1% respectively. Multiplex PCR in 428 NPA specimens identified organisms in 422 (98.6%); of these 352 (82.2%) had multiple organisms and only 70 (16.4%) had a single organism viz. S. pneumoniae: 35 (50%), Cytomegalovirus (CMV): 13 (18.6%), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV): 9 (12.9%), other viruses: 6 (8.7%), S. aureus: 5 (7.1%), and H. influenzae: 2 (2.9%). BAL PCR (n = 30) identified single pathogens in 10 (S. pneumoniae\u20133, CMV\u20133, S. aureus\u20132, H. influenzae\u20132) and multiple pathogens in 18 children. There were 108 (4.6%) deaths. The pattern of pathogens identified did not correlate with pneumonia severity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children with CAP have multiple pathogens (bacteria and viruses). S. pneumoniae and S. aureus predominate in NPA and blood respectively. CMV and RSV were the dominant respiratory viruses in NPA and BAL. The presence of multiple pathogens, especially organisms associated with nasopharyngeal carriage, precludes confirmation of a causal relationship in most cases.","publish_time":"2015-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mathew, Joseph L.; Singhi, Sunit; Ray, Pallab; Hagel, Eva; Saghafian\u2013Hedengren, Shanie; Bansal, Arun; Ygberg, Sofia; Sodhi, Kushaljit Singh; Kumar, B V Ravi; Nilsson, Anna","journal":"Journal of global health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1de0f645bef4bb4fa6244abca0b1e0396fdea449.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4623579.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26528392/; https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.05.020418","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus pneumoniae","Haemophilus","S. aureus","S. pneumoniae","M. pneumoniae","S. aureus\u20132"],"organizations":["NPA","Multiplex PCR","BAL PCR","RSV","BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumoniae serology","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Klebsiella pneumoniae","NPA specimens","presence of multiple pathogens","multiple organisms","single pathogens","diverse pathogens","pattern of pathogens","majority of children","multiple biological specimens","BAL PCR","multiplex PCR","blood cultures","CMV","Staphylococcus aureus","dominant respiratory viruses","bacterial cultures","PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage","Pneumonia Etiology Study","pneumonia severity","RSV","Haemophilus influenzae","confirmation of microbial etiology","nasopharyngeal aspirate","large cohort","nasopharyngeal carriage","Childhood community","single organism","Respiratory Syncytial Virus","recorded presenting symptoms","clinical signs","risk factors","developing countries","consecutive months","individual","significant problem","viral species","endotracheal intubation","cough","difficulty","IMCI criteria of tachypnea","subgroup","CAPES","chest radiography","causal relationship","paucity of data","BACKGROUND","public health","cases","mortality","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","knowledge gap","Cytomegalovirus","FINDINGS","deaths"],"language":"en"},

AIM: Our objective was to evaluate the effects that statutory adjustments in the Netherlands in 2008 and raising awareness during outbreaks had on notification timeliness. METHODS: In a retrospective analyses of routine surveillance data obtained between July 2003 and November 2017, delays between disease onset and laboratory confirmation (disease identification delay), between laboratory confirmation and notification to Municipal Health Services (notification delay) and between notification and reporting to the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (reporting delay) were analysed for 28 notifiable diseases. Delays before (period 1) and after the law change (periods 2 and 3) were compared with legal timeframes. We studied the effect of outbreak awareness in 10 outbreaks and the effect of specific guidance messages on disease identification delay for two diseases. RESULTS: We included 144,066 notifications. Average notification delay decreased from 1.4 to 0.4 days across the three periods (six diseases; p \u003C 0.05), reporting delay decreased mainly in period 2 (from 0.5 to 0.1 days, six diseases; p \u003C 0.05). In 2016\u20132017, legal timeframes were met overall. Awareness resulted in decreased disease identification delay for three diseases: measles and rubella (outbreaks) and psittacosis (specific guidance messages). CONCLUSIONS: Legal adjustments decreased notification and reporting delays, increased awareness reduced identification delays. As disease identification delay dominates the notification chain, insight in patient, doctor and laboratory delay is necessary to further improve timeliness and monitor the impact of control measures during outbreaks.","publish_time":"2019-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Swaan, Corien M; Wong, Albert; Bona\u010Di\u0107 Marinovi\u0107, Axel; Kretzschmar, Mirjam EE; van Steenbergen, Jim E","journal":"Euro Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d933299806fcd4e9e8a61e7760267154926c05ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6905299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822327/; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2019.24.49.1900237","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Municipal Health Services"],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["laboratory delay","Average notification delay","decreased disease identification delay","notification timeliness","notification chain","identification delays","Timely notification of infectious diseases","outbreaks","reporting delays","disease onset","notifiable diseases","effective disease control","laboratory confirmation","increased awareness","Legal adjustments","legal timeframes","effect of outbreak awareness","effect of specific guidance messages","periods","days","Public Health","statutory adjustments","Municipal Health Services","impact of control measures","doctor","insight","patient","National Institute","psittacosis","Environment","measles","retrospective analyses of routine surveillance data","effects","Netherlands","regular evaluation","rubella","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","law change","objective","METHODS","RESULTS","notifications","AIM"],"language":"en"},

Access to diagnostic point-of-care tests (POCTs) for RTIs might reduce this over-prescription. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to determine the diagnostic performance and clinical feasibility of a recently developed diagnostic POCT for respiratory viruses, the mariPOC(\u00AE), in a Dutch primary healthcare setting. METHODS: In patients with RTI symptoms presenting to a family practice during the 2015\u20132016 winter season, we determined the test\u2019s sensitivity and specificity relative to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing performed in a laboratory. The clinical feasibility of the POCT was evaluated by interviewing general practitioners (GPs). RESULTS: One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 54.9% of the patients (n = 204). For influenza A virus (n = 24), sensitivity of the POCT was 54.2% and specificity was 98.9%; for influenza B virus (n = 18), sensitivity was 72.2% and specificity 99.5%; and for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 12), sensitivity was 50.0% and specificity 100%. In samples with higher viral load, sensitivity was 85.7% for influenza A, 78.6% for influenza B and 85.7% for RSV. The availability of a diagnostic test for respiratory viruses was appreciated by both patients and GPs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that diagnostic POCTs for respiratory viruses might contribute to a precise and evidence-based diagnosis of RTIs and could positively influence prescription of antibiotics by GPs. However, before implementation in primary healthcare, diagnostic accuracy of the POCT needs improvement and it is impact on clinical decision making should be further assessed.","publish_time":"2017-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bruning, Andrea H L; de Kruijf, Wilhelmina B; van Weert, Henk C P M; Willems, Wim L M; de Jong, Menno D; Pajkrt, Dasja; Wolthers, Katja C","journal":"Fam Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f899112f64cbf1e290a1aa0d5d7625fa96c4656.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108454.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmx019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28369370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POCT","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","diagnostic POCTs","diagnostic accuracy","diagnostic point","diagnostic performance","diagnostic test","respiratory syncytial virus","test\u2019s sensitivity","influenza B virus","patients","GPs","respiratory tract infections","specificity relative","clinical feasibility","primary health care","study","prescription of antibiotics","RSV","Dutch primary healthcare setting","clinical decision making","care tests","evidence-based diagnosis of RTIs","over-prescription","high levels of antibiotics","polymerase chain reaction","PCR","testing","RTI symptoms","impact","improvement","samples","higher viral load","implementation","family practice","BACKGROUND","winter season","METHODS","general practitioners","availability","mariPOC","laboratory","OBJECTIVE","purpose","Access","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Here, we examined the dynamics of CD4\u002BFoxp3\u002B regulatory T (Treg) cells within this inflammatory and highly Th1-polarized environment. Treg cells showed a reduced proliferation rate and their frequency is progressively reduced along infection compared to effector T (Teff) cells. Also, a higher fraction of Treg cells showed a na\u00EFve phenotype, meanwhile Teff cells were mostly of the effector memory type. T. cruzi infection was associated with the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-27p28, and with the induction of T-bet and IFN-\u03B3 expression in Treg cells. Furthermore, endogenous glucocorticoids released in response to T. cruzi-driven immune activation were crucial to sustain the Treg/Teff cell balance. Notably, IL-2 plus dexamethasone combined treatment before infection was associated with increased Treg cell proliferation and expression of GATA-3, IL-4 and IL-10, and increased mice survival time. Overall, our results indicate that therapies aimed at specifically boosting Treg cells, which during T. cruzi infection are overwhelmed by the effector immune response, represent new opportunities for the treatment of Chagas disease, which is actually only based on parasite-targeted chemotherapy.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonz\u00E1lez, Florencia B.; Villar, Silvina R.; Fern\u00E1ndez Bussy, Rodrigo; Martin, Ga\u00EBlle H.; P\u00E9rol, Louis; Manarin, Romina; Spinelli, Silvana V.; Pilon, Caroline; Cohen, Jos\u00E9 Laurent; Bottasso, Oscar A.; Piaggio, Eliane; P\u00E9rez, Ana R.","journal":"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e92122ce25ebe0f1793d8ad3a72c51a9de790197.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126853.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159114005601; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159114005601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25483139/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2014.11.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Treg/Teff"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Teff cells","higher fraction of Treg cells","Trypanosoma cruzi infection","lethal infection","increased Treg cell proliferation","effector T","IL-27p28","effector immune response","regulatory T","mice results","Teff cell balance","induction of T","production of","reduced proliferation rate","effector memory type","anti-inflammatory mediators production","expression of GATA","increased mice survival time","immune activation","IFN-\u03B3 expression","dexamethasone combined treatment","treatment of Chagas disease","new opportunities","na\u00EFve phenotype","Foxp3","C57BL","frequency","dynamics of CD4","Th1-polarized environment","cytokines","therapies","endogenous glucocorticoids","parasite-targeted chemotherapy"],"language":"en"},

Although some guidelines for patient care in orthopaedic practice have been published, overall, publications focusing exclusively on guidelines on starting orthopaedic outpatient departments (OPD) after the COVID-19 lockdown amidst the on-going pandemic are lacking. We hereby propose the evolving knowledge in changes in OPD management practices for orthopaedic surgeons in the COVID- 19 era. The emphasis on online registration (e-registration) should be given impetus and become the new norm supplemented by telephonic and spot registration for the uneducated patients. The review highlights the safety of patient and orthopaedic surgeons in OPD by screening and maintaining hygiene at various levels. The article also mentions the duties of the help desk, OPD hall supervisor and the new norms of Air Conditioning, ventilation, safe use of elevators, sanitization of OPD premises and biomedical waste disposal. The optimum and safe utilization of human \u0026 material resources, DO\u0027s and DON\u0027Ts for patients \u0026 health staff have also been proposed. The reorganization of plaster room, the precaution during plastering, fracture clinic, dressing and injection room services are discussed as per evolving guidelines. This article will give deep insight into the OPD plan \u0026telemedicine graphically also. The authors suggest updating and downward permeation of existing e-infrastructure of government health services that is up-gradation of existing tertiary level online registration services, a paperless model of OPD Consultation \u0026 dispensation. The future updating of Aarogya Setu App (https://mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/). for convenient online OPD registration and dispensation has been discussed and proposed. This review will help in containing the spread of COVID 19 and build upon the health gains achieved after lockdown. The easy concept of CCCATTT has been introduced, and the OPD Plan has also been suggested. We have endeavoured to holistically detail an orthopaedic OPD setup and its upkeep in COVID-19 pandemic, but since the knowledge of COVID 19 is ever-evolving it needs replenishment by regular education for health staff.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lal, Hitesh; Sharma, Deepak Kumar; Patralekh, Mohit Kumar; Jain, Vijay Kumar; Maini, Lalit","journal":"Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Trauma","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0976566220301776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425430/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.05.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0976566220301776?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","OPD","Air Conditioning","OPD Consultation","Aarogya Setu App","OPD Plan"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OPD plan","orthopaedic OPD setup","convenient online OPD registration","OPD management practices","sanitization of OPD premises","OPD hall supervisor","orthopaedic surgeons","orthopaedic practice","knowledge of COVID","e-registration","health staff","spread of COVID","paperless model of OPD Consultation","spot registration","government health services","health gains","evolving guidelines","orthopaedic outpatient departments","evolving knowledge","World Health Organization","gradation of existing tertiary level online registration services","injection room services","dispensation","consequent lockdown","on-going pandemic","article","review","Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COVID","safety of patient","patient care","uneducated patients","help desk","downward permeation of existing e-infrastructure","safe use of elevators","safe utilization of human","reorganization of plaster room","new norms of Air Conditioning","ventilation","material resources","precaution","DO\u0027s","DON\u0027Ts","screening","changes","fracture clinic","plastering","upkeep","biomedical waste disposal","deep insight","areas","hygiene","replenishment","regular education","marked reduction","duties","future","Aarogya Setu App","various levels","impetus","telemedicine","emphasis","easy concept of CCCATTT","authors","era","publications"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of 9 infectious agents in gastrointestinal (GI)\u2010diseased and healthy foals with ages ranging from 1 to 20 weeks of age and to what degree coinfections are associated with clinical signs of GI disease. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective controlled observational study. METHODS: The population consisted of 88 Thoroughbred foals aged 2 days to 17 weeks born on 32 different studfarms in Kentucky. Healthy (n = 37) and GI\u2010diseased (n = 51) foals were identified based on clinical presentation. Faecal samples were analysed for 9 infectious agents by real\u2010time PCR: equine rotavirus, equine coronavirus, Clostridium difficile toxins A \u0026 B, Neorickettsia risticii, Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin, Lawsonia intracellularis, Rhodococcus equi, Cryptosporidium spp., and Salmonella spp. Salmonella was also cultured from overnight selenite enrichment broth. RESULTS: The prevalence of infectious pathogens under study was between 0% (Lawsonia intracellularis) and 34.6% (equine rotavirus). The overall prevalence for any infectious agent was 63.2% in the GI\u2010diseased group and 43.2% in the healthy group. Coinfections were significantly more frequent in the sick group (15 monoinfections vs. 22 coinfections) than in the healthy group (12 vs. 4, respectively, P = 0.0002). Six of the 8 infectious agents were associated with the GI\u2010diseased group, the other 2 were not (equine coronavirus and R. equi). CONCLUSIONS: The use of panels rather than individual tests in combination with quantitative toxin gene analysis enables detection of coinfections significantly associated with risk of disease. Several infectious diseases previously not tested for or considered unimportant were found at high prevalence and require further investigation.","publish_time":"2013-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slovis, N.

In this report we present new data showing that some immunoregulatory peptides associated with the main immunoglobulin class, IgY, are also present in the avian immune system. Cytokine-inducing activity of particular fractions obtained from ovine colostrum, IgG\u002B (IgG(2) containing PRP), IgG\u2212 (IgG(2) free of PRP), and purified PRP, was compared with that of crude egg yolk IgY (IgY\u002B), additionally purified egg yolk IgY (IgY\u2212), and polypeptides accompanying IgY named Yolkin (Y), using an ex vivo model of whole human blood cells. It was shown that both IgG\u002B fraction and PRP, but not IgG\u2212, stimulated the whole blood cells to release tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 and interleukin-1\u03B2 cytokines. Similar experiments performed with hen\u0027s egg IgY preparations showed that IgY\u002B and Y samples showed higher cytokine-inducing activity than samples additionally purified with the use of size exclusion chromatography (IgY\u2212). The IgY\u002B at a dose of 100 \u03BCg was even more active than the positive lipopolysaccharide control. It was also found that Y is able to stimulate macrophage cell line J774.2 to release nitric oxide.

Although the use of acetylsalicylic acid (AAS) in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) remains the standard therapy to KD, the etiology, genetic susceptibility genes and pathogenic factors of KD are still un-elucidated. Purpose Current obstacles in the treatment of KD include the lack of standard clinical and genetic markers for early diagnosis, possible severe side effect of AAS (Reye\u0027s syndrome), and the refractory KD cases with resistance to IVIG therapy, therefore, this review has focused on introducing the current advances in the identification of genetic susceptibility genes, environmental factors, diagnostic markers and adjuvant pharmacological intervention for KD. Results With an overall update in the development of KD from different aspects, our current bioinformatics data has suggested CASP3, CD40 and TLR4 as the possible pathogenic factors or diagnostic markers of KD. Besides, a list of herbal medicines which may work as the adjunct therapy for KD via targeting different proposed molecular targets of KD have also been summarized.

This sequence is followed by a larger duplication which encompasses the region coding for the protein p80(LD), a molecular marker for cpBVDV. The SD element codes for the viral protease p20. In the case of the viruses analyzed here the aminoterminus of p80 is generated by autoproteolytic removal of the preceding SD-encoded protease. For one of the cpBVDV isolates a specific fusion protein (p28) could be identified which is composed of p20 and part of p10, another viral protein.

The causative agent, 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV), has spread rapidly to more than 25 countries worldwide. Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections outside Wuhan. Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients. METHODS: We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province. RESULTS: The median age of the 26 patients with COVID-19 in this study was 42 years. The most common occupation was retail staff (16 patients, 61.54%), with 11 patients or their family members working at the same supermarket. Only 2 patients had visited Wuhan since December 2019; the other cases of 2019-nCoV infection arose from patient-to-patient transmission. Twelve patients had more than one sign or symptom; however, seven patients had no sign or symptom. The average time from symptom onset to admission was 4.5 days. CT revealed signs of bronchitis in 2 patients and unilateral and bilateral pneumonia in 9 and 15 patients, respectively. The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%). Most patients (25/26) required \u22651 treatment. DISCUSSION: In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan. Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people. Close monitoring is essential for preventing the large-scale spread of the virus in such places.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Lizhen; Duan, Yueting; Zhang, Wenming; Liang, Juan; Xu, Jianxiang; Zhang, Yongqing; Wu, Changgang; Xu, Yangling; Li, Hua","journal":"Clin Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd4534d957fa949dc34fd5281a423ebbe1cf83c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154005.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308494/; https://doi.org/10.2147/clep.s249903","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital","CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["clinical characteristics of infected patients","confirmed COVID","Wuhan","patient transmission","human transmission","disease etiology","symptom onset","supermarket","family members","nCoV infection","active viral transmission","clinical features","Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital","novel CoV","previous reports","cases of coronavirus","large-scale spread","Close monitoring","close contact","location","admission","Shandong Province","antiviral therapy","average time","retail staff","following treatments","contrast","bilateral pneumonia","common occupation","signs of bronchitis","median age","causative agent","DISCUSSION","days","individuals","genomics","gastric mucosal protection","large number of people","antibiotics","Chinese medicine","RESULTS","places","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","study","studies","date","years","immunotherapy","infections","China","countries","glucocorticoids"],"language":"en"},

Symptoms typically associated with wet feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) including ascites, abdominal distention or pleural effusion, coupled in many cases with non-antibiotic responsive fever, were observed in 19% (32/169) of cats, and 75% (24/32) of these cats were FCoV seropositive. FCoV seropositivity was also associated with a high white blood cell count, high plasma globulin, low plasma albumin and low blood urea nitrogen. The percentage of FCoV seropositive and seronegative cats that died in spite of supportive veterinary treatment was 33% (21/63) and 12% (13/106), respectively. These results indicate that FCoV is widespread and has a severe clinical impact in cats from Istanbul. Moreover, the incidence of FCoV infections could be rising, and in the absence of effective vaccination cat owners need to be made aware of ways to minimize the spread of this virus.","publish_time":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tekelioglu, B.

The viral 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) have been involved in the regulation of several molecular mechanisms. However, in astrovirues have been less characterized. Here, we analyzed the secondary structures of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR of HAstV, as well as their putative target sites that might be recognized by cellular factors. To our knowledge, this is the first bioinformatic analysis that predicts the HAstV 5\u2032 UTR secondary structure. The analysis showed that both the UTR sequence and secondary structure are highly conserved in all HAstVs analyzed, suggesting their regulatory role of viral activities. Notably, the UTRs of HAstVs contain putative binding sites for the serine/arginine-rich factors SRSF2, SRSF5, SRSF6, SRSF3, and the multifunctional hnRNPE2 protein. More importantly, putative binding sites for PTB were localized in single-stranded RNA sequences, while hnRNPE2 sites were localized in double-stranded sequence of the HAstV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR structures. These analyses suggest that the combination of SRSF proteins, hnRNPE2 and PTB described here could be involved in the maintenance of the secondary structure of the HAstVs, possibly allowing the recruitment of the replication complex that selects and recruits viral RNA replication templates.

In April 2011, nasal swabs were collected for virus isolation from pigs exhibiting influenza-like illness. Subsequent electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic studies identified an orthomyxovirus with seven RNA segments exhibiting approximately 50% overall amino acid identity to human influenza C virus. Based on its genetic organizational similarities to influenza C viruses this virus has been provisionally designated C/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK). Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted viral proteins found that the divergence between C/OK and human influenza C viruses was similar to that observed between influenza A and B viruses. No cross reactivity was observed between C/OK and human influenza C viruses using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Additionally, screening of pig and human serum samples found that 9.5% and 1.3%, respectively, of individuals had measurable HI antibody titers to C/OK virus. C/OK virus was able to infect both ferrets and pigs and transmit to naive animals by direct contact. Cell culture studies showed that C/OK virus displayed a broader cellular tropism than a human influenza C virus. The observed difference in cellular tropism was further supported by structural analysis showing that hemagglutinin esterase (HE) proteins between two viruses have conserved enzymatic but divergent receptor-binding sites. These results suggest that C/OK virus represents a new subtype of influenza C viruses that currently circulates in pigs that has not been recognized previously. The presence of multiple subtypes of co-circulating influenza C viruses raises the possibility of reassortment and antigenic shift as mechanisms of influenza C virus evolution.","publish_time":"2013-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hause, Ben M.; Ducatez, Mariette; Collin, Emily A.; Ran, Zhiguang; Liu, Runxia; Sheng, Zizhang; Armien, Anibal; Kaplan, Bryan; Chakravarty, Suvobrata; Hoppe, Adam D.; Webby, Richard J.; Simonson, Randy R.; Li, Feng","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2df20f5c298fe15e93bc70a752c8566c367f0faa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3567177.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23408893/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human influenza C viruses","designated C","OK virus","new subtype of influenza C viruses","mechanisms of influenza C virus evolution","presence of multiple subtypes of co-circulating influenza C viruses","virus isolation","B viruses","Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses","pigs","human serum samples","non-human maintenance hosts","genetic studies","observed difference","broader cellular tropism","structural analysis","Phylogenetic analysis","genetic organizational similarities","predicted viral proteins","Cell culture studies","measurable HI antibody titers","hemagglutination inhibition","possibility of reassortment","antigenic shift","divergence","amino acid identity","divergent receptor-binding sites","naive animals","Subsequent electron microscopic","individuals","orthomyxovirus","hemagglutinin esterase","screening of pig","ferrets","direct contact","RNA segments","assays","nasal swabs","Oklahoma","results","cross reactivity","illness"],"language":"en"},

This can happen at the innate immune system level\u2014often called trained immunity or innate immune memory\u2014and/or at the adaptive immune system level involving T memory cells and antibodies. Viruses may also induce T cell-mediated H.I., which can confer protection or drive immunopathology against other virus subtypes, related or unrelated viruses, other pathogens, auto- or allo-antigens. It is important to understand the underlying mechanisms for the development of antiviral \u201Cuniversal\u201D vaccines and broader T cell responses rather than just subtype-specific antibody responses as in the case of influenza. Furthermore, knowledge about determinants of vaccine-mediated H.I. may inform public health policies and provide suggestions for repurposing existing vaccines. Here, we introduce H.I. and provide an overview of evidence on virus- and antiviral vaccine-induced T cell-mediated cross-reactive responses. We also discuss the factors influencing final clinical outcome of virus-mediated H.I. as well as non-specific beneficial effects of live attenuated antiviral vaccines such as measles and vaccinia. Available epidemiological and mechanistic data have implications both for the development of new vaccines and for personalized vaccinology, which are presented.

Although major efforts to control M. hyopneumoniae infection and its detrimental effects have been made, significant economic losses in pig production worldwide due to EP continue. M. hyopneumoniae is typically introduced into pig herds by the purchase of subclinically infected animals or, less frequently, through airborne transmission over short distances. Once in the herd, M. hyopneumoniae may be transmitted by direct contact from infected sows to their offspring or between pen mates. The \u2018gold standard\u2019 technique used to diagnose M. hyopneumoniae infection, bacteriological culture, is laborious and is seldom used routinely. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction detection methods, in addition to post-mortem inspection in the form of abattoir surveillance or field necropsy, are the techniques most frequently used to investigate the potential involvement of M. hyopneumoniae in porcine respiratory disease. Such techniques have been used to monitor the incidence of M. hyopneumoniae infection in herds both clinically and subclinically affected by EP, in vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds and under different production and management conditions. Differences in the clinical course of EP at farm level and in the efficacy of M. hyopneumoniae vaccination suggest that the transmission and virulence characteristics of different field isolates of M. hyopneumoniae may vary. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the epidemiology of M. hyopneumoniae infection including its transmission, infection and seroconversion dynamics and also compares the various epidemiological tools used to monitor EP.","publish_time":"2009-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sibila, Marina; Pieters, Maria; Molitor, Thomas; Maes, Dominiek; Haesebrouck, Freddy; Segal\u00E9s, Joaquim","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/826568210030f343528973bfd72d8cc979416f59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18396428/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023308000816; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023308000816; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.02.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hyopneumoniae infection","hyopneumoniae vaccination","Abstract Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae","pig herds","different production","pig production","non-vaccinated herds","clinical course of EP","airborne transmission","techniques","porcine respiratory disease","chronic respiratory disease","field necropsy","infected sows","purchase of subclinically infected animals","virulence characteristics of different field isolates","polymerase chain reaction detection methods","addition","principal aetiological agent of enzootic pneumonia","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","post-mortem inspection","form of abattoir surveillance","offspring","farm level","significant economic losses","epidemiology","direct contact","seroconversion dynamics","current state of knowledge","detrimental effects","efficacy","bacteriological culture","management conditions","potential involvement","various epidemiological tools","paper","short distances","Differences","major efforts","incidence","pen mates","gold standard","pigs"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the current study was to assess research activity on climate change and health with an emphasis on infectious diseases. METHOD: A bibliometric method was applied using SciVerse Scopus. Documents on climate change and human health were called \u201Chealth-related literature\u201D while documents on climate change and infectious diseases were called \u201Cinfection-related literature\u201D. The study period was from 1980 to 2019. RESULTS: The search query found 4247 documents in the health-related literature and 1207 in the infection-related literature. The growth of publications showed a steep increase after 2007. There were four research themes in the health-related literature: (1) climate change and infectious diseases; (2) climate change, public health and food security; (3) heat waves, mortality, and non-communicable diseases; and (4) climate change, air pollution, allergy, and respiratory health. The most frequently encountered pathogens/infectious diseases in the infection-related literature were malaria and dengue. Documents in infection-related literature had a higher h-index than documents in the health-related literature. The top-cited documents in the health-related literature focused on food security, public health, and infectious diseases while those in infection-related literature focused on water-, vector-, and mosquito-borne diseases. The European region had the highest contribution in health-related literature (n = 1626; 38.3%) and infection-related literature (n = 497; 41.2%). The USA led with 1235 (29.1%) documents in health-related literature and 365 (30.2%) documents in infection-related literature. The Australian National University ranked first in the health-related literature while the London School of Hygiene \u0026 Tropical Medicine ranked first in the infection-related literature. International research collaboration was inadequate. Documents published in the Environmental Health Perspectives journal received the highest citations per document. A total of 1416 (33.3%) documents in the health-related literature were funded while 419 (34.7%) documents in the infection-related literature were funded. CONCLUSION: Research on climate change and human health is on the rise with research on infection-related issues making a good share. International research collaboration should be funded and supported. Future research needs to focus on the impact of climate change on psychosocial, mental, innovations, policies, and preparedness of health systems.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sweileh, Waleed M.","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad9b8772ec3cede67f0c316c954a95aa58a285f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206222.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00576-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384901/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SciVerse Scopus","USA","National University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health-related literature","infection-related literature","infection-related issues","public health","human health","respiratory health","preparedness of health systems","infectious diseases","cited documents","impact of climate change","Environmental Health Perspectives journal","research activity","Future research","research themes","International research collaboration","non-communicable diseases","food security","highest contribution","highest citations","adaptive policies","bibliometric method","current study","study period","planning future protective","London School of Hygiene","allergy","air pollution","heat waves","mortality","higher h-index","Tropical Medicine","innovations","rise","emphasis","water","malaria","European region","search query","good share","encountered pathogens","growth of publications","steep increase","SciVerse Scopus","vector","BACKGROUND","dengue","CONCLUSION","Australian National University","RESULTS","objective","mosquito","USA","total"],"language":"en"},

ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1\u20137 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system. rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively. Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gheblawi, Mahmoud; Wang, Kaiming; Viveiros, Anissa; Nguyen, Quynh; Zhong, Jiu-Chang; Turner, Anthony J.; Raizada, Mohan K.; Grant, Maria B.; Oudit, Gavin Y.","journal":"Circ Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86a229706aec3f00c648911fc5713e47e03732ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188049.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.120.317015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32264791/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 system","Recombinant ACE2","human ACE2 receptor","ACE2 action","critical role of ACE2","novel SARS-CoV","recombinant human ACE2","loss of ACE2 function","cardiovascular system","receptor-binding domain of SARS","coronavirus disease","activated renin-angiotensin system","greater pathogenicity of SARS","lung disease","disease conditions","central nervous system","Mas receptor agonists","increased plasma angiotensin","cardiovascular diseases","critical link","negative regulator","diabetic cardiovascular complications","critical protective pathway","stronger binding affinity","facilitator of amino acid transport","key amino acid residues","trivalent function","severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","control of gut dysbiosis","essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension","heart failure","preserved ejection fraction","kidneys","inflammation","myocardial infarction","infective agent responsible","vascular permeability","clinical trials","potential therapies","analogs","pandemic","gene-delivery","implications","activation of proteolytic cleavage","years","adipose tissue","endocytosis","immunity","close evolutionary relationship","multiplicity of physiological roles","progress","processing","diabetes mellitus","rhACE2","enzyme","lungs","review","levels"],"language":"en"},

However, the multifaceted nature of AMR often complicates the development and implementation of comprehensive policies. In this study, we describe the policy context and explore experts\u2019 perspectives on the challenges, facilitators, and strategies for combating AMR in Singapore. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 participants. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and were analyzed thematically, adopting an interpretative approach. Participants reported that the Ministry of Health (MOH) has effectively funded AMR control programs and research in all public hospitals. In addition, a preexisting One Health platform, among MOH, Agri-Food \u0026 Veterinary Authority (restructured to form the Singapore Food Agency and the Animal \u0026 Veterinary Service under NParks in April 2019), National Environment Agency, and Singapore\u2019s National Water Agency, was perceived to have facilitated the coordination and formulation of Singapore\u2019s AMR strategies. Nonetheless, participants highlighted that the success of AMR strategies is compounded by various challenges such as surveillance in private clinics, resource constraints at community-level health facilities, sub-optimal public awareness, patchy regulation on antimicrobial use in animals, and environmental contamination. This study shows that the process of planning and executing AMR policies is complicated even in a well-resourced country such as Singapore. It has also highlighted the increasing need to address the social, political, cultural, and behavioral aspects influencing AMR. Ultimately, it will be difficult to design policy interventions that cater for the needs of individuals, families, and the community, unless we understand how all these aspects interact and shape the AMR response.","publish_time":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Shweta Rajkumar; Chua, Alvin Qijia; Tan, Sok Teng; Tam, Clarence C.; Hsu, Li Yang; Legido-Quigley, Helena","journal":"Antibiotics (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/328b36edcc6169a2aceba2c7e6859d1770d6a81d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6963657.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics8040201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMR in Singapore","the Ministry of Health","Agri-Food \u0026 Veterinary Authority","Singapore Food Agency and the Animal \u0026 Veterinary Service","National Environment Agency","AMR"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["AMR policies","AMR response","success of AMR strategies","formulation of Singapore\u2019s AMR strategies","multifaceted nature of AMR","funded AMR control programs","participants","Singapore Food Agency","Health platform","Ministry of Health","global public health threat","community-level health facilities","public hospitals","MOH","National Environment Agency","Singapore\u2019s National Water Agency","study","sub-optimal public awareness","antimicrobial use","various challenges","Agri-Food","Veterinary Service","Veterinary Authority","Antimicrobial resistance","policy context","policy interventions","behavioral aspects","implementation of comprehensive policies","semi-structured interviews","patchy regulation","resource constraints","private clinics","animals","surveillance","research","experts\u2019 perspectives","development","facilitators","urgent attention","NParks","preexisting","process of planning","coordination","environmental contamination","needs of individuals","families","addition","increasing need","well-resourced country","interpretative approach"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally, putative short open reading frames (sORFs) coding for less than 100 amino acids were disregarded due to computational and experimental limitations; however, it has become clear over the past several years that translation of sORFs is pervasive and serves diverse functions. The development of ribosome profiling, allowing identification of translated sequences genome wide, revealed wide spread, previously unidentified translation events. New computational methodologies as well as improved mass spectrometry approaches also contributed to the task of annotating translated sORFs in different organisms. Viruses are of special interest due to the selective pressure on their genome size, their rapid and confining evolution, and the potential contribution of novel peptides to the host immune response. Indeed, many functional viral sORFs were characterized to date, and ribosome profiling analyses suggest that this may be the tip of the iceberg. Our computational analyses of sORFs identified by ribosome profiling in DNA viruses demonstrate that they may be enriched in specific features implying that at least some of them are functional.

Molecular tools have proven useful in discovering and characterizing emerging viruses and bacteria such as Sin Nombre virus (hantaviral pulmonary syndrome), hepatitis C virus, Bartonella henselae (cat scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis).

SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes 22 N-linked glycan sequons per protomer, which likely play a role in protein folding and immune evasion. Here, using a site-specific mass spectrometric approach, we reveal the glycan structures on a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen.

The unclear comprehension and negative attitudes towards the emerging infectious disease among general population may lead to unnecessary worry and even panic. The objective of this study was to investigate the Chinese public response to H1N1 pandemic and provide baseline data to develop public education campaigns in response to future outbreaks. METHODS: A close-ended questionnaire developed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention was applied to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 among 10,669 responders recruited from seven urban and two rural areas of China sampled by using the probability proportional to size (PPS) method. RESULTS: 30.0% respondents were not clear whether food spread H1N1 virusand. 65.7% reported that the pandemic had no impact on their life. The immunization rates of the seasonal flu and H1N1vaccine were 7.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Farmers and those with lower education level were less likely to know the main transmission route (cough or talk face to face). Female and those with college and above education had higher perception of risk and more compliance with preventive behaviors. Relationships between knowledge and risk perception (OR = 1.69; 95%CI 1.54-1.86), and knowledge and practices (OR = 1.57; 95%CI 1.42-1.73) were found among the study subjects. With regard to the behavior of taking up A/H1N1 vaccination, there are several related factors found in the current study population, including the perception of life disturbed (OR = 1.29; 95%CI 1.11-1.50), the safety of A/H1N1 vaccine (OR = 0.07; 95%CI 0.04-0.11), the knowledge of free vaccination policy (OR = 7.20; 95%CI 5.91-8.78), the state\u0027s priority vaccination strategy(OR = 1.33; 95%CI 1.08-1.64), and taking up seasonal influenza vaccine behavior (OR = 4.69; 95%CI 3.53-6.23). CONCLUSIONS: This A/H1N1 epidemic has not caused public panic yet, but the knowledge of A/H1N1 in residents is not optimistic. Public education campaign may take the side effects of vaccine and the knowledge about the state\u0027s vaccination strategy into account.","publish_time":"2011-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yilan; Huang, Lijuan; Nie, Shaofa; Liu, Zengyan; Yu, Hongjie; Yan, Weirong; Xu, Yihua","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe954b75ed45c02d47090ee70d25c726b24b081c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3112099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21575222/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-128","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Farmers"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 pandemic","H1N1 vaccination","H1N1 vaccine","H1N1 epidemic","public education campaigns","risk perception","public panic","knowledge of free vaccination policy","food spread H1N1 virusand","Chinese public response","state\u0027s vaccination strategy","higher perception of risk","current study population","state\u0027s priority vaccination strategy","general population","huge population","greatest risk","lower education level","perception of life disturbed","face","effects of vaccine","seasonal influenza vaccine behavior","study subjects","practices","negative attitudes","Chinese Center","Disease Control","seasonal flu","emerging infectious disease","rural areas of China","baseline data","cough","compliance","Prevention","related factors","main transmission route","KAP","probability proportional","future outbreaks","size","PPS","respondents","questionnaire","high residential density","college","immunization rates","unclear comprehension","H1N1vaccine","preventive behaviors","unnecessary worry","Farmers","BACKGROUND","account","residents","Relationships","METHODS","responders","CONCLUSIONS","impact","safety","RESULTS","Female","regard","objective"],"language":"en"},

Libraries possessed greater than 99% of all 11,860 programmed mutations. Golden Gate cloning was then used to assemble the complete \u03A6X174 mutant genome and generate libraries of infective viruses. This protocol will enable reverse genetics experiments for studying viral evolution and, with some modifications, can be applied for engineering of therapeutically relevant bacteriophages with larger genomes.","publish_time":"2019-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faber, Matthew S.; Van Leuven, James T.; Ederer, Martina M.; Sapozhnikov, Yesol; Wilson, Zo\u00EB L.; Wichman, Holly A.; Whitehead, Timothy A.; Miller, Craig R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cc8b739af196de61b6d01e86a8e1c050a638be8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f0f3f4ab41fdd2d12c3fa45dc53a17d7c58a4068.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/798546","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutant libraries","comprehensive single-site mutagenesis libraries of genes","amino acids","libraries of infective viruses","\u03A6X174 genome","construction of saturation single-site","complete \u03A6X174 mutant genome","massive multi-site","golden gate assembly","Golden Gate cloning","used nicking mutagenesis","novel protocol","F capsid protein","G spike protein","non-replicative fragments compatible","unamplified oligo pools","templates","oligonucleotides","viral evolution","individual segments","reverse genetics experiments","relevant bacteriophages","engineering","larger genomes","modifications","programmed mutations"],"language":"en"},

The presence of antigenically disparate pulmonary viruses and the emergence of novel viruses assures the recurrence of lung damage with infection and resolution of each primary viral infection. Thus, there is a need to develop safe broad spectrum immunoprophylactic strategies capable of enhancing protective immune responses in the lung but which limits immune-mediated lung damage. The immunoprophylactic strategy described here utilizes a protein cage nanoparticle (PCN) to significantly accelerate clearance of diverse respiratory viruses after primary infection and also results in a host immune response that causes less lung damage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice pre-treated with PCN, independent of any specific viral antigens, were protected against both sub-lethal and lethal doses of two different influenza viruses, a mouse-adapted SARS-coronavirus, or mouse pneumovirus. Treatment with PCN significantly increased survival and was marked by enhanced viral clearance, accelerated induction of viral-specific antibody production, and significant decreases in morbidity and lung damage. The enhanced protection appears to be dependent upon the prior development of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in the lung in response to the PCN treatment and to be mediated through CD4\u002B T cell and B cell dependent mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The immunoprophylactic strategy described utilizes an infection-independent induction of naturally occurring iBALT prior to infection by a pulmonary viral pathogen. This strategy non-specifically enhances primary immunity to respiratory viruses and is not restricted by the antigen specificities inherent in typical vaccination strategies. PCN treatment is asymptomatic in its application and importantly, ameliorates the damaging inflammation normally associated with the recruitment of immune responses into the lung.","publish_time":"2009-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wiley, James A.; Richert, Laura E.; Swain, Steve D.; Harmsen, Ann; Barnard, Dale L.; Randall, Troy D.; Jutila, Mark; Douglas, Trevor; Broomell, Chris; Young, Mark; Harmsen, Allen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2743193.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19774076/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007142","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune-mediated lung damage","primary viral infection","recurrence of lung damage","viral clearance","primary infection","PCN treatment","pulmonary viral pathogen","pulmonary viral infections","recruitment of immune responses","disparate pulmonary viruses","accelerated induction of viral","specific viral antigens","infection-independent induction","immunoprophylactic strategy","protective immune responses","host immune response","clearance of diverse respiratory viruses","different influenza viruses","emergence of novel viruses","iBALT","primary immunity","host-generated inflammation","T cell","safe broad spectrum immunoprophylactic strategies capable","B cell dependent mechanisms","lethal doses","mouse pneumovirus","damaging inflammation","enhanced protection","specific antibody production","typical vaccination strategies","extent of pathogen replication","mouse-adapted SARS-coronavirus","significant decreases","resolution","prior development of inducible bronchus","antigen specificities inherent","lymphoid tissue","Mice","CD4","morbidity","functional integrity","need","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","application","protein cage nanoparticle","increased survival","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","presence","BACKGROUND","Destruction"],"language":"en"},

In the rat, \u03B3\u03B4 IELs are reportedly much less common, but technical issues suggest that previous analyses should be interpreted cautiously. The study of IELs in rats has been impeded by isolation procedures that are lengthy and complex, leading to small cell yields. For this reason, it is possible that rat IELs analyzed in previous studies have not been representative of the entire IEL compartment. We report a new method for the isolation of rat IELs that is based on the selective removal of intestinal epithelial cells under conditions that leave the basement membrane undisturbed. The method is rapid and requires neither enzymatic digestion, nor surgical removal of Peyer\u0027s patches, nor vigorous mechanical manipulation of the intestine. The yield of rat IELs using this method is 5- to 10-fold greater than that reported for other methods. Morphological and phenotypic analyses demonstrated that the purified cell population is comprised of IELs and is not contaminated with lamina propria or Peyer\u0027s patch lymphocytes. Phenotypic analysis revealed five major subsets of IELs based on differential cell surface expression of CD4, CD8, and \u03B1\u03B2 T cell receptor (TcR). Among the \u03B1\u03B2TcR\u2212 cells was a population of \u03B3\u03B4 T cells present at levels not previously detected.

For infection, viruses interact with multiple cell surface components, including receptors, activating proteases, and signaling molecules. It appears that Tspans, such as CD151, CD82, CD81, CD63, CD9, Tspan9, and Tspan7, coordinate these associations by concentrating the interacting partners into Tspan platforms. In addition to mediating viral attachment and entry, these platforms may also be involved in intracellular trafficking of internalized viruses and assist in defining virus assembly and exit sites. In conclusion, Tspans play a role in viral infection at different stages of the virus replication cycle.

The interferon-inducible 2\u2032,5-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetases (OAS) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) are components of a potent host antiviral pathway. We previously showed that murine coronavirus (MHV) accessory protein ns2, a 2H phosphoesterase superfamily member, is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates (2-5A) thereby preventing activation of RNase L (Zhao et al., Cell Host and Microbe 11:607\u201316, 2012). The PDE activity of ns2 is required for viral replication in macrophages and for hepatitis. Here, we will demonstrate that group A rotavirus, the primary cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis in children worldwide, encodes an homologous and similar PDE. The VP3 carboxy-terminal domain (VP3-CTD) shares sequence and predicted structural homology with ns2, including two catalytic His-x-Thr/Ser motifs.

In addition, its expression in cells depleted 2-5A levels induced by OAS activation with poly (rI):poly (rC), preventing RNase L activation. In the context of recombinant chimeric MHV expressing inactive ns2, the VP3-CTD restored the ability to replicate efficiently in macrophages or in the livers of infected mice, while chimeras expressing inactive VP3-CTD (H718A or H798R) were attenuated. Also, chimeric viruses expressing active ns2 or VP3, but not mutant ns2 or VP3, were able to protect ribosomal RNA from RNase L-mediated degradation. Thus, VP3-CTD is a 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE able to functionally substitute for ns2 in the context of MHV infection. Remarkably, therefore, two disparate RNA viruses encode proteins with homologous 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDEs that antagonize innate immunity. In addition, based on sequence and predicted structural homology with MHV ns2 and rotavirus VP3, several other viruses have been identified that encode proteins with predicted 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activities.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silverman, Robert H.; Zhang, Rong; Jha, Babal K.; Ogden, Kristen M.; Dong, Beihua; Elliott, Ruth; Zhao, Ling; Patton, John T.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466613005218; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466613005218","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV ns2","rotavirus VP3","inactive VP3-CTD","Recombinant VP3-CTD","PDE activity of ns2","inactive ns2","mutant ns2","PDE able","activation of RNase","similar PDE","PDE activities","accessory protein ns2","VP3 carboxy-terminal domain","context of MHV infection","context of recombinant chimeric MHV","chimeric viruses","OAS activation","structural homology","poly","disparate RNA viruses","macrophages","proteins","innate immunity","addition","viral countermeasures","shares sequence","viral replication","ribosomal RNA","Cell Host","productive virus infection","potent host antiviral pathway","chimeras","H phosphoesterase superfamily member","primary cause of severe","dehydrating gastroenteritis","components","Zhao","livers of infected mice","murine coronavirus","x-Thr","children","phosphodiesterase","levels","rC","H718A","mediated degradation","Ser motifs","cells","Microbe","hepatitis","ribonuclease","PDEs","H798R","ability","expression","synthetases","interferon-inducible","oligoadenylates"],"language":"en"},

The two proteins share the same topological structure and several important sites critical for the antiviral functions in other species are conserved in the goose. Goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 are most closely related to their respective orthologs in ducks; these proteins exhibited high mRNA transcript levels in immune-related tissues, including the thymus, bursa of Fabricius, and Harderian gland, compared to other tissues. Moreover, goose IFITM1 was highly constitutively expressed in gastrointestinal tract tissues, while goose IFITM3 was expressed in respiratory organs. Furthermore, goose IFITM3 was activated in goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with Tembusu virus (TMUV) or treated with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) agonists, while only the R848 and Poly (I:C) agonists induced significant upregulation of goose IFITM1. Furthermore, goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were upregulated in the sampled tissues, to some extent, after TMUV infection. Notably, significant upregulation of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 was detected in the cecum and cecal tonsil, where TMUV was primarily distributed.

We examined the epidemiologic and clinical factors associated with death for all laboratory-confirmed SARS patients in Taiwan. Methods Using initial data in medical records reported by hospitals to the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan, we analyzed whether hematological, biochemical and arterial blood gas measures could predict fatality in 346 SARS patients. Results Both fatalities (n = 73; 21.1%) and survivors had elevated plasma concentration of initial C-reactive protein (CRP), but the mean CRP concentration was higher in fatalities (47.7 \u00B1 43.3 mg/L) than in survivors (24.6 \u00B1 28.2 mg/L). Initial lymphocyte counts were low in both fatalities (814 \u00B1 378/\u03BCL) and survivors (1019 \u00B1 480/\u03BCL). After controlling for age and sex, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that hematological factors significantly associated with fatality included initial neutrophil count \u003E 7000/\u03BCL (odds ratio [OR] = 6.4), initial CRP concentration \u003E 47.5 mg/L (OR = 5.8) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) \u003E 593.5 IU/L (OR = 4.2).

Has China just experienced a herald wave, to use terminology borrowed from those who study tsunamis, and is the big wave still to come? Serosurveys can help answer these questions precisely.3 To serosurvey the outbreak would involve testing sera of blood samples from the most representative sample of the population at the epicentre of the epidemic, Wuhan. Serology analysis with neutralising antibodies from the 1000 people could allow for the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections to be estimated with good accuracy. This rate could be extrapolated to the city\u0027s entire population and thus inform more precisely whether the provisional attack rate during this period was a few cases per thousand or perhaps affected 1\u20132% of the population, 20%, or more. Serosurveys should be seen as polls before elections; they can be repeated several times,3 week after week, to monitor the epidemic precisely.

Treatment of infected mice with neutralizing anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies significantly accelerated lung recovery and improved lung tissue integrity. ANGPTL4-deficient mice also showed reduced lung damage and recovered faster from influenza infection when compared to their wild-type counterparts.

We therefore examined how oxidation affects flavivirus RNA replication. We found that antioxidant treatment reduced virus production, reduced the viral positive-to-negative strand RNA ratio, and resulted in the accumulation of uncapped positive-sense viral RNAs. Treatment of the NS5 RNA capping enzyme in vitro with oxidizing agents enhanced guanylyltransferase activity, indicating that the guanylyltransferase function of the flavivirus NS5 RNA capping enzyme is activated by oxidative conditions. Antioxidant treatment also reduced alphavirus RNA replication and protein expression while enhancing nsP1 capping activity.

The KmR gene was then excised by PstI, which left a 48-bp linker representing the heterologous sequence. The same procedure was followed to introduce a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) corresponding to epitope C from the spike protein S from the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). Nine insertion/deletion mutants (indels) that contained long foreign peptides variously located around the ClpG signal peptide (SP) processing site were characterized. A striking feature of this study is the variety of amino acid (aa) insertions in the ClpG prepilin that have little or no effect on CS31A fimbria biogenesis. These \u2018permissive\u2019 sites tolerate inserts of 18 or 19 aa and accept sequences of different natures in view of their aa composition, charge and hydrophobicity. The results obtained here are also interesting in light of the high level of aa sequence conservation seen in the SP and N-terminal domains of the ClpG-related subunits. The structure-function relationship of the ClpG SP is discussed. The TGEV-C epitope fused to the N-terminal end of the mature ClpG protein was cell-surface exposed, as observed on immuno-electron microscopy.

As the master regulator of the interferon (IFN)-dependent immune response, IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) plays a central role in innate antiviral immunity. To explore the role of bat IRF7 in the regulation of the IFN response, we performed sequence and functional analysis of IRF7 from the pteropid bat, Pteropus alecto. Our results demonstrate that bat IRF7 retains the ability to bind to MyD88 and activate the IFN response despite unique changes in the MyD88 binding domain. We also demonstrate that bat IRF7 has a unique expression pattern across both immune and non-immune related tissues and is inducible by double-strand RNA. The broad tissue distribution of IRF7 may provide bats with an enhanced ability to rapidly activate the IFN response in a wider range of tissues compared to other mammals.

The recent development of PLX5622, a specific inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor that depletes microglia, allows studying the role of microglia in conditions of brain injury such as viral encephalitis, the most common form of brain infection. Here we used this inhibitor in a model of viral infection-induced epilepsy, in which C57BL/6 mice are infected by a picornavirus (Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus) and display seizures and hippocampal damage. Our results show that microglia are required early after infection to limit virus distribution and persistence, most likely by modulating T cell activation. Microglia depletion accelerated the occurrence of seizures, exacerbated hippocampal damage, and led to neurodegeneration in the spinal cord, which is normally not observed in this mouse strain. This study enhances our understanding of the role of microglia in viral encephalitis and adds to the concept of microglia-T cell crosstalk.","publish_time":"2018-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waltl, Inken; K\u00E4ufer, Christopher; Gerhauser, Ingo; Chhatbar, Chintan; Ghita, Luca; Kalinke, Ulrich; L\u00F6scher, Wolfgang","journal":"Brain Behav Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd8bfda4284af708fa290e425b76e5332a5cecb8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111316.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159118303568; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159118303568; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2018.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30217535/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of microglia","concept of microglia","Microglia depletion","T cells","immune cells","viral encephalitis","specific role","common form of brain infection","T cell crosstalk","hippocampal damage","CNS resident myeloid cells","immune response","immune surveillance","model of viral infection-induced epilepsy","modulating T cell activation","conditions of brain injury","specific inhibitor of colony","display seizures","occurrence of seizures","virus distribution","Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus","persistence","picornavirus","factor","blood","interactions","recent development of PLX5622","neurodegeneration","process","central nervous system","C57BL","receptor","infections","monocytes","understanding","spinal cord","mice","study","mouse strain","results"],"language":"en"},

Rapid antigen detection tests and point-of-care mPCR-based assays provide a fast detection of viral pathogens. Nonetheless, the prescription rate of antibiotics for respiratory infections is exceedingly high. In particular, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections frequently cause antibiotic treatment. METHODS: Children hospitalized in our clinic with an acute respiratory infection between January 2008 and January 2013 were included in the present study. Data of 3799 children were analyzed retrospectively for clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and antibiotic and inhalation treatment. We performed an in-house m-RT-PCR-ELISA method for pathogen detection. RESULTS: Pathogen detection was possible in 2464 patients. In 6.3%, hMPV and, in 24.0%, RSV were detected. Patients positively tested for hMPV received inhalation therapy in 62.9%; patients positive for RSV in 73.8%. Patients positive for hMPV were treated with antibiotics in 62.3%. Patients with RSV infection received antibiotic treatment in 44.4%; all others in 43.5%. Notably, a positive result in RSV-RADT was associated with reduced number of antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSION: hMPV infections inherit a two times higher probability of antibiotic treatment. There was no significant difference in laboratory findings or body temperature between hMPV infection and infections caused by other pathogens. Clinical symptoms seem not to differ from those in RSV illness. Nonetheless, RSV infections triggered significantly lower antibiotic prescription rates. A considerate application of a POC-mPCR for patients with RSV-like symptoms and age of 1 year and older with a negative RSV-RADT might lead to higher detection rates of hMPV and a reduction in prescription of antibiotics.","publish_time":"2018-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schreiner, D.; Groendahl, B.; Puppe, W.; Off, H.

Contamination of foods by bacterial pathogens (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella typhimurium) results in human infection. A typical example is the current issue with Coronavirus, which has the potential for foodborne transmission and ruling out such concerns is often difficult. Although, the possible dissemination of such viruses via the food chain has been raised. Standard bacterial detection methods require several hours or even days to obtain the results, and the delay may result in food poisoning to eventuate. Conventional biochemical and microbiological tests are expensive, complex, time-consuming and not always reliable. Therefore, there are urgent demands to develop simple, cheap, quick, sensitive, specific and reliable tests for the detection of these pathogens in foods. Recent advances in smart materials, nanomaterials and biomolecular modeling have been a quantum leap in the development of biosensors in overcoming the limitations of a conventional standard laboratory assay. This research aimed to critically review bacteriophage-based biosensors, used for the detection of foodborne pathogens, as well as their trends, outcomes and challenges are discussed. The future perspective in the use of simple and cheap biosensors is in the development of lab-on-chips, and its availability in every household to test the quality of their food.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aliakbar Ahovan, Zahra; Hashemi, Ali; De Plano, Laura Maria; Gholipourmalekabadi, Mazaher; Seifalian, Alexander","journal":"Nanomaterials (Basel)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32168802/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nano10030501","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of foodborne pathogens","bacterial pathogens","cheap biosensors","development of biosensors","community health","public health","reliable tests","Standard bacterial detection methods","results","foodborne transmission","food poisoning","food chain","health care systems","bacteriophage-based biosensors","microbiological tests","use of simple","conventional standard laboratory assay","main concerns","development of lab","Contamination of foods","Legionella pneumophila","Escherichia coli","Salmonella typhimurium","Campylobacter jejuni","smart materials","nanomaterials","biomolecular modeling","Streptococci","Staphylococcus aureus","limitations","complex","quantum leap","hours","serious impact","current issue","Coronavirus","Recent advances","human infection","viruses","typical example","chips","future perspective","days","potential","trends","urgent demands","delay","possible dissemination","household","availability","outcomes","challenges","quality","research"],"language":"en"},

During the early stages of epidemics, analysis of \u2018line lists\u2019 with detailed information on laboratory-confirmed cases can provide important insights into the epidemiology of a specific disease. The objective of the present study was to investigate the extent to which reliable epidemiologic inferences could be made from publicly-available epidemiologic data of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus. METHODS: We collated and compared six different line lists of laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in the 2013 outbreak in China, including the official line list constructed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention plus five other line lists by HealthMap, Virginia Tech, Bloomberg News, the University of Hong Kong and FluTrackers, based on publicly-available information. We characterized clinical severity and transmissibility of the outbreak, using line lists available at specific dates to estimate epidemiologic parameters, to replicate real-time inferences on the hospitalization fatality risk, and the impact of live poultry market closure. RESULTS: Demographic information was mostly complete (less than 10% missing for all variables) in different line lists, but there were more missing data on dates of hospitalization, discharge and health status (more than 10% missing for each variable). The estimated onset to hospitalization distributions were similar (median ranged from 4.6 to 5.6 days) for all line lists. Hospital fatality risk was consistently around 20% in the early phase of the epidemic for all line lists and approached the final estimate of 35% afterwards for the official line list only. Most of the line lists estimated \u003E90% reduction in incidence rates after live poultry market closures in Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that analysis of publicly-available data on H7N9 permitted reliable assessment of transmissibility and geographical dispersion, while assessment of clinical severity was less straightforward. Our results highlight the potential value in constructing a minimum dataset with standardized format and definition, and regular updates of patient status. Such an approach could be particularly useful for diseases that spread across multiple countries.","publish_time":"2014-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Eric HY; Zheng, Jiandong; Tsang, Tim K; Liao, Qiaohong; Lewis, Bryan; Brownstein, John S; Sanders, Sharon; Wong, Jessica Y; Mekaru, Sumiko R; Rivers, Caitlin; Wu, Peng; Jiang, Hui; Li, Yu; Yu, Jianxing; Zhang, Qian; Chang, Zhaorui; Liu, Fengfeng; Peng, Zhibin; Leung, Gabriel M; Feng, Luzhao; Cowling, Benjamin J; Yu, Hongjie","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea3edffefb5fa20412b31e223330af336503afaf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4066833.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885692/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-12-88","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Nanjing","Hangzhou"],"keyphrases":["line lists\u2019","different line lists of laboratory","official line list","available data","available information","missing data","available epidemiologic data of human infection","H7N9","timely reliable data","reliable epidemiologic inferences","dates of hospitalization","appropriate analysis","specific disease","reliable assessment of transmissibility","hospitalization fatality risk","best-available evidence","human cases of influenza","hospitalization distributions","epidemiologic parameters","assessment of clinical severity","Disease Control","outbreak","specific dates","health status","virus infection","detailed information","Demographic information","RESULTS","poultry market closures","infectious disease threats","Hospital fatality risk","impact of live poultry market closure","Appropriate public health responses","real-time inferences","estimated onset","early phase","final estimate","early stages of epidemics","regular updates of patient status","definition","Bloomberg News","Virginia Tech","Chinese Center","geographical dispersion","minimum dataset","HealthMap","Prevention","standardized format","University of Hong Kong","Shanghai","Nanjing","incidence rates","extent","reduction","discharge","China","diseases","potential value","median","important insights","BACKGROUND","FluTrackers","epidemiology","present study","Hangzhou","days","variables","multiple countries","objective","approach","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The interaction of viral proteins with host proteins plays an important role in infection and pathogenesis, often bypassing traditional host defenses such as the interferon response and apoptosis. Host\u2013viral protein interactions can be studied using a variety of proteomic approaches ranging from genetic and biochemical to large scale high throughput technologies. Protein interactions between host and viral proteins are greatly influenced by host signal transduction pathways. In this review, we will focus on comparing proteomic information obtained through differing technologies and how their integration can be used to determine the functional aspect of the host response to infection. We will briefly review and evaluate techniques employed to elucidate viral\u2013host interactions with a primary focus on Protein Microarrays (PMA) and Mass Spectrometry (MS) as potential tools in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. As many potential molecular markers and targets are proteins, proteomic profiling is expected to yield both clearer and more direct answers to functional and pharmacologic questions.","publish_time":"2014-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amaya, Moushimi; Baer, Alan; Voss, Kelsey; Campbell, Catherine; Mueller, Claudius; Bailey, Charles; Kehn Hall, Kylene; Petricoin, Emanuel; Narayanan, Aarthi","journal":"Pathog Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6514e47c856d0fd2052e0348da3735b9d3428503.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1fb6d39474330339cd7f073e0719d9ef0d6cad33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108530.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488789/; https://doi.org/10.1111/2049-632x.12150","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host proteins","host interactions","host response","host cell machinery","traditional host defenses","viral protein interactions","interaction of viral proteins","host signal transduction pathways","Protein Microarrays","infection","proteomic profiling","proteomic information","review","variety of proteomic approaches","potential tools","differing technologies","interferon response","primary focus","functional aspect","potential molecular markers","discovery of novel therapeutic targets","large scale high throughput technologies","PMA","Mass Spectrometry","pathogenesis","elegant strategies","important role","direct answers","MS","productive infectious cycle","pharmacologic questions","Viruses","integration","apoptosis","techniques"],"language":"en"},

In most studies, viral loads (VL) were evaluated in hospitalized children and at a single time-point. We investigated the relationship between VLs and disease severity in both outpatients and inpatients with RSV infection. METHODS: We enrolled previously healthy children with RSV infection. Disease severity was defined by level of care (outpatients vs ward vs pediatric intensive care unit [PICU]), and a clinical disease severity score (CDSS). Nasopharyngeal VLs by polymerase chain reaction and CDSS were measured at enrollment and daily in inpatients. VL decay according to disease severity was analyzed using linear mixed modeling. RESULTS: From February 2015 to March 2017, we enrolled 150 infants: 39 outpatients and 111 inpatients. VLs were higher in outpatients than in age-matched inpatients. Among inpatients, initial VLs were comparable in ward and PICU patients, and preceded the peak CDSS. However, after excluding infants treated with steroids, those hospitalized in the ward had higher VLs than infants requiring PICU care (P \u003C .001). Dynamic analyses showed that VL decay was delayed in PICU patients, especially in those treated with steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Higher VLs at presentation and a faster and consistent VL decline were both associated with less severe RSV disease in children. SUMMARY: Infants with less severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease had higher viral loads (VL) at presentation, and faster and consistent VL decline. Conversely, VL decay and overall viral exposure were prolonged and higher in infants severe RSV disease receiving steroids.","publish_time":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia-Mauri\u00F1o, Cristina; Moore-Clingenpeel, Melissa; Thomas, Jessica; Mertz, Sara; Cohen, Daniel M; Ramilo, Octavio; Mejias, Asuncion","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a76b38e924387b89e7e80a3aa1df2bd116edbde2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6452299.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30418604/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","CDSS","PICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["higher VLs","infants severe RSV disease","VL decay","RSV infection","higher viral loads","consistent VL decline","PICU care","clinical disease severity score","Nasopharyngeal VLs","initial VLs","PICU patients","hospitalized children","steroids","healthy children","severe respiratory syncytial virus","age-matched inpatients","outpatients vs ward vs pediatric intensive care unit","level of care","presentation","viral exposure","peak CDSS","clinical outcomes","polymerase chain reaction","association","linear mixed modeling","single time-point","BACKGROUND","enrollment","Dynamic analyses","SUMMARY","studies","CONCLUSIONS","relationship","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we describe a challenge experiment with the same recombinant FCoVs in order to gain data on the in vivo characteristics on these viruses. While parent virus FIPV DF-2 developed feline infectious peritonitis in all the infected cats, its recombinant virus PBFIPV-DF-2, differing only in seven nucleotides, proved to be surprisingly low virulent, although caused an acute febrile episode similarly to the original FIPV DF-2. PBFIPV-DF-2 infection induced significantly lower virus neutralization titers than its parent virus, and lacked the second phase of viremia and development of fatal course of the disease. The recombinant PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i with completed ORF3abc gained biological properties that differentiate between the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIPV biotypes such as intensive replication in the gut, absence of viremia and weak or no serological response.

This study (1) examines factors that influence when individuals transition from a negative to positive test (acquisition) or a positive to negative test (loss) of rhinovirus (HRV) and other respiratory tract viruses in 26 households followed weekly for one year, (2) investigates evidence for intrahousehold and interhousehold transmission and the characteristics of individuals implicated in transmission, and (3) builds data-based simulation models to identify factors that most strongly affect patterns of prevalence. METHODS: We detected HRV, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, influenza and bocavirus with the FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC). We used logistic regression to find covariates affecting acquisition or loss of HRV including demographic characteristics of individuals, their household, their current infection status, and prevalence within their household and across the population. We apply generalized linear mixed models to test robustness of results. RESULTS: Acquisition of HRV was less probable in older individuals and those infected with a coronavirus, and higher with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Loss of HRV is reduced with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Within households, only children and symptomatic individuals show evidence for transmission, while between households only a higher number of infected older children (ages 5-19) increases the probability of acquisition. Coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and bocavirus also show evidence of intrahousehold transmission. Simulations show that age-dependent susceptibility and transmission have the largest effects on mean HRV prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Children are most likely to acquire and most likely to transmit HRV both within and between households, with infectiousness concentrated in symptomatic children. Simulations predict that the spread of HRV and other respiratory tract viruses can be reduced but not eliminated by practices within the home.","publish_time":"2018-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adler, Frederick R.; Stockmann, Chris; Ampofo, Krow; Pavia, Andrew T.; Byington, Carrie L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6059387.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30044794/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199388","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BioFire Diagnostics","HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Acquisition of HRV","loss of HRV","spread of HRV","mean HRV prevalence","households","evidence of intrahousehold transmission","older individuals","symptomatic individuals","interhousehold transmission","individuals transition","higher proportion","higher number of infected older children","household members","symptomatic children","demographic characteristics of individuals","key loci of transmission","negative test","positive test","probability of acquisition","respiratory tract viruses","bocavirus","factors","patterns of prevalence","Simulations","Common cold viruses","robustness of results","generalized linear mixed models","data-based simulation models","platform","PCR","FilmArray polymerase chain reaction","financial burdens","significant health","largest effects","influenza","age-dependent susceptibility","covariates","rhinovirus","BioFire Diagnostics","current infection status","BACKGROUND","ages","LLC","logistic regression","paramyxoviruses","year","infectiousness","control strategies","Coronaviruses","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","practices","home","study","population"],"language":"en"},

Although a number of promising potential vaccines and therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV have been described, no effective antiviral drug against SARS-CoV is currently available. The intricate, sequential nature of the viral entry process provides multiple valid targets for drug development. Here, we describe a rapid and safe cell-based high-throughput screening system, Dual Envelope Pseudovirion (DEP) Assay, for specifically screening inhibitors of viral entry. The assay system employs a novel dual envelope strategy, using lentiviral pseudovirions as targets whose entry is driven by the SARS-CoV Spike glycoprotein. A second, unrelated viral envelope is used as an internal control to reduce the number of false positives. As an example of the power of this assay a class of inhibitors is reported with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV at two steps of the replication cycle, viral entry and particle assembly. This assay system can be easily adapted to screen entry inhibitors against other viruses with the careful selection of matching partner virus envelopes.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yanchen; Agudelo, Juliet; Lu, Kai; Goetz, David H.; Hansell, Elizabeth; Chen, Yen Ting; Roush, William R.; McKerrow, James; Craik, Charles S.; Amberg, Sean M.; Simmons, Graham","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f402931a00ab4f625c657136f3ee4350d7a8288.json; document_parses/pdf_json/28ee77d84e0753d32bbb58190d2d9e76f8856a30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3205982.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21820471/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211003871; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.07.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211003871","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Dual Envelope Pseudovirion"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry inhibitors","screening inhibitors of viral entry","assay system","viral entry process","SARS-CoV Spike glycoprotein","unrelated viral envelope","Dual Envelope Pseudovirion","class of inhibitors","novel dual envelope strategy","high-throughput screening system","number of promising potential vaccines","drug development","multiple valid targets","effective antiviral drug","number of false positives","endemic atypical pneumonia","therapeutic agents","Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","replication cycle","DEP","careful selection of matching partner virus envelopes","lentiviral pseudovirions","causal agent","viruses","sequential nature","steps","infecting thousands of people","safe cell","particle assembly","internal control","power","example"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, there is an urgent need to build multidisciplinary and multi-institutional teams to combat this important biodefense agent.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"DiCaprio, Erin; Ma, Yuanmei; Hughes, John; Li, Jianrong","journal":"Infectious Disease Clinics of North America","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3060236a6c6bfdb9423965495946261f00642b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126578.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891552013000482; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891552013000482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24011835/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idc.2013.05.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tremendous research efforts","Future research efforts","Human norovirus","multi-institutional teams","robust animal model","efficient cell culture system","novel sanitizers","number","sensitive detection methods","important biodefense agent","control interventions","urgent need","vaccines","cause of foodborne illness","effective measure","antiviral drugs","environment"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel open reading frame (ORF4) encoded by the murine norovirus (MNV) subgenomic RNA, in an alternative reading frame overlapping the VP1 coding region. ORF4 is translated during virus infection and the resultant protein localizes predominantly to the mitochondria. Using reverse genetics we demonstrated that expression of ORF4 is not required for virus replication in tissue culture but its loss results in a fitness cost since viruses lacking the ability to express ORF4 restore expression upon repeated passage in tissue culture. Functional analysis indicated that the protein produced from ORF4 antagonizes the innate immune response to infection by delaying the upregulation of a number of cellular genes activated by the innate pathway, including IFN-Beta. Apoptosis in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was also increased during virus infection in the absence of ORF4 expression. In vivo analysis of the WT and mutant virus lacking the ability to express ORF4 demonstrated an important role for ORF4 expression in infection and virulence. STAT1-/- mice infected with a virus lacking the ability to express ORF4 showed a delay in the onset of clinical signs when compared to mice infected with WT virus. Quantitative PCR and histopathological analysis of samples from these infected mice demonstrated that infection with a virus not expressing ORF4 results in a delayed infection in this system. In light of these findings we propose the name virulence factor 1, VF1 for this protein. The identification of VF1 represents the first characterization of an alternative open reading frame protein for the calicivirus family. The immune regulatory function of the MNV VF1 protein provide important perspectives for future research into norovirus biology and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2011-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"McFadden, Nora; Bailey, Dalan; Carrara, Guia; Benson, Alicia; Chaudhry, Yasmin; Shortland, Amita; Heeney, Jonathan; Yarovinsky, Felix; Simmonds, Peter; Macdonald, Andrew; Goodfellow, Ian","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58d91841094c91e8269b22337c66dfa16e04b965.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3234229.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22174679/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002413","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Quantitative PCR","MNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of ORF4","virus infection","ORF4 results","absence of ORF4 expression","WT virus","virus replication","mutant virus","delayed infection","MNV VF1 protein","alternative open reading frame protein","resultant protein","ability","infected mice","alternative reading frame","identification of VF1","novel open reading frame","characterization","tissue culture","Functional analysis","innate immune response","histopathological analysis of samples","Small RNA viruses","important perspectives","important role","norovirus biology","murine norovirus","subgenomic RNA","loss results","innate pathway","virulence factor","immune regulatory function","future research","upregulation","fitness cost","repeated passage","VP1 coding region","number of cellular genes","calicivirus family","macrophage cell line","RAW264","pathogenesis","Quantitative PCR","mechanisms","onset of clinical signs","capacity","findings","IFN-Beta","reverse genetics","short genomes","Apoptosis","mitochondria","system","light","STAT1"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to identify the association between multiple respiratory viral infections and PICU admission among infants with bronchiolitis. Methods We performed a 1:1 case-control study enrolling previously healthy full-term infants (\u226412 months) with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU as cases and those to the general pediatric ward as controls from 2015 to 2017. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of the respiratory viruses. We summarized the characteristics of infants admitted to the PICU and the general pediatric unit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to fit the association between multiple respiratory viral infections (\u22652 strains) and PICU admission. Results A total of 135 infants admitted to the PICU were compared with 135 randomly selected control infants admitted to the general pediatric unit. The PICU patients were younger (median: 2.2 months, interquartile range: 1.3\u20134.2) than the general ward patients (median: 3.2 months, interquartile range: 1.6\u20136.4). Respiratory syncytial virus (74.1%), rhinovirus (28.9%), and coronavirus (5.9%) were the most common viruses for bronchiolitis requiring PICU admission. Patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU tended to have multiple viral infections compared with patients on the general ward (23.0% vs. 10.4%, P \u003C0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, bronchiolitis with multiple viral infections was associated with higher odds of PICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.17\u20135.57, P =0.02).

In this study airflow patterns across the isolation room doorway induced by the operation of single hinged and sliding doors with simulated human passage were examined.

Tracer gas measurements showed that the examined ventilation rates (6 and 12 air changes per hour) had only a small effect on the air volume exchange across the doorway with the hinged door. The results were more variable with the sliding door. Supply-exhaust flow rate differential reduced the door motion-induced air transfer significantly with both door types. The experiments showed that the passage induced substantial air volume transport through the doorway with both door types. However, overall, the sliding door performed better in all tested scenarios, because the door-opening motion itself generated relatively smaller air volume exchange across the doorway, and hence should be the preferred choice in the design of isolation rooms.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalliom\u00E4ki, Petri; Saarinen, Pekka; Tang, Julian W.; Koskela, Hannu","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115809.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132316302633; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.07.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132316302633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287966/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sliding door","hinged door","door types","door motion-induced air transfer","air changes","isolation room doorway","smaller air volume exchange","substantial air volume transport","pathogen laden air","design of isolation rooms","operation of single hinged","simulated human passage","healthcare worker passage","Abstract Negative pressure isolation rooms","greater flow","airborne diseases","contagious diseases","examined ventilation rates","Supply-exhaust flow rate differential","doors","risk","small effect","study airflow patterns","Tracer gas measurements","emitted pathogens","hour","patients","cross-infection","preferred choice","tested scenarios","hospitals","Smoke visualizations","experiments","results","Airflows"],"language":"en"},

However, the role in HIV-1 replication of the third major component, the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), has remained largely unknown. In this study, we show that the DUB-inhibitors (DIs) P22077 and PR-619, specific for the DUBs USP7 and USP47, impair Gag processing and thereby reduce the infectivity of released virions without affecting viral protease activity. Furthermore, the replication capacity of X4- and R5-tropic HIV-1(NL4-3) in human lymphatic tissue is decreased upon treatment with these inhibitors without affecting cell viability. Most strikingly, combinatory treatment with DIs and proteasome inhibitors synergistically blocks virus replication at concentrations where mono-treatment was ineffective, indicating that DIs can boost the therapeutic effect of proteasome inhibitors. In addition, P22077 and PR-619 increase the polyubiquitination of Gag and thus its entry into the UPS and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I pathway. In summary, our data point towards a model in which specific inhibitors of DUBs not only interfere with virus spread but also increase the immune recognition of HIV-1 expressing cells.","publish_time":"2017-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Setz, Christian; Friedrich, Melanie; Rauch, Pia; Fraedrich, Kirsten; Matthaei, Alina; Traxdorf, Maximilian; Schubert, Ulrich","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/826307b42adef6c0aa282ada8ec07afb1b35cb3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5580479.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v9080222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28805676/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus replication","specific inhibitors of DUBs","DIs","DUB-inhibitors","therapeutic effect of proteasome inhibitors","proteasome holoenzymes","ubiquitin proteasome system","major component","mono-treatment","UPS","combinatory treatment","DUBs USP7","replication capacity of X4","R5-tropic HIV","P22077","immune recognition of HIV","immunogenicity of human immunodeficiency virus type","major constituent parts","major histocompatibility complex","Gag processing","crucial role","polyubiquitination of Gag","number of ubiquitin ligases","human lymphatic tissue","concentrations","infectivity of released virions","USP47","model","regulation","viral protease activity","MHC","NL4","deubiquitinating enzymes","entry","data point","cell viability","summary","recent years","pathway","cells","addition","study"],"language":"en"},

The assay accurately detected CSFV RNA from a diverse panel of 33 CSFV strains representing all three genotypes plus an additional in vitro\u2010transcribed RNA from cloned sequences representing a vaccine strain. No cross\u2010reactivity was observed with a panel of 18 viruses associated with livestock including eight other pestivirus strains (bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 1 and type 2, border disease virus, HoBi atypical pestivirus), African swine fever virus, swine vesicular disease virus, swine influenza virus, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, porcine circovirus 1, porcine circovirus 2, porcine respiratory coronavirus, vesicular exanthema of swine virus, bovine herpes virus type 1 and vesicular stomatitis virus. The iiRT\u2010PCR assay accurately detected CSFV as early as 2 days post\u2010inoculation in RNA extracted from serum samples of experimentally infected pigs, before appearance of clinical signs. The limit of detection (LOD (95%)) calculated by probit regression analysis was 23 copies per reaction. The assay has a sample to answer turnaround time of less than an hour using extracted RNA or diluted or low volume of neat serum. The user\u2010friendly, compact device that automatically analyses and displays results could potentially be a useful tool for surveillance and monitoring of CSF in a disease outbreak.","publish_time":"2015-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lung, O.; Pasick, J.; Fisher, M.; Buchanan, C.; Erickson, A.; Ambagala, A.","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b56a4ce3ef991188ecd2f1036fb3d49daa72e6c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169785.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.12318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25644051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSF","Nucleic Acid Analyzer"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["swine vesicular disease virus","swine influenza virus","border disease virus","vesicular exanthema of swine virus","African swine fever virus","vesicular stomatitis virus","rapid detection of classical swine fever virus","reproductive syndrome virus","bovine herpes virus type","swine industry","disease surveillance","disease outbreak","PCR assay","bovine viral diarrhoea virus type","detected CSFV RNA","porcine circovirus","CSFV strains","listed disease","extracted RNA","monitoring of CSF","transcribed RNA","user\u2010friendly device","porcine respiratory coronavirus","pestivirus strains","CSF diagnosis","iiRT","outbreak monitoring","compact device","useful tool","diverse panel","serum samples","limit of detection","insulated isothermal reverse transcriptase PCR","HoBi atypical pestivirus","rapid diagnostic tests","low volume of neat serum","low\u2010cost field","deployable instruments","POCKIT","new probe","infected pigs","cloned sequences","days post\u2010inoculation","severe impact","copies","hour","genotypes","livestock","OIE","probit regression analysis","appearance of clinical signs","Nucleic Acid Analyzer","turnaround time","vaccine strain","reaction","validation","results","data interpretation","reactivity","LOD","viruses","cross","study"],"language":"en"},

We demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a transcutaneous vaccine formulation using a hydrogel patch in animal experiments. In the present study, we performed a clinical study to apply our TCI formulation for vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria in human. The TCI device was a hydrogel patch (antigen-free) applied to the left brachial medial skin of 22 healthy volunteers for 48h. Next, the hydrogel patch, containing 2mg tetanus toxoid (TT) and 2mg diphtheria toxoid (DT) as the TCI formulation, was applied to 27 healthy volunteers for 24h and some volunteers were vaccinated again by TCI formulation. For safety assessment, the patch application site was observed to assess local adverse events, and systemic adverse events were determined by a blood test. The antigen-free hydrogel patch and TCI formulation containing TT and DT did not induce local or systemic severe adverse events. For vaccine efficacy estimation, toxoid-specific serum antibody titers were determined by ELISA and the toxin-neutralizing activity of the induced antibody was evaluated in a passive-challenge experiment. The anti-TT IgG titer and the anti-DT IgG titer increased, and a significant effect was detected by paired t-test. The antibody titers were maintained at higher level than that before vaccination for at least 1 year. Moreover, toxoid-specific antibodies were produced by the second vaccination in some subjects. Antibodies induced by application of the TCI formulation neutralized the toxin and prevented toxic death in mice. In addition, changes in the skin condition due to application of the TCI formulation were observed under in vivo confocal Raman spectroscopy. The amount of water and patch components in the stratum corneum increased after application of the TCI formulation, suggesting that the change in the skin condition was related to antigen penetration. These data indicate that this easy-to-use TCI system induces an immune response without severe adverse reactions in humans. This easy-to-use and safe TCI formulation enables mass treatment in an outbreak setting and increased vaccination rates in developing countries, and will greatly contribute to worldwide countermeasures against infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2012-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hirobe, Sachiko; Matsuo, Kazuhiko; Quan, Ying-Shu; Kamiyama, Fumio; Morito, Hironori; Asada, Hideo; Takaya, Yusuke; Mukai, Yohei; Okada, Naoki; Nakagawa, Shinsaku","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2d51fee1e73856e4c891437f8349da3eadbe363.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126733.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11020913; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11020913; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22230592/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.12.130","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safe TCI formulation","TCI device","easy-to-use TCI system","transcutaneous vaccine formulation","antigen-free hydrogel patch","patch application site","patch components","local adverse events","systemic adverse events","tetanus toxoid","easy-to-use vaccination method","diphtheria toxoid","increased vaccination rates","systemic severe adverse events","toxoid-specific antibodies","skin condition","healthy volunteers","induced antibody","toxoid-specific serum antibody titers","severe adverse reactions","anti-TT IgG titer","anti-DT IgG titer","toxin","antigen penetration","vaccine efficacy estimation","left brachial medial skin","clinical study","safety assessment","present study","blood test","Abstract Transcutaneous immunization","paired t-test","immune response","outbreak","mass treatment","ELISA","stratum corneum","significant effect","humans","activity","developing countries","higher level","toxic death","animal experiments","worldwide countermeasures","infectious diseases","mice","water","addition","changes","confocal Raman spectroscopy","data","passive-challenge experiment","year","subjects"],"language":"en"},

The study compared effects of the three models through exploring patient experience in TB diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We selected two sites in each model of TB service in four provinces of China. In each site, 50 patients were selected from TB patient registries for a structured questionnaire survey, with a total of 293 patients recruited. All participants were newly registered uncomplicated TB cases without any major complications or resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs, and having successfully completed treatment. Diagnostic and treatment procedures were reviewed from medical charts of the surveyed patients to compare with national guidelines. RESULTS: Specialist sites had the highest patient expenditure, hospitalization rates and mostly used second-line anti-TB drugs, while the integrated model reported the opposite. The median health expenditure was USD 1,499 for the specialist sites and USD 306 for the integrated sites, with 83% and 15% patients respectively having unnecessary hospitalization. 74% of the specialist sites and 19% of the integrated sites used second-line anti-TB drugs. Mixed results were identified in the two dispensary sites. One site had median health expenditure of USD 138 with 12% of patients hospitalized, while the other had USD 912 and 65% respectively. CONCLUSION: The study observed prohibitive financial expenditure and a high level of deviation from national guidelines in all sites, which may be related to the profit-seeking behavior of public hospitals.

RESULTS: Viral or atypical bacterial pathogens were detected in 29.1% of BAL fluid specimens. Coronaviruses were most prevalent (13.4%), followed by rhinoviruses (5.2%), RSV (4.5%) and bocaviruses (3.7%). Comparing the total number of viruses detected, a statistically significant difference was observed between the control group and patients with haematological malignancies (27.5% vs. 57.1%, p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study highlights the high prevalence of respiratory viruses in BAL fluid specimens from adult patients with lower respiratory tract disease. The methods to be used should be sensitive and cover a wide range of potential pathogens. The specific patient population can also influence the detection rates of respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2014-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drieghe, Stefanie; Ryckaert, Inge; Beuselinck, Kurt; Lagrou, Katrien; Padalko, Elizaveta","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2e53d0fa7f133152cb9a310420f68ccb1ed4483.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172540.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447853/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653213005398; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653213005398; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2013.12.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemiology of respiratory viruses","respiratory infections","high prevalence of respiratory viruses","detection rates of respiratory viruses","different viruses","control patients","BAL fluid specimens","lower respiratory tract disease","adult patients","immunocompetent patients","total number of viruses","study population","immunocompromised adults","atypical bacterial pathogens","new commercial multiplex real-time PCR FTD Respiratory","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","haematological malignancies","STUDY DESIGN","CONCLUSION","control group","different groups","wide range of potential pathogens","specific patient population","solid organ transplant recipients","RESULTS","significant difference","severe complications","fungi","BACKGROUND","RSV","studies","children","Coronaviruses","rhinoviruses","bocaviruses","methods","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Methods We conducted a longitudinal serological follow-up study in patients who were hospitalized with A(H7N9) virus infection, during 2013\u20132018. A(H7N9) virus-specific antibody responses were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralization (NT) assays. A random intercept model was used to fit a curve to HAI antibody responses over time. HAI antibody responses were compared by clinical severity. Results Of 67 patients with A(H7N9) virus infection, HAI antibody titers reached 40 on average 11 days after illness onset and peaked at a titer of 290 after three months, and average titers of \u226580 and \u226540 were present until 11 months and 22 months respectively. HAI antibody responses were significantly higher in patients who experienced severe disease, including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, compared with patients who experienced less severe illness. Conclusions Patients with A(H7N9) virus infection who survived severe disease mounted higher antibody responses that persisted for longer periods compared with those that experienced moderate disease. Studies of convalescent plasma treatment for A(H7N9) patients should consider collection of donor plasma from survivors of severe disease between 1 and 11 months after illness onset.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Junbo; Zhu, Huachen; Horby, Peter W.; Wang, Qianli; Zhou, Jiaxin; Jiang, Hui; Liu, Liwei; Zhang, Tianchen; Zhang, Yongli; Chen, Xinhua; Deng, Xiaowei; Nikolay, Birgit; Wang, Wei; Cauchemez, Simon; Guan, Yi; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Yu, Hongjie","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3941684dde530d6a7aa3d2c08e101dc663bd803a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112568.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320300256; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2019.11.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320300256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31954742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HAI antibody responses","H7N9","higher antibody responses","virus-specific antibody responses","HAI antibody titers","virus infection","Conclusions Patients","months","long-term dynamics of antibody responses","severe illness","survivors of severe disease","moderate disease","illness onset","average titers","respiratory failure","collection of donor plasma","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Studies of convalescent plasma treatment","influenza","hemagglutination inhibition","neutralization","curve","longitudinal serological follow-up study","Abstract Objectives","days","longer periods","time","clinical severity","Methods","random intercept model","assays","Results"],"language":"en"},

Statements intended to create awareness and convey the seriousness of infectious disease threats can draw accusations of scare-mongering, while officials can be accused of complacency if such statements are not made. In these communication contexts, news journalists, often reliant on official sources to understand issues are pivotal in selecting and emphasising aspects of official discourse deemed sufficiently newsworthy to present to the public. This paper presents a case-study of news communication regarding the emergence of pH1N1. METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of all television news items about pH1N1. We examined news and current affairs items broadcast on 5 free-to-air Sydney television channels between April 25 2009 (the first report) and October 9 (prior to the vaccine release) for statements about [1] the seriousness of the disease [2] how the public could minimise contagion [3] government responses to emerging information. RESULTS: pH1N1 was the leading health story for eight of 24 weeks and was in the top 5 for 20 weeks. 353 news items were identified, yielding 3086 statements for analysis, with 63.4% related to the seriousness of the situation, 12.9% providing advice for viewers and 23.6% involving assurances from government. Coverage focused on infection/mortality rates, the spread of the virus, the need for public calm, the vulnerability of particular groups, direct and indirect advice for viewers, and government reassurances about effective management. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the reporting of 2009 pH1N1 in Sydney, Australia was generally non-alarmist, while conveying that pH1N1 was potentially serious. Daily infection rate tallies and commentary on changes in the pandemic alert level were seldom contextualised to assist viewers in understanding personal relevance. Suggestions are made about how future reporting of emerging infectious diseases could be enhanced.","publish_time":"2011-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fogarty, Andrea S; Holland, Kate; Imison, Michelle; Blood, R Warwick; Chapman, Simon; Holding, Simon","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/408e677725167e4c45863aab7d91de0a5dae6d22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3079644.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21435263/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sydney","Australia"],"keyphrases":["Statements","news communication","emergence of pH1N1","television news items","news journalists","viewers","public calm","seriousness of infectious disease threats","future reporting of emerging infectious diseases","emerging infectious diseases of unknown severity","government reassurances","Health officials","government responses","emerging information","weeks","current affairs items","particular challenges","official sources","indirect advice","air Sydney television channels","communication contexts","content analysis","vulnerability of particular groups","leading health story","pandemic alert level","emphasising aspects of official discourse","Daily infection rate tallies","commentary","changes","spread","issues","virus","need","accusations of scare","mortality rates","case-study","BACKGROUND","swine","flu","Australia","non-alarmist","effective management","Coverage","mongering","RESULTS","contagion","awareness","paper","METHODS","Suggestions","personal relevance","vaccine release","situation","complacency","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

While anti-viral approaches and vaccines are being considered immediate countermeasures are unavailable. The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature. This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Both conditions have significant similarities that portend pathophysiologic trajectories. Following this potential treatment options emerge. Both COVID-19 and HAPE exhibit a decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen with concomitant hypoxia and tachypnea. There also appears to be a tendency for low carbon dioxide levels in both as well. Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities are present in up to 86% of patients with COVID-19 in addition to patchy infiltrates. Patients with HAPE also exhibit patchy infiltrates throughout the pulmonary fields, often in an asymmetric pattern and CT findings reveal increased lung markings and ground glass-like changes as well. Widespread ground-glass opacities are most commonly a manifestation of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Similarly, elevated fibrinogen levels in both conditions are likely an epiphenomenon of edema formation rather than coagulation activation. Autopsy results of a COVID-19 fatality revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage associated with pulmonary edema, pro-inflammatory concentrates, and indications of early-phase acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). HAPE itself is initially caused by an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and induces altered alveolar-capillary permeability via high pulmonary artery hydrostatic pressures that lead to a protein-rich and mildly hemorrhagic edema. It appears that COVID-19 and HAPE both discretely converge on ARDS. In light of this, a countermeasure that has been shown to be effective in the analogous condition of HAPE is Acetazolamide. Acetazolamide has a myriad of effects on different organ systems, potently reduces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, improves minute ventilation and expired vital capacity. Other therapeutics to consider that are also directed towards decreased pulmonary pressure include Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors. This review describes COVID-19 in parallel to HAPE. Deranged respiratory parameters that are present in both conditions are highlighted. The utilization of medications found to be effective in HAPE, for the treatment of COVID-19, is proposed. Given the medical emergency of a growing contagion and the thousands of lives at stake, expedient attempts to improve survival are needed. Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be potential countermeasures.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Solaimanzadeh, Isaac","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef6f1dea64a581ce9f21fc860d2eea0042e1d921.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096066.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226695/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAPE","CT","ARDS","Nifedipine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary pressure","treatment of COVID","pathophysiology of COVID","pulmonary fields","pulmonary capillary pressure","manifestation of hydrostatic pulmonary edema","hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction","respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema","analogous condition of HAPE","hemorrhagic edema","conditions","Acetazolamide","high pulmonary artery hydrostatic pressures","epiphenomenon of edema formation","Widespread ground-glass opacities","Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities","Phosphodiesterase inhibitors","context","Nifedipine","patchy infiltrates","Effective treatments","potential countermeasures","ARDS","article","patients","decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure","Deranged respiratory parameters","available clinical data","potential treatment options","altered alveolar-capillary permeability","CT findings","immediate countermeasures","phase acute respiratory distress syndrome","fractional inspired oxygen","elevated fibrinogen levels","bilateral diffuse alveolar damage","low carbon dioxide levels","indications of early","increased lung markings","minute ventilation","different organ systems","asymmetric pattern","fatality","pro-inflammatory concentrates","thousands of lives","concomitant hypoxia","growing contagion","stake","vaccines","myriad of effects","expedient attempts","expired vital capacity","tendency","tachypnea","significant similarities","protein-rich","Coronavirus Disease","addition","pathophysiologic trajectories","coagulation activation","anti-viral approaches","medical emergency","survival","literature","changes","perspective","Autopsy results","utilization of medications","review","light","aim","outbreak","therapeutics"],"language":"en"},

This study evaluated plasma proteomic profiling via an N-terminal isotope tagging strategy coupled with liquid chromatography/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry measurement to detect liver fibrosis staging. Pooled plasma from different liver fibrosis stages, which were assessed in advance by the current gold-standard of liver biopsy, was quantitatively analyzed. A total of 72 plasma proteins were found to be dysregulated during the fibrogenesis process, and this finding constituted a valuable candidate plasma biomarker bank for follow-up analysis. Validation results of fibronectin by Western blotting reconfirmed the mass-based data. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis showed four types of metabolic networks for the functional effect of liver fibrosis disease in chronic hepatitis B patients. Consequently, quantitative proteomics via the N-terminal acetyl isotope labeling technique provides an effective and useful tool for screening plasma candidate biomarkers for liver fibrosis. We quantitatively monitored the fibrogenesis process in CHB patients. We discovered many new valuable candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and also partly identified the mechanism involved in liver fibrosis disease. These results provide a clearer understanding of liver fibrosis pathophysiology and will also hopefully lead to improvement of clinical diagnosis and treatment.

It is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) which is a member of the Phlebovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. SFTSV has been classified as a BSL3 pathogen. There is a need to develop safe and affordable serodiagnostic methods for proper clinical management of infected patients. METHODS: The full length nucleocapsid (N) gene of SFTSV Yamaguchi strain was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned to an expression vector pQE30. The recombinant (r) SFTSV-N protein was expressed by using Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system and purified under native conditions. rSFTSV-N protein based indirect IgG and IgM enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems were established to detect specific human IgG and IgM antibodies, respectively. One hundred fifteen serum samples from clinically suspected-SFTS patients were used to evaluate the newly established systems and the results were compared with the total antibody detecting sandwich ELISA system. RESULTS: The native form of recombinant (r) SFTSV-N protein was expressed and purified. Application of the rSFTSV-N protein based indirect IgG ELISA to the 115 serum samples showed results that perfectly matched those of the total antibody sandwich ELISA with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. The rSFTSV-N protein based indirect IgM ELISA missed 8 positive samples that were detected by the total antibody sandwich ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of rSFTSV-N-IgM capture ELISA were 90.59 and 100 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The rSFTSV-N protein is highly immunoreactive and a good target for use as an assay antigen in laboratory diagnosis. Its preparation is simpler in comparison with that used for the total antibody sandwich system. Our rSFTSV-N protein-based IgG and IgM ELISA systems have the advantage of distinguishing two types of antibodies and require small volume of serum sample only. They are safe to use for diagnosis of SFTS virus infection and especially fit in large-scale epidemiological investigations.","publish_time":"2015-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Fuxun; Du, Yanhua; Huang, Xueyong; Ma, Hong; Xu, Bianli; Adungo, Ferdinard; Hayasaka, Daisuke; Buerano, Corazon C.; Morita, Kouichi","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b62ce73d8d2c9e794c96ce0be7d52ed55b87fa52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4524020.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0350-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFTSV Yamaguchi","IgM ELISA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["rSFTSV-N protein-based IgG","N-IgM capture ELISA","indirect IgM ELISA","IgM ELISA systems","indirect IgG ELISA","sandwich ELISA system","total antibody sandwich ELISA","specificity of rSFTSV","total antibody sandwich system","IgM antibodies","IgM enzyme","serum samples","SFTS patients","results","expression system","established systems","diagnosis of SFTS virus infection","specific human IgG","gene of SFTSV Yamaguchi strain","positive samples","sensitivity","use","native form of recombinant","immunosorbent assay","assay antigen","types of antibodies","Escherichia coli","small volume of serum sample","laboratory diagnosis","native conditions","affordable serodiagnostic methods","expression vector pQE30","proper clinical management of infected patients","immunoreactive","thrombocytopenia syndrome","advantage of distinguishing","Severe fever","good target","length nucleocapsid","Phlebovirus genus","BACKGROUND","RT-PCR","Bunyaviridae family","large-scale epidemiological investigations","need","comparison","emerging disease","member","Application","CONCLUSIONS","preparation","BSL3 pathogen","China"],"language":"en"},

Interferon (IFN) regulates the actions of a large complement of interferon effector genes (IEGs) that prevent viral replication. The interferon inducible transmembrane protein family members, IFITM1, 2 and 3, are IEGs required for inhibition of influenza A virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus replication in vitro. Here we report that IFN prevents emergence of viral genomes from the endosomal pathway, and that IFITM3 is both necessary and sufficient for this function. Notably, viral pseudoparticles were inhibited from transferring their contents into the host cell cytosol by IFN, and IFITM3 was required and sufficient for this action. We further demonstrate that IFN expands Rab7 and LAMP1-containing structures, and that IFITM3 overexpression is sufficient for this phenotype. Moreover, IFITM3 partially resides in late endosomal and lysosomal structures, placing it in the path of invading viruses. Collectively our data are consistent with the prediction that viruses that fuse in the late endosomes or lysosomes are vulnerable to IFITM3\u0027s actions, while viruses that enter at the cell surface or in the early endosomes may avoid inhibition. Multiple viruses enter host cells through the late endocytic pathway, and many of these invaders are attenuated by IFN. Therefore these findings are likely to have significance for the intrinsic immune system\u0027s neutralization of a diverse array of threats.","publish_time":"2011-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feeley, Eric M.; Sims, Jennifer S.; John, Sinu P.; Chin, Christopher R.; Pertel, Thomas; Chen, Li-Mei; Gaiha, Gaurav D.; Ryan, Bethany J.; Donis, Ruben O.; Elledge, Stephen J.; Brass, Abraham L.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e418546d0b83c4b152b9e1200401bba25364427.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3203188.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22046135/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002337","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["IFN","IFITM3 overexpression","Multiple viruses","late endosomes","viral replication","path of invading viruses","dengue virus","host cells","host cell cytosol","endosomal pathway","late endocytic pathway","IEGs","viral pseudoparticles","West Nile virus replication","host cell\u0027s resources","emergence of viral genomes","s actions","early endosomes","cell surface","lysosomal structures","inhibition of influenza","large complement of interferon effector genes","interferon inducible transmembrane protein family members","intrinsic immune system\u0027s neutralization","significance","IFITM1","lysosomes","diverse array of threats","contents","access","prediction","Rab7","LAMP1","phenotype","data","findings","function","invaders"],"language":"en"},

Since CPV-2 emerged as canine pathogen, the original CPV-2 strain has constantly evolved, and its primary variants (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c) co-circulate to varying extents in canine populations worldwide. Thus, rapid and accurate laboratory diagnoses of CPV-2 variants are crucial to monitor CPV-2 evolution. Conventional methods for CPV-2 genotyping are laborious, time consuming, and determining the genotype of a CPV-2 variant often requires two or more reaction tubes. The present study developed a probe-based fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA) for genotyping six different CPV-2 variants (original CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, and vaccine strains of CPVpf and CPVint) in a single reaction tube using only two TaqMan probes. One of the TaqMan probes (FAM labeled) was designed to perfectly match with the target sequence of CPV-2a, this probe allows a 1-bp mismatched hybridization with the CPV-2b VP2 gene region (A4062G), and a 2-bp mismatched hybridization for CPV-2c (A4062G and T4064A); Another TaqMan probe (HEX labeled) was produced to perfectly match with the target sequence of original CPV-2, this probe enables 1-bp mismatched hybridization with the other CPV-2 variants (A3045T). Using the two TaqMan probes, all six CPV-2 variants were readily distinguished by their respective melting temperature values in a single reaction tube. The detection limits of this assay were 1\u201310 copies per reaction for six CPV-2 construction plasmids and no cross reactions were observed with several other common canine viruses. In this assay, co-infected samples were also directly identified via probe-based FMCA without using a mixing control; only a pure control is required. The clinical evaluation of this assay was demonstrated by analyzing 83 clinical fecal samples, among which 41 (49.39%), 8 (9.63%), and 14 (16.87%) samples were found to be positive for CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c, respectively. The concordance rate between probe-based FMCA and Sanger sequencing was 100%. Thus, the duplex FMCA is effective, rapid, simple, high-throughput, and straightforward for genotyping CPV-2 variants, and is useful to effectively diagnose and monitor CPV-2 epidemiology.","publish_time":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zhicheng; Bingga, Gali; Zhang, Chunhong; Shao, Junjie; Shen, Haiyan; Sun, Junying; Zhang, Jianfeng","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42d1823428c311725c7395123a3c2c276b7b5fd1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6411689.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["FMCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genotyping CPV","monitor CPV","different CPV","target sequence of CPV","target sequence of original CPV","accurate laboratory diagnoses of CPV","probe-based FMCA","primary variants","TaqMan probes","probe-based fluorescence","bp mismatched hybridization","assay","single reaction tube","duplex FMCA","reaction tubes","canine pathogen","canine populations","Canine parvovirus","A4062G","co-infected samples","common canine viruses","clinical fecal samples","b VP2 gene region","mixing control","pure control","clinical evaluation","respective melting temperature values","CPVint","curve analysis","high-throughput","vaccine strains of CPVpf","construction plasmids","morbidity","mortality","time consuming","enteric virus","genotype","extents","concordance rate","Sanger sequencing","T4064A","cross reactions","present study","dogs","Conventional methods","copies","detection limits","evolution","FAM","epidemiology","HEX","A3045T"],"language":"en"},

The molecular mechanisms regulating emerging coronavirus pathogenesis are complex and include virus\u2013host interactions associated with entry, replication, egress and innate immune control. Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner. For most of the past two and a half decades, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses antagonize the signaling and sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs upon infection. More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis. In this article, we discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate the mechanisms by which viruses regulate the host epigenome, especially focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections as a model. By combining measures of epigenome reorganization with RNA and proteomic datasets, we articulate a spatial-temporal data integration approach to identify regulatory genomic clusters and regions that play a crucial role in the host\u2019s innate immune response, thereby defining a new viral antagonism mechanism following emerging coronavirus infection.","publish_time":"2017-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00E4fer, Alexandra; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e631c0c0bdbb5cf13818b5b71d39c145b045955.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5371896.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212305/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens6010008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Epigenetics","RNA"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["host epigenome","host chromatin","control host","host interactions","host expression patterns","innate immune control","emerging coronavirus infection","emerging coronavirus pathogenesis","lytic RNA viruses","pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections","immune antiviral defense processes","host\u2019s innate immune response","molecular mechanisms","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","SARS-CoV","non-genetic factors","MERS-CoV","robust virus replication","antiviral defense programs","measures of epigenome reorganization","chromatin remodeling","large group of emerging human","histone modifications","environmental factors","Epigenetic modifications","Epigenetics research","non-coding RNAs","well-coordinated processes","regulatory genomic clusters","important regulators","new viral antagonism mechanism","spatial-temporal data integration approach","animal pathogens","function","hypothesis","crucial role","entry","DNA methylation","regions","change","phenotypic variation","proteomic datasets","networks","performance","egress","sensing components","induction","growing body of evidence","half decades","strains","underlying genotype","flexible manner","Coronaviruses","cytoplasm","article","strategies"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, these four chemokines were dramatically reduced during convalescence. Inversely, the level of MCP-1 was lower in encephalitis patients than FC patients and was not significantly reduced during convalescence. Additionally, MIG was strongly correlated with IP-10 in encephalitis patients. Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of CSF MIG and IP-10 in distinguishing encephalitis from FC were 0.869 and 0.876, and the corresponding sensitivities/specificities were 67.7%/100.0% and 67.7%/95.5%, respectively.

Activation of RLRs in response to viral RNA triggers an antiviral defense program through the production of hundreds of antiviral effector proteins including cytokines, chemokines, and host restriction factors that directly interfere with distinct steps in the virus life cycle. To avoid premature or abnormal antiviral and proinflammatory responses, which could have harmful consequences for the host, the signaling activities of RLRs and their common adaptor molecule, MAVS, are delicately controlled by cell-intrinsic regulatory mechanisms.

By calculating the quantifiers we report that most indices exhibit a behavior equivalent to a persistent stochastic dynamics with Hurst exponents between 0.5 and 0.7. The outbreak of the crisis had changed the dynamical structure of the indices decreasing the level of randomness and increasing considerably their regularity and predictability. Only the index of the Kowloon area seems not impacted by the crisis, exhibiting higher levels of informational efficiency. The results are robust based on the utilization of two different entropy definitions: The Shannon and Tsallis-q entropy. Lastly, with the temporal evolution of the indices, we identify periods where the underlying dynamical structure of the market was impacted by certain events like the SARS epidemic and the imposition of Special Stamp Duty on housing.","publish_time":"2019-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Argyroudis, George S.; Siokis, Fotios M.","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46667c1cd219cd67b59ecf62c47a787ad0f22de2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126015.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437119304194; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437119304194; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2019.04.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288108/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Real Estate Market","SARS","Special Stamp Duty"],"locations":["Kowloon"],"keyphrases":["entropy curve","permutation entropy","housing indices","Tsallis-q entropy","Tsallis complexity","entropy causality plane","different entropy definitions","level of informational efficiency","underlying dynamical structure","sub-prime loan crisis","higher levels of informational efficiency","level of randomness","Real Estate Market of Hong","persistent stochastic dynamics","utilization","Shannon","SARS epidemic","imposition of Special Stamp Duty","impact","behavior equivalent","Hurst exponents","certain events","Kong","periods","terms of size","results","region","Kowloon area","regularity","index","paper","temporal evolution","predictability","outbreak","quantifiers"],"language":"en"},

Radiodermatitis developed 24 days after the first X-irradiation. Reduced spleen weight was observed after the last X-irradiation (P\u003C0.05). Thereafter the weight increased until 24 days after the first irradiation, finally reaching levels comparable to those in the sham-irradiated control group.

This result was similar in other mouse strains. In the irradiated group, LDH A(4) isozyme levels were reduced in the serum until inflammation occurred, whereas those of B(4) isozyme were elevated. The subunits A and B followed a similar trend to that of LDH A(4) and B(4) isozyme, respectively.

As of 19 June 2015, a total of 1,338 MERS-CoV infections have been notified to the World Health Organization (WHO). Clinical illness associated with MERS-CoV ranges from mild upper respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive pneumonia and multi-organ failure. A significant proportion of patients present with non-respiratory symptoms such as headache, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhoea. A few potential therapeutic agents have been identified but none have been conclusively shown to be clinically effective. Human to human transmission is well documented, but the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV remains limited at present. Healthcare-associated clusters of MERS-CoV have been responsible for the majority of reported cases. The largest outbreaks have been driven by delayed diagnosis, overcrowding and poor infection control practices. However, chains of MERS-CoV transmission can be readily interrupted with implementation of appropriate control measures. As with any emerging infectious disease, guidelines for MERS-CoV case identification and surveillance evolved as new data became available. Sound clinical judgment is required to identify unusual presentations and trigger appropriate control precautions. Evidence from multiple sources implicates dromedary camels as natural hosts of MERS-CoV. Camel to human transmission has been demonstrated, but the exact mechanism of infection remains uncertain. The ubiquitously available social media have facilitated communication and networking amongst healthcare professionals and eventually proved to be important channels for presenting the public with factual material, timely updates and relevant advice.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Omrani, A.

Initially, chickens were randomly distributed into 2 groups: the normal group (INC) and the infected group (IIBV). The ilea were collected for morphological assessment, and the ileal contents were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The results of the IIBV group analyses showed a significant decrease in the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P \u003C 0.05), while the goblet cells increased compared to those in the INC group. Furthermore, the microbial diversity in the ilea decreased and overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae and underrepresentation of Chloroplast and Clostridia was found in the NIBV-infected chickens. In conclusion, these results showed that the significant separation of the two groups and the characterization of the gut microbiome profiles of the chickens with NIBV infection may provide valuable information and promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of this disease.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Puzhi; Shi, Yan; Liu, Ping; Yang, Yitian; Zhou, Changming; Li, Guyue; Luo, Junrong; Zhang, Caiying; Cao, Huabin; Hu, Guoliang; Guo, Xiaoquan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d63191505e7cdb2dc1436228923fc97515e2ea1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7044311.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-60564-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32103130/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IIBV","NIBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected group","NIBV-infected chickens","NIBV infection","normal group","IIBV group analyses","intestinal microbiome","groups","results","significant decrease","nephropathogenic IBV","Intestinal microbiota","significant separation","gut microbiome profiles","ratio of villus height","valuable information","serious losses","crypt depth","promising biomarkers","overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae","important role","S rRNA gene sequencing analysis","chicken health","ileal contents","defence","Coronaviridae family","underrepresentation of Chloroplast","diagnosis","morphological assessment","member","Clostridia","link","characterization","Infectious bronchitis virus","poultry industry","microbial diversity","study","colonization","pathogens","disease","goblet cells","aim","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

To establish an infection and spread, MERS-CoV, like most other viruses, must navigate through an intricate network of antiviral host responses. Besides the well-known type I interferon (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) response, the protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated stress response is being recognized as an important innate response pathway. Upon detecting viral dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates eIF2\u03B1, leading to the inhibition of cellular and viral translation and the formation of stress granules (SGs), which are increasingly recognized as platforms for antiviral signaling pathways. It is unknown whether cellular infection by MERS-CoV activates the stress response pathway or whether the virus has evolved strategies to suppress this infection-limiting pathway. Here, we show that cellular infection with MERS-CoV does not lead to the formation of SGs. By transiently expressing the MERS-CoV accessory proteins individually, we identified a role of protein 4a (p4a) in preventing activation of the stress response pathway. Expression of MERS-CoV p4a impeded dsRNA-mediated PKR activation, thereby rescuing translation inhibition and preventing SG formation. In contrast, p4a failed to suppress stress response pathway activation that is independent of PKR and dsRNA. MERS-CoV p4a is a dsRNA binding protein. Mutation of the dsRNA binding motif in p4a disrupted its PKR antagonistic activity. By inserting p4a in a picornavirus lacking its natural PKR antagonist, we showed that p4a exerts PKR antagonistic activity also under infection conditions. However, a recombinant MERS-CoV deficient in p4a expression still suppressed SG formation, indicating the expression of at least one other stress response antagonist. This virus also suppressed the dsRNA-independent stress response pathway. Thus, MERS-CoV interferes with antiviral stress responses using at least two different mechanisms, with p4a suppressing the PKR-dependent stress response pathway, probably by sequestering dsRNA. MERS-CoV p4a represents the first coronavirus stress response antagonist described.","publish_time":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rabouw, Huib H.; Langereis, Martijn A.; Knaap, Robert C.

A new resequencing microarray (RPM-IVDC1) associated with targeted multiplex PCR was recently developed and validated for multiple respiratory viruses detection and discrimination. In this study, we evaluated the capability of RPM-IVDC1 for simultaneous identification of multiple viral and bacterial organisms. The nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) of 110 consecutive CAP patients, aged from 1 month to 96 years old, were collected from five distinct general hospitals in Beijing during 1-year period. The samples were subjected to the RPM-IVDC1 established protocol as compared to a real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), which was used as standard. The results of virus detection were consistent with those previously described. A total of 37 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 14 of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, two of Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of Moraxella catarrhalis were detected by RPM-IVDC1. The sensitivities and specificities were compared with those of qRT-PCR for S. pneumoniae (100, 100%, respectively), H. influenzae (92.3, 97.9%, respectively), M. pneumoniae (69.2, 99.0%, respectively), K. pneumoniae (100, 100%, respectively), and M. catarrhalis (100, 100%, respectively). Additional 22 of Streptococcus spp., 24 of Haemophilus spp. and 16 of Neisseria spp. were identified. In addition, methicillin-resistant and carbapenemases allele were also found in nine of Staphylococcus spp. and one of K. pneumoniae, respectively. These results demonstrated the capability of RPM-IVDC1 for simultaneous detection of broad-spectrum respiratory pathogens in complex backgrounds and the advantage of accessing to the actual sequences, showing great potential use of epidemic outbreak investigation.

As of March 31, 2020, there are now nearly 800,000 cases, with truly global involvement.(2) Countries that were previously unaffected are currently experiencing mounting rates of the novel coronavirus infection with associated increases in COVID-19\u2013related deaths. At present, Canada has more than 8000 cases of COVID-19, with considerable variation in rates of infection among provinces and territories.(3) Amid concerns over growing resource constraints, cardiac surgeons from across Canada have been forced to make drastic changes to their clinical practices. From prioritizing and delaying elective cases to altering therapeutic strategies in high-risk patients, cardiac surgeons, along with their heart teams, are having to reconsider how best to manage their patients. It is with this in mind that the Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons (CSCS) and its Board of Directors have come together to formulate a series of guiding statements. With strong representation from across the country and the support of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, the authors have attempted to provide guidance to their colleagues on the subjects of leadership roles that cardiac surgeons may assume during this pandemic: patient assessment and triage, risk reduction, and real-time sharing of expertise and experiences.

Investigating presence of and associations between these pathogens in healthy individuals is still a rather unexplored field of research, but may have implications for interpreting findings during disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We selected 986 nasopharyngeal samples from 433 6- to 24-month-old healthy children that had participated in a randomized controlled trial. We determined the presence of 20 common respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus were identified by conventional culture methods. Information on risk factors was obtained by questionnaires. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses followed by partial correlation analysis to identify the overall pattern of associations. S. pneumoniae colonization was positively associated with the presence of H. influenzae (adjusted odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.18\u20132.16), M. catarrhalis (1.78, 1.29\u20132.47), human rhinoviruses (1.63, 1.19\u20132.22) and enteroviruses (1.97, 1.26\u20133.10), and negatively associated with S. aureus presence (0.59, 0.35\u20130.98). H. influenzae was positively associated with human rhinoviruses (1.63, 1.22\u20132.18) and respiratory syncytial viruses (2.78, 1.06\u20137.28). M. catarrhalis colonization was positively associated with coronaviruses (1.99, 1.01\u20133.93) and adenoviruses (3.69, 1.29\u201310.56), and negatively with S. aureus carriage (0.42, 0.25\u20130.69). We observed a strong positive association between S. aureus and influenza viruses (4.87, 1.59\u201314.89). In addition, human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were positively correlated (2.40, 1.66\u20133.47), as were enteroviruses and human bocavirus, WU polyomavirus, parainfluenza viruses, and human parechovirus. A negative association was observed between human rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data revealed high viral and bacterial prevalence rates and distinct bacterial-bacterial, viral-bacterial and viral-viral associations in healthy children, hinting towards the complexity and potential dynamics of microbial communities in the upper respiratory tract. This warrants careful consideration when associating microbial presence with specific respiratory diseases.","publish_time":"2012-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Bergh, Menno R.; Biesbroek, Giske; Rossen, John W.

In recent years, epitope-based subunit vaccines have been introduced as a safer alternative to traditional vaccines. However, they suffer from limited immunogenicity. Nanotechnology has shown value in solving this issue. Different kinds of nanovaccines have been employed, among which virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) and self-assembled peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) seem very promising. Recently, SAPNs have attracted special interest due to their unique properties, including molecular specificity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. They also resemble pathogens in terms of their size. Their multivalency allows an orderly repetitive display of antigens on their surface, which induces a stronger immune response than single immunogens. In vaccine design, SAPN self-adjuvanticity is regarded an outstanding advantage, since the use of toxic adjuvants is no longer required. SAPNs are usually composed of helical or \u03B2-sheet secondary structures and are tailored from natural peptides or de novo structures. Flexibility in subunit selection opens the door to a wide variety of molecules with different characteristics. SAPN engineering is an emerging area, and more novel structures are expected to be generated in the future, particularly with the rapid progress in related computational tools. The aim of this review is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of self-assembled peptide nanoparticles and their use in vaccine design in recent studies. Additionally, principles for their design and the application of computational approaches to vaccine design are summarized.","publish_time":"2017-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Negahdaripour, Manica; Golkar, Nasim; Hajighahramani, Nasim; Kianpour, Sedigheh; Nezafat, Navid; Ghasemi, Younes","journal":"Biotechnol Adv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/235e5cda4dc7631fda5c27fd58f99ee0d261a0a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127164.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28522213/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073497501730054X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2017.05.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S073497501730054X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine design","SAPNs","state-of-the-art overview of self-assembled peptide nanoparticles","SAPN self-adjuvanticity","novo structures","novel structures","epitope-based subunit vaccines","recent years","\u03B2-sheet secondary structures","subunit selection","recent studies","traditional vaccines","SAPN engineering","different characteristics","application of computational approaches","related computational tools","use of toxic adjuvants","Different kinds of nanovaccines","door","VLPs","wide variety of molecules","molecular specificity","surface","rapid progress","emerging area","outstanding advantage","stronger immune response","orderly repetitive display of antigens","unique properties","natural peptides","biodegradability","single immunogens","safer alternative","successful breakthroughs","medical history","multivalency","biocompatibility","review","Flexibility","value","pathogens","terms","size","future","virus","principles","limited immunogenicity","Nanotechnology","issue","aim","Vaccination"],"language":"en"},

In human VHF cases, extensive analyses of the humoral immune responses in survivors and non-survivors have shown that the IgG responses to nucleoprotein (NP) and other viral proteins are associated with asymptomatic and survival outcomes, and that the neutralizing antibody responses targeting ebolaviruses glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) are the major indicator of protective immunity. On the other hand, the immune responses in non-human primates, especially naturally infected ones, have not yet been elucidated in detail, and the significance of the antibody responses against NP and GP(1,2) in RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the humoral immune responses of cynomolgus macaque by using serum specimens obtained from the RESTV epizootic in 1996 in the Philippines to expand our knowledge on the immune responses in naturally RESTV-infected non-human primates. RESULTS: The antibody responses were analyzed using IgG-ELISA, an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), and a pseudotyped VSV-based neutralizing (NT) assay. Antigen-capture (Ag)-ELISA was also performed to detect viral antigens in the serum specimens. We found that the anti-GP(1,2) responses, but not the anti-NP responses, closely were correlated with the neutralization responses, as well as the clearance of viremia in the sera of the RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques. Additionally, by analyzing the cytokine/chemokine concentrations of these serum specimens, we found high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IFN\u03B3, IL8, IL-12, and MIP1\u03B1, in the convalescent phase sera. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that both the antibody response to GP(1,2) and the proinflammatory innate responses play significant roles in the recovery from RESTV infection in cynomolgus macaques.","publish_time":"2012-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taniguchi, Satoshi; Sayama, Yusuke; Nagata, Noriyo; Ikegami, Tetsuro; Miranda, Mary E; Watanabe, Shumpei; Iizuka, Itoe; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Ishii, Yoshiyuki; Saijo, Masayuki; Akashi, Hiroomi; Yoshikawa, Yasuhiro; Kyuwa, Shigeru; Morikawa, Shigeru","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3528628.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23057674/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-189","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":["Philippines"],"keyphrases":["IgG responses","neutralization responses","neutralizing antibody responses","anti-NP responses","proinflammatory innate responses","humoral immune responses of cynomolgus macaque","RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques","RESTV-infected non-human primates","RESTV infection","RESTV epizootic","non-survivors","serum specimens","anti-GP","infected ones","indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay","IgG-ELISA","human VHF cases","viral proteins","viral antigens","humans","RESULTS","lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers","high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines","ebolaviruses glycoprotein","chemokine concentrations","convalescent phase sera","pseudotyped VSV-based neutralizing","VHFs","extensive analyses","recovery","significant roles","chemokines","IFA","exceptions of Reston virus","IFN\u03B3","MIP1\u03B1","survival outcomes","BACKGROUND","nucleoprotein","major indicator of protective immunity","IL8","Philippines","clearance of viremia","knowledge","significance","hand","Antigen-capture","study","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

A monoclonal antibody (MAb) (designated as 15E2) against the IBV M protein was prepared and a series of 14 partially-overlapping fragments of the IBV M gene were expressed with a GST tag. These peptides were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting analysis using MAb 15E2 to identify the epitope. A linear motif, (199)FATFVYAK(206), which was located at the C-terminus of the M protein, was identified by MAb 15E2. ELISA and western blotting also showed that this epitope could be recognized by IBV-positive serum from chicken. Given that 15E2 showed reactivity with the (199)FATFVYAK(206) motif, expressed as a GST fusion protein, in both western blotting and in an ELISA, we proposed that this motif represented a linear B-cell epitope of the M protein. The (199)FATFVYAK(206) motif was the minimal requirement for reactivity as demonstrated by analysis of the reactivity of 15E2 with several truncated peptides that were derived from the motif. Alignment and comparison of the 15E2-defined epitope sequence with the sequences of other corona-viruses indicated that the epitope is well conserved among chicken and turkey coronaviruses.

We aimed to examine whether serum YKL-40 and growth factors could be markers for PIBO exacerbation. Thirty-seven children admitted with acute exacerbation of PIBO were enrolled and studied retrospectively. Diagnosis of PIBO was based on clinical history of acute respiratory infection followed by persistent airway obstruction and characteristic findings in high-resolution computed tomography. Serum levels of YKL-40, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B21, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB were measured on admission. The biomarkers were also examined in children admitted with acute bronchiolitis serving as positive controls (N = 30) and in age-matched controls (N = 20). Only YKL-40 levels were found to be significantly higher in PIBO patients with exacerbation compared with that in bronchiolitis patients and showed a positive correlation with the severity of disease before diagnosis of PIBO.

However, the pathogenesis of PHEV and the relationship between PHEV and the host cells are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated whether the PHEV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was caused by apoptosis. Replication of PHEV in a porcine kidney-derived cell line (PK-15 cells) caused an extensive CPE, leading to the destruction of the entire monolayer and the death of the infected cells. Staining with Hoechst 33,342 revealed morphological changes in the nuclei and chromatin fragmentation. In addition, PHEV caused DNA fragmentation detectable by agarose gel electrophoresis 48h post-infection, increasing with the incubation time. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased with the incubation time and reached a maximum at 96h post-infection, as determined using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy of cells that were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). Moreover, as is commonly observed for coronavirus infections of other animals, the activities of the effecter caspase, caspase-3, and the initiator caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-9, which are representative factors in the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, respectively, were increased in PHEV-infected PK-15 cells. Moreover, the tripeptide pan-ICE (caspase) inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK blocked PHEV-induced apoptosis but did not have an effect on virus production by 96h post-infection. These results suggested that PHEV induces apoptosis in PK-15 cells via a caspase-dependent pathway. Apoptotic death of infected cells is detrimental to animals because it causes cell and tissue destruction. Although the pathological characteristics of PHEV are largely unknown, apoptosis may be the pathological basis of the lesions resulting from PHEV infection.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; Wang, Gaili; Dong, Bo; Zhao, Jiakuan; Tang, Bo; Lu, Huijun; Gao, Wei; Chang, Lingzhu; Jin, Zhao; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83e934a16d3fcdcac78ed1b0608536864411079e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114423.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213002025; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.05.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213002025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23770152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV","Hoechst"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PHEV infection","Replication of PHEV","pathogenesis of PHEV","PHEV-infected PK","pathological characteristics of PHEV","Apoptotic death of infected cells","host cells","percentage of apoptotic cells","FMK blocked PHEV-induced apoptosis","effecter caspase","h post-infection","fluorescence microscopy of cells","caspase-dependent pathway","mitochondrial apoptotic pathway","porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","animals","Abstract Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis","death receptor","incubation time","porcine kidney-derived cell line","chromatin fragmentation","virus production","pathological basis","cytopathic effect","extensive CPE","tissue destruction","DNA fragmentation detectable","agarose gel electrophoresis","inhibitor Z-VAD","morphological changes","flow cytometry","propidium iodide","annexin V-FITC","activities","maximum","relationship","nuclei","piglets","tripeptide pan-ICE","addition","lesions","contagious disease","representative factors","entire monolayer","Staining","Hoechst","initiator caspases","coronavirus infections","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Given that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has demonstrated stability, we posited that phosphate buffered saline (PBS) may be a viable transport medium, as an alternative to VTM), for clinical qPCR testing. We assessed the intra- and inter-individual reliability of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR in clinical endotracheal secretion samples transported in VTM or PBS, evaluating the stability of the RT-qPCR signal for three viral targets (N gene, ORF1ab, and S gene) when samples were stored in these media at room temperature for up to 18 hours. We report that using PBS as a transport medium has high intra-and inter-individual reliability, maintains viral stability, and is comparable to VTM in the detection of the three SARS-CoV-2 genes through 18 hours of storage. Our study establishes PBS as a clinically useful medium that can be readily deployed for transporting and short-term preservation of specimens containing SARS-CoV-2. Use of PBS as a transport medium has the potential to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2, aiding more widespread screening and early diagnosis of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radbel, Jared; Jagpal, Sugeet; Roy, Jason; Brooks, Andrew; Tischfield, Jay; Sheldon, Michael; Bixby, Christian; Witt, Dana; Gennaro, Maria Laura; Horton, Daniel B.; Barrett, Emily S.; Carson, Jeffrey L.; Panettieri, Reynold A.; Blaser, Martin J.","journal":"J Mol Diagn","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da98d42fbc1fd8597aca988834cd5543d934d29b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219422.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525157820303238?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2020.04.209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405270/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525157820303238","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","PBS","VTM","viral stability","viable transport medium","inter-individual reliability of SARS","availability of viral transport media","clinical qPCR testing","viral targets","viral RNA","useful medium","testing capacity","diagnostic testing","RT-qPCR signal","early diagnosis of COVID","N gene","clinical endotracheal secretion samples","S gene","hours of storage","ORF1ab","world","alternative","potential","widespread screening","genes","detection","phosphate buffered saline","short-term preservation of specimens","pandemic sweeps","delays","room temperature","study"],"language":"en"},

Most episodes are initiated by viral infections, and airway bacteria also contribute. Viral respiratory infections are universal during infancy, but only a subset of infants develop illnesses with wheezing. Risk factors for wheezing illnesses include small lung size, prematurity, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Most children with recurrent wheezing improve with time, but approximately one-third of infants with recurrent wheeze go on to develop asthma. There is great interest in identifying which infants are at risk for asthma, so that efforts at prevention can be directed toward those who might benefit the most. Factors related to the progression from recurrent wheezing to asthma include those related to the host, pathogen, and environment or lifestyle. Early onset of atopy is an important host factor, and children who become sensitized to multiple allergens in early life are at greatest risk. Children who wheeze with rhinoviruses are also likely to develop asthma, and this is especially true for atopic children. These associations are well established, but whether viral illnesses cause asthma is controversial. Clinical studies have identified predisposing factors such as low lung function and atopy that promote virus-induced wheezing illnesses. In addition, there is evidence from intervention studies that virus-induced damage to the airways can cause recurrent wheezing in some children. These relationships are not mutually exclusive, and it is likely that both apply to the relationship between virus-induced wheezing illnesses and asthma. The implications are that antiviral strategies as well as those targeting atopy and promoting lung development may be useful to prevent childhood asthma.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coleman, Amaziah; Gern, James E.","journal":"Allergy, Immunity and Tolerance in Early Childhood","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd32c3a79eb4883b60dfc49d82c09004e6054d69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173475.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012420226900005X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012420226900005X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abstract Recurrent wheezing illnesses","viral illnesses","childhood asthma","sign of asthma","recurrent wheeze","Risk factors","atopic children","viral infections","virus-induced damage","lung development","infancy","predisposing factors","Early onset of atopy","Viral respiratory infections","greatest risk","subset of infants","small lung size","low lung function","early life","intervention studies","Clinical studies","important host factor","prematurity","multiple allergens","exposure","airways","pathogen","evidence","progression","tobacco smoke","environment","airway bacteria","efforts","rhinoviruses","time","antiviral strategies","implications","lifestyle","addition","episodes","prevention","relationships","associations"],"language":"en"},

In this perspective, to support the National Health Care System and to minimize the impact of this rapidly spreading virus, the Italian Ministry of Health involved the Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali (IZSs), Veterinary Public Health Institutes, in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by testing human samples. IZSAM, is currently testing more than 600 samples per day and WGS from positive samples.

However, compliance rates with recommended hand hygiene practices in hospitals remain low. Previous literature on ways to improve hand hygiene practices has focused on the USA and Europe, whereas studies from developing countries are less common. In this study, we sought to identify common issues and potential strategies for improving hand hygiene practices in hospitals in China. We used a qualitative survey design based on in-depth interviews with 25 key hospital and public health staff in eight hospitals selected by the Chinese Ministry of Health. We found that hospital workers viewed hand hygiene as paramount to effective infection control and had adequate knowledge about proper hand hygiene practices. Despite these positive attitudes and adequate knowledge, critical challenges to improving rates of proper hand hygiene practices were identified. These included lack of needed resources, limited organisational authority of hospital infection control departments, and ineffective use of data monitoring and feedback to motivate improvements. Our study suggests that a pivotal issue for improving hand hygiene practice in China is providing infection control departments adequate attention, priority, and influence within the hospital, with a clear line of authority to senior management. Elevating the place of infection control on the hospital organisational chart and changing the paradigm of surveillance to continuous monitoring and effective data feedback are central to achieving improved hand hygiene practices and quality of care.","publish_time":"2009-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, C.

The proposed mechanism of action involves CsA binding to Leishmania major-expressed cyclophilin and subsequent down-regulation of signaling events necessary for establishing productive infection. Recently, we identified a ubiquitously expressed membrane protein, CD147, as a signaling receptor for extracellular cyclophilins in mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate that, while being enzymatically active, the Leishmania cyclophilin, unlike its human homologue, does not interact with CD147 on the cell surface of target cells. CD147 facilitates neither Leishmania binding nor infection. Primary structure and biochemical analyses revealed that the parasite\u2019s cyclophilin is defective in heparan binding, an event required for signaling interaction between CD147 and human cyclophilin. When the heparan-binding motif was reconstituted in Leishmania cyclophilin, it regained the CD147-dependent signaling activity. These results underscore a critical role of cyclophilin-heparan interactions in CD147-mediated signaling events and argue against the role of Leishmania cyclophilin in parasite binding to target cells.","publish_time":"2008-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yurchenko, Vyacheslav; Xue, Zhu; Sherry, Barbara; Bukrinsky, Michael","journal":"International Journal for Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a48f78dc18c119c9c5662d8af73a99ba443ae7cf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a2d35baa0f897c95d84a74c2c1e73ce53c7b143f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2377454.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2377454?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751907003700; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020751907003700","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leishmania"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Leishmania binding","role of Leishmania cyclophilin","human cyclophilin","parasite\u2019s cyclophilin","heparan binding","parasite binding","CsA binding","CD147-dependent","critical role of cyclophilin","heparan-binding motif","human cell infection","pathogenic protozoan parasite Leishmania major","heparan interactions","cell surface of target cells","mammalian cells","productive infection","human homologue","events necessary","biochemical analyses","receptor","proposed mechanism of action","potent immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin","extracellular cyclophilins","regulation","Primary structure","results","membrane protein","activity"],"language":"en"},

Distribution of substitution categories per codon positions, as well as synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in coding regions of annotated isolates, was determined, along with amino acid (a.a.) property changes. Similar analysis was performed for the spike (S) protein in all the isolates (55 of them being predicted for the first time). The ratio Ka/Ks confirmed that the S gene was subjected to the Darwinian selection during virus transmission from animals to humans. Isolates from the dataset were classified according to genome polymorphism and genotypes. Genome polymorphism yields to two groups, one with a small number of SNVs and another with a large number of SNVs, with up to four subgroups with respect to insertions and deletions. We identified three basic nine-locus genotypes: TTTT/TTCGG, CGCC/TTCAT, and TGCC/TTCGT, with four subgenotypes.

The MERS-CoV was first reported in 2012 and has since infected more than 1600 patients in 26 countries, mostly in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The epidemiology of the infection is compatible with multiple introductions of the virus into humans from an animal reservoir, probably dromedary camels. The clinical presentation ranges from no symptoms to severe pneumonitis and respiratory failure. Most confirmed cases so far were part of MERS-CoV clusters in hospital settings, affecting mainly middle-aged men and patients with a chronic disease or immuno-suppressed status. There is no vaccine or anti-viral medication available. Viral epidemics can occur anywhere in today\u2019s \u201Cglobal village\u201D. MERS-CoV is a relatively new virus, and this work is intended to add to the still-sparse data on its epidemiology, modes of transmission, natural history, and clinical features as well as to describe the preparedness plan for MERS-CoV infection in several countries. Effective national and international preparedness plans are essential to predict and control outbreaks, improve patient management, and ensure global health security.","publish_time":"2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shapiro, Michael; London, Beny; Nigri, Daniel; Shoss, Alon; Zilber, Eyal; Fogel, Itay","journal":"Disaster Mil Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de207527ab4b8826e6e8901d63e768c19691b178.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5329956.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40696-016-0019-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28265443/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV clusters","countries","clinical presentation ranges","clinical features","current epidemiology","patients","clinical presentation of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","international preparedness plans","respiratory failure","new virus","Viral epidemics","global village","global health security","anti-viral medication available","symptoms","chronic disease","hospital settings","patient management","middle-aged men","severe pneumonitis","modes of transmission","natural history","animal reservoir","humans","multiple introductions","control outbreaks","immuno-suppressed status","vaccine","today\u2019s","Saudi Arabia","dromedary camels","sparse data","article","work","confirmed cases"],"language":"en"},

This study evaluates the phenolic compound production, antioxidant and antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral) activities of transgenic hairy root cultures in M. dioica . Hairy roots were induced from leaves, petiole, and internodal explants. Molecular analysis of PCR and gene sequencing using specific primers of rolC and aux1 revealed T-DNA integration in the hairy root clones and RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of hairy root inducible genes (rolC and aux1). The greatest biomass accumulation of hairy roots on MS liquid medium supplemented with 3% sucrose was observed at 22 days. Ultra-HPLC was used to compare the individual phenolic compound contents of transgenic and non-transgenic roots. Moreover, transgenic hairy roots efficiently produced several phenolic compounds, such as flavonols, hydroxycinnamic acid and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives. The total phenolic, flavonoid contents and biological (antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral) activities were higher in hairy roots compared to non-transformed roots. These results demonstrate the greater potentiality of M. dioica hairy root cultures for the production of valuable phenolic compounds and for studies of their biological activity.","publish_time":"2016-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thiruvengadam, Muthu; Rekha, Kaliyaperumal; Chung, Ill-Min","journal":"Scientia Horticulturae","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7398840f44a37ae50c0c5da49c4b423a070b271.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116902.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287883/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423815303083; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304423815303083; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.035","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. dioica"],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transgenic hairy roots","hairy root clones","dioica hairy root cultures","activities of transgenic hairy root cultures","non-transgenic roots","greatest biomass accumulation of hairy roots","hairy root induction of spine gourd","expression of hairy root inducible genes","phenolic compound production","non-transformed roots","individual phenolic compound contents of transgenic","production of valuable phenolic compounds","antiviral","antioxidant","Momordica dioica","aux1","RT-PCR analysis","Molecular analysis of PCR","flavonoid contents","hydroxycinnamic acid","biological activity","specific primers of rolC","hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives","gene sequencing","MS liquid medium supplemented","T-DNA integration","flavonols","greater potentiality","studies","leaves","efficient protocol","sucrose","petiole","Agrobacterium rhizogenes","internodal explants","study","KCTC","results","Ultra-HPLC","days"],"language":"en"},

These factors have not only contributed to the disparate health status of the region\u0027s diverse populations, but also to the diverse nature of its health systems, which are at varying stages of evolution. Rapid but inequitable socioeconomic development, coupled with differing rates of demographic and epidemiological transitions, have accentuated health disparities and posed great public health challenges for national health systems, particularly the control of emerging infectious diseases and the rise of non-communicable diseases within ageing populations. While novel forms of health care are evolving in the region, such as corporatised public health-care systems (government owned, but operating according to corporate principles and with private-sector participation) and financing mechanisms to achieve universal coverage, there are key lessons for health reforms and decentralisation. New challenges have emerged with rising trade in health services, migration of the health workforce, and medical tourism. Juxtaposed between the emerging giant economies of China and India, countries of the region are attempting to forge a common regional identity, despite their diversity, to seek mutually acceptable and effective solutions to key regional health challenges. In this first paper in the Lancet Series on health in southeast Asia, we present an overview of key demographic and epidemiological changes in the region, explore challenges facing health systems, and draw attention to the potential for regional collaboration in health.","publish_time":"2011-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chongsuvivatwong, Virasakdi; Phua, Kai Hong; Yap, Mui Teng; Pocock, Nicola S; Hashim, Jamal H; Chhem, Rethy; Wilopo, Siswanto Agus; Lopez, Alan D","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f42701678d9b9435922bd1d3c102fde215b24219.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159068.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61507-3; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673610615073; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673610615073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21269685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid"],"locations":["Southeast Asia","China","India","Asia"],"keyphrases":["health services","health disparities","health workforce","health reforms","national health systems","key regional health challenges","disparate health status","great public health challenges","corporatised public health-care systems","novel forms of health care","New challenges","key lessons","overview of key demographic","region of enormous social","regional collaboration","Southeast Asia","countries","region\u0027s diverse populations","common regional identity","rising trade","epidemiological transitions","epidemiological changes","control of emerging infectious diseases","ageing populations","political diversity","diverse nature","differing rates of demographic","major crossroad of trade","rise of non-communicable diseases","emerging giant economies of China","India","migration","effective solutions","financing mechanisms","private-sector participation","position","universal coverage","Lancet Series","attention","inequitable socioeconomic development","movement of goods","potential","decentralisation","government","corporate principles","geography","history","varying stages of evolution","medical tourism","paper","factors"],"language":"en"},

To facilitate the identification of new distantly related members of the family Coronaviridae, we have developed a molecular assay with broad specificity. The consensus-degenerated hybrid oligonucleotide primer (CODEHOP) strategy was modified to design primers targeting the most conserved motifs in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase locus. They were evaluated initially on RNA templates from virus-infected cells using a two-step RT-PCR protocol that was further advanced to a one-step assay. The sensitivity of the assay ranged from 102 to 106 and from 105 to 109 RNA copy numbers for individual corona-/torovirus templates when tested, respectively, with and without an excess of RNA from human cells. This primer set compared to that designed according to the original CODEHOP rules showed 10\u2013103 folds greater sensitivity for 5 of the 6 evaluated corona-/torovirus templates. It detected 57% (32 of 56) of the respiratory specimens positive for 4 human coronaviruses, as well as stool specimens positive for a bovine torovirus. The high sensitivity and broad virus range of this assay makes it suitable for screening biological specimens in search for new viruses of the family Coronaviridae.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zlateva, Kalina T.; Crusio, Kelly M.; Leontovich, Andrey M.; Lauber, Chris; Claas, Eric; Kravchenko, Alexander A.; Spaan, Willy J.M.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f558e3046f1472abb3df752a61adc9215467718f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112876.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.08.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093411003235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21864579/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093411003235","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA templates","excess of RNA","family Coronaviridae","torovirus templates","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase locus","molecular assay","one-step assay","RNA copy numbers","respiratory specimens positive","stool specimens positive","human cells","human coronaviruses","bovine torovirus","evaluated corona","high sensitivity","screening biological specimens","virus-infected cells","broad virus range","folds greater sensitivity","new viruses","individual corona","identification of new","broad specificity","primer set","original CODEHOP rules","consensus-degenerated hybrid oligonucleotide primer","search","two-step RT-PCR protocol","strategy","toroviruses","subfamilies","related members","conserved motifs","primers","enteric infections","ssRNA"],"language":"en"},

The pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus that emerged in humans in 2009 contained a unique combination of genes originating in swine and the global human population was highly susceptible to the novel strain. The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2003, and the ensuing worldwide epidemic, highlights the fact that respiratory viral infections in humans may originate in animals.

The resulting cell secretes not only the immunoglobulins of both parents but also hybrid molecules manifesting the binding characteristics of the individual fusion partners. Purification of the desired bispecific immunoprobe with high specific activity from a mixture of bispecific and monospecific monoclonal antibodies requires special strategies. Using a dual, sequential affinity chromatography (Protein-G chromatography followed by m-aminophenyleboronic acid agarose column), we have purified bispecific monoclonal antibodies (BsMAb) as a preformed HRPO (Horseradish Peroxidase) complex (BsMAb\u2013HRPO). The quadroma culture supernatant was initially processed on a Protein-G column to isolate all the species of immunoglobulins. This pre-enriched fraction was subsequently passed through the aminophenyleboronic acid column super saturated with HRPO. The column matrix has the ability to bind to proteins such as HRPO with vicinal diols. The enzyme loaded column captures the desired bispecific anti-SARS-CoV \u00D7 anti-HRPO species with the elimination of the monospecific anti-SARS-CoV MAb to result in a high specific activity diagnostic probe. The presence of anti-HRPO MAb is an acceptable impurity as it will not bind to the target SARS-CoV NP antigen and will get washed out during the ELISA procedure.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhatnagar, Pravin K.; Das, Dipankar; Suresh, Mavanur R.","journal":"Journal of Chromatography B","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3cfc4dab5d54f17baa4dbf0887b3c0b8bf862b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2678934.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2008.01.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18258500/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570023208000172; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570023208000172","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRPO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-HRPO species","preformed HRPO","presence of anti-HRPO MAb","desired bispecific anti-SARS-CoV","Protein-G column","column matrix","monospecific anti-SARS-CoV MAb","bispecific monoclonal antibodies","mixture of bispecific","aminophenyleboronic acid agarose column","desired bispecific immunoprobe","aminophenyleboronic acid column super saturated","monospecific monoclonal antibodies","Protein-G chromatography","BsMAb","species of immunoglobulins","Hybrid hybridomas","target SARS-CoV NP antigen","high specific activity diagnostic probe","hybrid molecules","sequential affinity chromatography","binding characteristics","complex","elimination","Horseradish Peroxidase","special strategies","individual fusion partners","proteins","acceptable impurity","different antibody of predefined specificity","parents","ability","vicinal diols","Purification","enzyme","quadroma culture supernatant","pre-enriched fraction","resulting cell","quadromas","ELISA procedure"],"language":"en"},

METHOD: Information on 7,015 confirmed cases from January 19 to February 8, 2020, in all provinces outside Hubei was collected from the national and local health commissions in China. Incubation period and interval times were calculated using dates of the following events: contact with an infected person, onset, first visit and diagnosis. We evaluated changes in incubation period and interval times. RESULTS: The average age of all cases was 44.24 years old. The median incubation period was 5 days and extended from 2 days on January 23 to 15 days on February 8. The proportion of imported cases decreased from 85.71% to 33.19% after January 23. In addition, the lengths of the intervals between onset and diagnosis, onset and first visit, and first visit and diagnosis decreased over time.

METHODS: A retrospective study of 100 COVID-19 pneumonia patients without ARDS was performed, and CT scans were reviewed. A COVID-19 pneumonia course diagram was drawn. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the lesion distribution and CT scores, \u03C7(2) test was used to compare the CT findings between different stages. RESULTS: A total of 272 CT scans from 100 patients (mean age, 52.3 years \u00B1 13.1) were investigated. Four patients with lung abnormalities on CT first showed negative RT-PCR result and turned positive afterwards. One hundred sixty-nine (62.1%) showed predominantly peripheral distribution. The CT scores of the upper zone (3.4 \u00B1 3.6) were significantly lower than those of the middle (5.0 \u00B1 3.9) and lower (4.8 \u00B1 3.6) zones (p \u003C 0.001). The CT scores of the anterior zones (4.9 \u00B1 4.7) were significantly lower than those of the posterior zones (8.4 \u00B1 6.2) (p \u003C 0.001). In the early rapid progressive stage (1~7 days), ground glass opacity (GGO) plus reticular pattern (58.1%), GGO plus consolidation (43.0%), and GGO (41.9%) were all common. In the advanced stage (8~14 days), GGO plus consolidation (79.8%) and repairing CT signs (subpleural line, bronchus distortion, and fibrotic strips) showed a significant increase (p \u003C 0.05).

Methods:Subjects (n = 40) were recruited at hospital admission for acute asthma exacerbation. Respiratory virus infection was diagnosed by viral nucleic acid detection and/or cell culture, using induced sputum, nasal, or throat swabs. Data collected included lung function, answers to common cold and asthma control questionnaires, and induced sputum cellular profiles. Subjects were reexamined 4 to 6 weeks postexacerbation and were compared with stable asthmatic subjects (n = 26) who had been recruited from ambulatory care clinics. Results:Persistent airway obstruction, defined as lung function improvement at follow-up (ie, change in FEV1percent predicted [\u0394%FEV1]) of \u003C15%, was observed in 10 subjects (25%). Airway recovery (\u0394%FEV1, \u2265 15%) was observed in the remaining subjects (30 subjects; 75%). During the acute episode, the airway-recovery group had increased total cell count (p = 0.019), increased number of neutrophils (p = 0.005), and increased percentage of neutrophils (p = 0.0043) compared to the group of stable subjects with asthma. Postexacerbation, the airway-recovery group had reduced numbers of neutrophils and an increased percentage of eosinophils. In contrast, during exacerbation, subjects with persistent airway obstruction showed no differences in inflammatory cell counts compared to stable subjects with asthma, nor did cell counts change postexacerbation. Symptoms improved in both groups postexacerbation. However, in the persistent-airway-obstruction group, asthma remained uncontrolled. Conclusion:Persistent airway obstruction and uncontrolled asthma are observed in some people after viral asthma exacerbations. These abnormalities are not associated with inflammatory cell influx into the airway lining fluid during the exacerbation and may reflect the involvement of noncellular elements.

We characterized specific infections and outcomes in adults undergoing UCBT at our 2 centers. METHODS: All adults who underwent UCBT between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015 were included. Infectious episodes from 6 months before to 2 years after UCBT were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients underwent UCBT; 47 had neutrophil engraftment. A total of 179 infectious episodes occurred in 55 patients, 73 (41%) within 30 days post-UCBT. Viruses caused 85 (47%) infections. Cytomegalovirus caused 32 infectious episodes and was most common from day 30 to 100. Human herpesvirus 6 occurred in 28 episodes, was most common within 30 days, and caused 1 death. Bacteria were responsible for 82 (46%) infections, most commonly bacteremias due to Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, and Enterobacteriaceae. Of 11 invasive fungal infections, 9 were aspergillosis, 4 of which were fatal. Overall mortality was 56% in the first year. Thirteen deaths were from infection; 11 occurred in the first 100 days and 7 in the first 30 days post-UCBT. Of 10 patients who never engrafted, 9 died, 6 from infection, within 100 days post-UCBT. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious complications were common after UCBT, especially in the first 30 days. Deaths from viral infections were fewer than expected. Delayed engraftment and nonengraftment continue to convey increased risk for fatal bacterial and fungal infections post-UCBT.","publish_time":"2019-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linder, Kathleen A; McDonald, Philip J; Kauffman, Carol A; Revankar, Sanjay G; Chandrasekar, Pranatharthi H; Miceli, Marisa H","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0adc2dfd5f26656ce3527dbb5dec379d44d0601e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6386816.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofz037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815505/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UCBT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days post-UCBT","fungal infections post-UCBT","Infectious episodes","patients","viral infections","specific infections","invasive fungal infections","Infectious complications","adults","neutrophil engraftment","Delayed engraftment","deaths","increased risk","Enterococcus spp","Staphylococcus spp","standard allogeneic transplant","Umbilical cord blood transplant","BACKGROUND","nonengraftment","bacteremias","aspergillosis","outcomes","months","Enterobacteriaceae","fewer","CONCLUSIONS","matched donor","Human herpesvirus","years","centers","METHODS","total","Cytomegalovirus","RESULTS","Overall mortality","Viruses"],"language":"en"},

Few population\u2010based studies of cattle have investigated how the microbiota is impacted during diarrhea. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the fecal microbiota and predict the functional potential of the microbial communities in healthy and diarrheic calves. METHODS: Fifteen diarrheic calves between the ages of 1 and 30 days and 15 age\u2010matched healthy control calves were enrolled from 2 dairy farms. The Illumina MiSeq sequencer was used for high\u2010throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (Illumina, San Diego, CA). RESULTS: Significant differences in community membership and structure were identified among healthy calves from different farms. Differences in community membership and structure also were identified between healthy and diarrheic calves within each farm. Based on linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), the genera Bifidobacterium, Megamonas, and a genus of the family Bifidobacteriaceae were associated with health at farm 1, whereas Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, Dietzia and an unclassified genus of the family Veillonellaceae were significantly associated with health at farm 2. The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis indicated that diarrheic calves had decreased abundances of genes responsible for metabolism of various vitamins, amino acids, and carbohydrate. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The fecal microbiota of healthy dairy calves appeared to be farm specific as were the changes observed during diarrhea. The differences in microbiota structure and membership between healthy and diarrheic calves suggest that dysbiosis can occur in diarrheic calves and it is associated with changes in predictive metagenomic function.","publish_time":"2017-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gomez, D.E.; Arroyo, L.G.; Costa, M.C.; Viel, L.; Weese, J.S.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1cdea1502a0fd90dbbff6e8a29480d856c03fed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5435056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28390070/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.14695","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Illumina MiSeq"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthy calves","diarrheic calves","fecal microbiota of healthy dairy calves","matched healthy control calves","microbiota structure","community membership","dairy farms","Significant differences","changes","Neonatal diarrhea accounts","microbial communities","unclassified genus","family Veillonellaceae","family Bifidobacteriaceae","different farms","Illumina MiSeq sequencer","based studies of cattle","linear discriminant analysis effect size","Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities Reconstruction of Unobserved States","metabolism of various vitamins","LEfSe","decreased abundances of genes responsible","PICRUSt","S rRNA gene","V4 region","San Diego","functional potential","Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis","amino acids","Dietzia","throughput sequencing","dysbiosis","genera Bifidobacterium","days","RESULTS","CLINICAL RELEVANCE","carbohydrate","population","predictive metagenomic function","Megamonas","BACKGROUND","total deaths","ages","OBJECTIVES","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Astrocytes, the major glial cell population of the central nervous system, were semipermissive for GDVII virus replication. Programmed cell death, demonstrated by apoptosis-specific caspase-3 protease activity, was maximal 8 h after GDVII infection at an m.o.i. of 1. Purified TMEV capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 did not induce apoptosis but antibodies to VP1 and VP2 inhibited it. Antibody inhibition of caspase-3 activity as well as flow cytometry experiments implicated TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNF-\u03B1-receptor (TNF-R) in apoptosis signaling. Converselly, TNF-\u03B1 and the TRAIL-receptor were not upregulated. Furthermore, the number of functional TNF-\u03B1 receptors, but not their affinity, was increased in apoptotic GDVII virus-infected astrocytes, as confirmed in binding experiments with 125I-labeled recombinant murine TNF-\u03B1. In vivo studies showed that most of the cells loaded with the virus when injected in the brains of SJL mice were neurons but very few showed TUNEL costaining.

METHODS: Data from COVID-19 cases were collected from daily notifications given to the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China and Tianjin Health Committee. All of the data were analyzed with SPSS, version 24.0 software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: As of February 24, 2020, there have been 135 confirmed cases, 3 deaths, and 87 recoveries in Tianjin, China. The incidence of COVID-19 was 8.65/1 000 000 with a 2.22% case fatality rate. Regarding geographic distribution, the incidence was 8.82 per 1 000 000 in urban areas and 8.00 per 1 000 000 in suburbs. During the early stage of the epidemic, most cases came from urban areas and in patients with a history of sojourning in Hubei Province. The majority of patients were 31\u201370 years old (75.97%). A familial clustering was the most important characteristic of COVID-19 (accounting for 74.81%).

This poses a significant challenge to coordinated international efforts in global surveillance and infection control. Significantly, respiratory viral infections, spread mostly via droplet transmission, are extremely contagious and have caused significant morbidity and mortality during outbreaks in the last decade. Molecular diagnostics via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been key in the rapid diagnosis of most of these viral infections. However, a high index of suspicion and early institution of appropriate isolation measures remain as the mainstay in the control and containment of the spread of these viral infections. Although treatment for most of the viral infections remains supportive, efficacious antiviral agents against influenza infections exist. The infections discussed in this chapter include those first described in the 2000s: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and metapneumovirus and rhinovirus C as well as those that have been described in the past but have reemerged in the last decade in outbreaks resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, including adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tambyah, Paul; Isa, Mas Suhaila; Tan, Christelle Xian-Ting","journal":"Kendig\u0027s Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fbc60e0d0cc867609bf33d1af4e3431b0d53f1d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323448871000286; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323448871000286","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viral infections","influenza infections","emerging viral infections","spread","significant morbidity","mortality","significant challenge","outbreaks","decade","past","influenza virus","enterovirus D68","rapid diagnosis","infection control","EV-D68","era of rapid globalization","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","MERS-CoV","frequent travel","international efforts","efficacious antiviral agents","early institution of appropriate isolation measures","RT-PCR","adenovirus","Molecular diagnostics","global surveillance","mainstay","immense potential","high index of suspicion","metapneumovirus","unprecedented speed","key","containment","droplet transmission","rhinovirus C","scale","Abstract","treatment","chapter"],"language":"en"},

All confirmed cases are suspected to be hospital-acquired infections except one case of household transmission and two cases still undergoing examination. The Korean health care system has been the major factor shaping the unique characteristics of the outbreak. Taking this as an opportunity, the Korean government should carefully assess the fundamental problems of the vulnerability to hospital infection and make short- as well as long-term plans for countermeasures.

However, little has been published regarding viral or bacterial pathogens that can contribute to influenza-like illness (ILI) in a community setting. We report on the results of a community-based surveillance that prospectively monitored the incidence of ILI and its causative pathogens in Vientiane capital in Lao PDR. A cohort of 995 households, including 4885 study participants, were followed-up between May 2015 and May 2016. Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, and sputum specimens were collected from ILI cases identified through active case-finding. Real-Time PCR was used to test nasopharyngeal swabs for 21 respiratory pathogens, while throat and sputum samples were subjected to bacterial culture. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess potential risk factors for associations with ILI. In total, 548 episodes of ILI were reported among 476 (9.7%) of the study participants and 330 (33.2%) of the study households. The adjusted estimated incidence of ILI within the study area was 10.7 (95%CI: 9.4\u201311.9) episodes per 100 person-years. ILI was significantly associated with age group (p\u003C0.001), sex (p\u003C0.001), and number of bedrooms (p = 0.04) in multivariate analysis. In 548 nasopharyngeal swabs, the most commonly detected potential pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.3%), influenza A (11.1%; mostly subtype H3N2), rhinovirus (7.5%), and influenza B (8.0%). Streptococci were isolated from 42 (8.6%) of 536 throat swabs, most (27) of which were Lancefield Group G. Co-infections were observed in 132 (24.1%) of the 548 ILI episodes. Our study generated valuable data on respiratory disease burden and patterns of etiologies associated with community-acquired acute respiratory illness Laos. Establishment of a surveillance strategy in Laos to monitor trends in the epidemiology and burden of acute respiratory infections is required to minimize their impact on human health.","publish_time":"2019-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rudge, James W.; Inthalaphone, Nui; Pavlicek, Rebecca; Paboriboune, Phimpha; Flaissier, Bruno; Monidarin, Chou; Steenkeste, Nicolas; Davong, Viengmon; Vongsouvath, Manivanh; Bonath, K.

Measures of quality and barriers for rapid use by patients and physicians are not well described. OBJECTIVE To describe results from a quality improvement initiative during rapid adoptive phase of telemedicine during the pandemic. DESIGN Patient and physician satisfaction with synchronous audiovisual telemedicine visits was measured during early adoptive phase (April 6-17, 2020) within the division of sports medicine in an academic Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM\u0026R) department. Patients were invited to participate in a quality improvement initiative by completing an online survey at the end of a telemedicine visit. Physicians completed a separate survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Patient measures included visit type, duration of encounter, quality, and satisfaction. Physicians reported on experiences performing telemedicine. RESULTS Surveys were completed by 119 patients (289 telemedicine encounters, response rate 41%) and 13 physiatrists. Telemedicine was utilized primarily for follow-up visits (n=74, 70.6%) and most common duration was 15-29 minutes. Patients rated their telemedicine visit as \u0022excellent\u0022 or \u0022very good\u0022 across measures (91.6-95.0%) including addressing concerns, communication, developing a treatment plan, convenience, and satisfaction. Value of completing a future telemedicine visit was measured at 84.9%. Most reported estimated travel time saved in excess of 30 minutes. Rate of no-show was 2.8%. Most physicians (62%) had no prior experience with telemedicine visits, and most were comfortable performing these visits after completing 1-4 sessions (69%). Nearly all physicians (92%) rated their telemedicine experience as very good or excellent. The key barrier identified for telemedicine was technical issues. All physicians reported plans to perform telemedicine visits if reimbursement continues. CONCLUSIONS In summary, rapid expansion of telemedicine during COVID-19 pandemic was well-received by a majority of patients and physicians. This suggests feasibility in rapid expansion of telemedicine for other outpatient sports medicine practices. This article is protected by copyright.

The virus has currently evolved into three separated groups including US, China and Southeast Asia (SEA) groups. In Vietnam, PDCoV was first reported in 2015. Based on phylogenetic analyses of spike, membrane and nucleocapsid genes, it is suggested that Vietnam PDCoV is chimeric virus. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated the presence of PDCoV in Vietnam and the full\u2010length genomes of six PDCoV isolates identified in 2014\u20132016 were further characterized. The results demonstrated that Vietnam PDCoV was first detected as early as 2014. All six Vietnam PDCoV are in the SEA group and further divided into two separated subgroups including SEA\u20101 and SEA\u20102. Vietnam PDCoV in SEA\u20102 was closely related to Thai and Lao PDCoV. Recombination analysis demonstrated that three isolates in SEA\u20101 were a chimeric virus of which P12_14_VN_0814, the first Vietnam isolate, and US PDCoV isolates were major and minor parents, respectively. The recombination was further evaluated by phylogenetic construction based on 3 recombinant fragments. The first and third fragments, closely related to P12_14_VN_0814, were associated with ORF1a/1b and N genes, respectively. The second fragment, associated with S, E, and M genes, was closely related to US PDCoV isolates. High antigenic and hydrophobic variations were detected in S1 protein.

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the pandemic, and its corresponding State of Emergency, on a tertiary traumatology emergency service. METHODS: : An observational study was performed at a tertiary hospital within the Spanish National Health System. Four different periods were studied, including the first 20 days of Spain\u0027s current State of Emergency, from March 14 to April 02, 2020 (Period 4). This period was compared to the 20-day period prior to the State of Emergency (Period 3), and to matching periods in the two previous years (Periods 1 and 2). A total of 6,565 patient visits were analyzed: 1909 in Period 1 (29.1%), 2161 in Period 2 (32.9%), 1983 in Period 3 (30.2%), and 512 in Period 4 (7.8%). Variables collected included patient age and sex, insurance type, discharge destination and reason for hospital admission. RESULTS: : The patients\u2019 mean age was 55.1 years old (Standard Deviation (SD): 22.1), and 51.8% were women (3495/6565). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant reductions in total visits to the trauma emergency department, workplace accidents, traffic accidents and number of hospital admissions, particularly during Period 4. However, no statistically-significant differences were found in the number of osteoporotic hip fractures admitted between the four periods. The numbers of hospital admissions for osteoporotic hip fracture were 42 during Period 1, 41 during Period 2, 43 during Period 3 and 36 during Period 4. CONCLUSIONS: : While most traumatological presentations decreased in frequency over the course of the outbreak, the number of osteoporotic hip fractures remained stable. Thus, contingency plans in times of crisis need to be carefully targeted, and to keep in mind certain public health issues that do not decrease, despite a State of Emergency, like osteoporotic hip fractures.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nu\u00F1ez, Jorge H.; Sallent, Andrea; Lakhani, Kushal; Guerra-Farfan, Ernesto; Vidal, Nuria; Ekhtiari, Seper; Minguell, Joan","journal":"Injury","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1396d03790e07276c6afab829b774651518683d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219366.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2020.05.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405089/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020138320304228?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020138320304228","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health System","State of Emergency"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["day period","corresponding State of Emergency","number of osteoporotic hip fractures","number of hospital admissions","tertiary hospital","pandemic","days of Spain\u0027s current State of Emergency","tertiary traumatology emergency service","trauma emergency department","different periods","numbers of hospital admissions","patient visits","total visits","included patient age","traffic accidents","workplace accidents","years old","hospitals\u2019 current service needs","previous years","significant reductions","observational study","significant differences","patients\u2019 mean age","Spanish National Health System","mind certain public health issues","sex","insurance type","discharge destination","reason","redistribution of resources","outbreak","Standard Deviation","coronavirus","frequency","SD","course","Variables","times of crisis","severe disruptions","traumatological presentations","SARS-CoV","contingency plans","RESULTS","overview","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","impact","aim","COVID","women"],"language":"en"},

PCV2 infection is present in every major swine\u2010producing country in the world, and the number of identified cases of PCVAD is rapidly increasing. In the United States, the disease has cost producers an average of 3\u20134 dollars per pig with peak losses ranging up to 20 dollars per pig.

This protease also mediated trans-proteolytic activity and cleaved the polyprotein at the same specific positions.

SP-A and SP-D deal with various pathogens, using a range of innate immune mechanisms such as agglutination/aggregation, enhancement of phagocytosis, and killing mechanisms by phagocytic cells and direct growth inhibition. SP-A and SP-D have also been shown to be involved in the control of pulmonary inflammation including allergy and asthma. Emerging evidence suggest that SP-A and SP-D are capable of linking innate immunity with adaptive immunity that includes modulation of dendritic cell function and helper T cell polarization.

Yet, before population declines are detectable, individuals may suffer from chronic stress and impaired immunity in disturbed habitats, making them more susceptible to pathogens and adverse weather conditions. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the body mass and immunity of bats. We measured and compared body mass, chronic stress (indicated by neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios) and the number of circulating immune cells between several bat species with different roost types living in recovering areas, actively logged forests, and fragmented forests in Sabah, Malaysia. In a cave-roosting species, chronic stress levels were higher in individuals from fragmented habitats compared with conspecifics from actively logged areas. Foliage-roosting species showed a reduced body mass and decrease in total white blood cell counts in actively logged areas and fragmented forests compared with conspecifics living in recovering habitats. Our study highlights that habitat disturbance may have species-specific effects on chronic stress and immunity in bats that are potentially related to the roost type. We identified foliage-roosting species as particularly sensitive to forest habitat deterioration. These species may face a heightened extinction risk in the near future if anthropogenic habitat alterations continue.","publish_time":"2017-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seltmann, Anne; Czirj\u00E1k, G\u00E1bor \u00C1.; Courtiol, Alexandre; Bernard, Henry; Struebig, Matthew J.; Voigt, Christian C.","journal":"Conserv Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f64095c3f030c293ac087d505f3a3f64d110090.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5388297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28421138/; https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/cox020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["Anthropogenic habitat disturbance","Foliage-roosting species","chronic stress levels","bat species","cave-roosting species","fragmented forests","logged forests","logged areas","fragmented habitats","anthropogenic habitat alterations","forest habitat deterioration","immunity of bats","reduced body mass","individuals","impaired immunity","conspecifics","disturbed habitats","paleotropical forest","different roost types","near future","fragmentation","species-specific effects","total white blood cell","ongoing logging","heightened extinction risk","major threat","immune cells","number","adverse weather conditions","pathogens","neutrophil","Sabah","lymphocyte ratios","population declines","biodiversity","Malaysia","study"],"language":"en"},

This analysis reviews national efforts to achieve UHC. With a broad range of health indicators, life expectancy (ranging from 53 years to 73 years), and mortality rate in children younger than 5 years (ranging from 10\u00B73 to 44\u00B76 deaths per 1000 livebirths), a review of progress in each of the BRICS countries shows that each has some way to go before achieving UHC. The BRICS countries show substantial, and often similar, challenges in moving towards UHC. On the basis of a review of each country, the most pressing problems are: raising insufficient public spending; stewarding mixed private and public health systems; ensuring equity; meeting the demands for more human resources; managing changing demographics and disease burdens; and addressing the social determinants of health. Increases in public funding can be used to show how BRICS health ministries could accelerate progress to achieve UHC. Although all the BRICS countries have devoted increased resources to health, the biggest increase has been in China, which was probably facilitated by China\u0027s rapid economic growth. However, the BRICS country with the second highest economic growth, India, has had the least improvement in public funding for health. Future research to understand such different levels of prioritisation of the health sector in these countries could be useful. Similarly, the role of strategic purchasing in working with powerful private sectors, the effect of federal structures, and the implications of investment in primary health care as a foundation for UHC could be explored. These issues could serve as the basis on which BRICS countries focus their efforts to share ideas and strategies.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marten, Robert; McIntyre, Diane; Travassos, Claudia; Shishkin, Sergey; Longde, Wang; Reddy, Srinath; Vega, Jeanette","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/798a9579407783aa04232f05be7b83404261e173.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b454c4803c522778e697cb0d58ac72371b2552d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134989.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(14)60075-1; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673614600751; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673614600751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793339/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UHC","BRICS"],"locations":["Brazil","Russia","India","South Africa","China"],"keyphrases":["BRICS countries","UHC","BRICS health ministries","health sector","public health systems","BRICS country","primary health care","social determinants of health","universal health coverage","broad range of health indicators","public funding","years","insufficient public spending","India","review of progress","basis","highest economic growth","increased resources","human resources","analysis reviews national efforts","national governments","China\u0027s rapid economic growth","powerful private sectors","implications of investment","life expectancy","disease burdens","effect of federal structures","changing demographics","different levels of prioritisation","mortality rate","pressing problems","biggest increase","children younger","South Africa","equity","foundation","improvement","role of strategic purchasing","Future research","demands","livebirths","Brazil","Russia","world\u0027s population","challenges","ideas","work","strategies","way","deaths","issues"],"language":"en"},

Severe cases of H1N1pdm infection are characterized by prolonged activation of the immune response, yet the specific role of inflammatory mediators in disease is poorly understood. The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been implicated in both seasonal and severe pandemic H1N1 influenza A (H1N1pdm) infection. Here, we investigated the role of IL-6 in severe H1N1pdm infection. We found IL-6 to be an important feature of the host response in both humans and mice infected with H1N1pdm. Elevated levels of IL-6 were associated with severe disease in patients hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection. Notably, serum IL-6 levels associated strongly with the requirement of critical care admission and were predictive of fatal outcome. In C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J mice, infection with A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1pdm) consistently triggered severe disease and increased IL-6 levels in both lung and serum. Furthermore, in our lethal C57BL/6J mouse model of H1N1pdm infection, global gene expression analysis indicated a pronounced IL-6 associated inflammatory response. Subsequently, we examined disease and outcome in IL-6 deficient mice infected with H1N1pdm. No significant differences in survival, weight loss, viral load, or pathology were observed between IL-6 deficient and wild-type mice following infection. Taken together, our findings suggest IL-6 may be a potential disease severity biomarker, but may not be a suitable therapeutic target in cases of severe H1N1pdm infection due to our mouse data.","publish_time":"2012-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paquette, St\u00E9phane G.; Banner, David; Zhao, Zhen; Fang, Yuan; Huang, Stephen S.

Humans express two types of defensins, \u03B1- and \u03B2-defensins, which have antiviral activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. The diversity of defensin-sensitive viral species reflects a multitude of antiviral mechanisms. These include direct defensin targeting of viral envelopes, glycoproteins, and capsids in addition to inhibition of viral fusion and post-entry neutralization. Binding and modulation of host cell surface receptors and disruption of intracellular signaling by defensins can also inhibit viral replication. In addition, defensins can function as chemokines to augment and alter adaptive immune responses, revealing an indirect antiviral mechanism. Nonetheless, many questions regarding the antiviral activities of defensins remain. Although significant mechanistic data is known for \u03B1-defensins, molecular details for \u03B2-defensin inhibition are mostly lacking. Importantly, the role of defensin antiviral activity in vivo has not been addressed due to the lack of a complete defensin knockout model. Overall, the antiviral activity of defensins is well established as are the variety of mechanisms by which defensins achieve this inhibition; however, additional research is needed to fully understand the role of defensins in viral pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2013-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Sarah S.; Wiens, Mayim E.; Smith, Jason G.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f005a0677f24f697c1ec3ce065ec4144519e357.json; document_parses/pdf_json/89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3842434.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3842434?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24095897/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283613006220; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2013.09.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283613006220","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity of defensins","\u03B1-defensins","\u03B2-defensins","role of defensins","antiviral activities of defensins","types of defensins","role of defensin antiviral activity","\u03B2-defensin inhibition","inhibition of viral fusion","viral envelopes","viral pathogenesis","viral replication","diversity of defensin","direct defensin","multitude of antiviral mechanisms","indirect antiviral mechanism","sensitive viral species","broad antimicrobial activity","complete defensin knockout model","variety of mechanisms","innate immune system","adaptive immune responses","non-enveloped viruses","modulation of host cell surface receptors","capsids","molecular details","disruption of intracellular","effector component","glycoproteins","post-entry neutralization","Binding","lack","chemokines","significant mechanistic data","questions","additional research","Humans"],"language":"en"},

An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1 and interleukin-10, in PRRS may impair the immune response of the lung. Pulmonary macrophage subpopulations have a range of susceptibilities to different PRRSV strains and different capacities to express cytokines. Infection with PRRSV decreases the bactericidal activity of macrophages, which increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. PRRSV infection is associated with an increase in concentrations of haptoglobin, which may interact with the virus receptor (CD163) and induce the synthesis of anti-inflammatory mediators. The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines modulates the expression of CD163, which may affect the pathogenicity and replication of the virus in different tissues. With the emergence of highly pathogenic PRRSV, there is a need for more information on the immunopathogenesis of different strains of PRRS, particularly to develop more effective vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez-Laguna, Jaime; Salguero, Francisco J.; Pallar\u00E9s, Francisco J.; Carrasco, Librado","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fd207332d8e23eea77fb6d86263b7e47b9cb822.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128372.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23265866/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.11.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023312004844; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023312004844","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different PRRSV strains","PRRSV infection","anti-inflammatory cytokines","pathogenic PRRSV","different capacities","immunopathogenesis of different strains of PRRS","different tissues","express cytokines","virus receptor","local pulmonary immune responses","synthesis of anti-inflammatory mediators","function of porcine alveolar macrophages andinducing apoptosis of immune cells","expression of CD163","bactericidal activity of macrophages","Pulmonary macrophage subpopulations","range of susceptibilities","respiratory syndrome","tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1","mucociliary transport system","susceptibility","interleukin","need","increase","information","replication","secondary bacterial infections","pathogenicity","imbalance","concentrations of haptoglobin","lung","emergence","effective vaccines"],"language":"en"},

Although PEDV was first identified in Europe, it has resulted in significant economic losses in many Asian swine-raising countries, including Korea, China, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. However, from April 2013 to the present, major outbreaks of PEDV have been reported in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Moreover, intercontinental transmission of PEDV has increased mortality rates in seronegative neonatal piglets, resulting in 10% loss of the US pig population. The emergence and re-emergence of PEDV indicates that the virus is able to evade current vaccine strategies. Continuous emergence of multiple mutant strains from several regions has aggravated porcine epidemic diarrhea endemic conditions and highlighted the need for new vaccines based on the current circulating PEDV. Epidemic PEDV strains tend to be more pathogenic and cause increased death in pigs, thereby causing substantial financial losses for swine producers. In this review, we described the epidemiology of PEDV in several countries and present molecular characterization of current strains.

Therefore, we used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to understand dog owners\u2019 behavior and distinguished the knowledge effect as objective knowledge (OK) and subjective knowledge (SK). A total of 310 dog owners completed a questionnaire based on our model. We employed structural equation modeling to verify the structural relationships and found three main results. First, our model was fit, and each path was significant. People with better attitudes, stronger subjective norms, and more perceptive behavioral control have stronger behavioral intention. Second, perceived behavioral control, not attitude, was the best predictive index in this model. Finally, on perceived behavioral control, subjective knowledge showed more influence than objective knowledge. We successfully extended TPB to explain the behavioral intention of dog owners and presented more workable recommendations. To reduce the latent social risk of disease, the government should not only address dog owners\u2019 attitudes, but also their subjective norms and perceptive behavioral control. Indeed, perceptive behavioral control and SK showed the most influence in this model. It is implied that the self-efficacy of dog owners is the most important factor in such a behavior.

Because of the tendency to change its antigenic properties, infectious bronchitis is currently the viral disease present in most poultry producing areas of the world. New serotypes and variant strains are reported in several countries. Current commercially available vaccines do not always provide protection against new field isolates. Vaccination programs are constantly adjusted in an attempt to improve protection against this disease. Infectious laryngotracheitis has appeared in the broiler industry as a serious disease. Improved vaccines are needed to control the disease in broilers. In the U.S., the control of the highly pathogenic forms of avian influenza and the velogenic forms of Newcastle disease have been achieved by eradication. In other countries, effective vaccines have been used to control Newcastle and avian influenza. Avian pneumovirus infection is also an emerging disease of chickens and turkeys.","publish_time":"1998-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Villegas, P","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/887ef0dc296e27f317019b8e1cec781455c1f381.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119409358; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119409358","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["serious disease","emerging disease of chickens","velogenic forms of Newcastle disease","infectious laryngotracheitis","viral disease present","control","pathogenic forms of avian influenza","Abstract Infectious bronchitis","Avian pneumovirus infection","protection","available vaccines","effective vaccines","Improved vaccines","countries","New serotypes","new field isolates","respiratory tract of chickens","poultry","broiler industry","variant strains","areas","antigenic properties","viruses","attempt","turkeys","tendency","world","eradication","Vaccination programs","broilers"],"language":"en"},

The associated microbiology remains unclear. Our aim was to determine whether the microbes present in the nasopharynx before an ALRI were associated with its onset. A retrospective case-control/crossover study among Indigenous children aged up to 2 years. ALRI cases identified by medical note review were eligible where nasopharyngeal swabs were available: (1) 0\u201321 days before ALRI onset (case); (2) 90\u2013180 days before ALRI onset (same child controls); and (3) from time and age-matched children without ALRI (different child controls). PCR assays determined the presence and/or load of selected respiratory pathogens. Among 104 children (182 recorded ALRI episodes), 120 case-same child control and 170 case-different child control swab pairs were identified. Human adenoviruses (HAdV) were more prevalent in cases compared to same child controls (18 vs 7%; OR = 3.08, 95% CI 1.22\u20137.76, p = 0.017), but this association was not significant in cases versus different child controls (15 vs 10%; OR = 1.93, 95% CI 0.97\u20133.87 (p = 0.063). No other microbes were more prevalent in cases compared to controls. Streptococcus pneumoniae (74%), Haemophilus influenzae (75%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (88%) were commonly identified across all swabs. In a pediatric population with a high detection rate of nasopharyngeal microbes, HAdV was the only pathogen detected in the period before illness presentation that was significantly associated with ALRI onset. Detection of other potential ALRI pathogens was similar between cases and controls.

The binding of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein to cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the first step in SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, we assayed the inhibitory effects of small peptides derived from S protein on the binding of S protein to ACE2 and on the S-protein-pseudotyped retrovirus infectivity. SP-4 (residues 192\u2013203), SP-8 (residues 483\u2013494), and SP-10 (residues 668\u2013679) significantly blocked the interaction between S protein and ACE2 by biotinylated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with IC50 values of 4.30\u00B12.18, 6.99\u00B10.71, and 1.88\u00B10.52nmol, respectively. Peptide scanning suggested the region spanning residues 660\u2013683 might act as a receptor-binding domain.

In addition to individual factors such as knowledge and education, group factors such as shared perceptions of organizational support for safety may influence adherence. These group safety climate perceptions can differ depending on the pace and type of work, local leadership, and organizational structure of each unit. Methods An analysis of a data set from a cross-sectional survey of 1,074 nurses in 45 units of 6 acute care hospitals was conducted. Variance components analysis was performed to examine the variance in perceptions of safety climate and adherence between units. Hierarchical linear modeling using unit-level safety climate dimensions was conducted to determine if unit-level safety climate dimensions were predictors of nurses\u0027 adherence to FPE. Results Findings revealed statistically significant unit variances in adherence and 5 of the 6 unit-level safety climate dimensions (P \u003C .05). Furthermore, a hierarchical model suggested that tenure and unit-level communication were significantly associated with increased adherence to FPE (P \u003C .05). Conclusion Unit-level safety climate measures varied significantly between units. Strategies to improve unit-level communication regarding safety should assist in improving adherence to FPE.","publish_time":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rozenbojm, Michael Diamant; Nichol, Kathryn; Spielmann, Stephanie; Holness, D.

They are a major contributing factor of disease in industrialized countries, and are responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and a direct annual financial loss of $6-7 billion in North America alone. They are an increasingly challenging health issue due to multidrug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci among others, along with an increasing number of susceptible patients. Over the last three decades, the risk of HCAIs has increased in the radiology department (RD) in part because of an increased number of patients visiting the department and an increase in the utilization of imaging modalities. In this review, we will discuss how patients and staff can be exposed to HCAIs in the RD, including contaminated inanimate surfaces, radiology equipment, and associated medical devices. As the role of medical imaging has extended from primarily diagnosis to include more interventions, the implementation and development of standardized infection minimization protocols and infection control procedures are vital in the RD, particularly in interventional radiology. With globalisation and the rapid movement of people regionally, nationally, and globally, there is greater risk of exposure to contagious diseases such as Ebola, especially if infected patients are undiagnosed when they travel. For effective infection control, advanced training and education of HCWs in the RD is essential. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of HCAIs as related to activities of the RD. We will discuss the following major topics including the variety of HCAIs commonly encountered, the role of the RD in HCAIs, transmission of infections to patients and HCWs in the RD, standard infection prevention measures, and the management of susceptible/infected patients in the RD. We shall also examine the role of, and the preparedness of, HCWs, including RD technologists and interventional radiologists, who may be exposed to undiagnosed, yet infected patients. We shall conclude with a brief discussion of the role of further research related to HCAIs. Learning Objectives After the completion of this review article, the readers will \u2022 Understand the exposure and role of radiology department in health care\u2013associated infections, \u2022 Know the causes/modes/transmission of infections in radiology department, \u2022 Be conscious of standard disinfection protocols, \u2022 Be aware of current and future strategies required for the effective control of health care\u2013associated infection in the radiology department.

We genotyped and analyzed 307 common candidate tagSNPs from 12 antiviral genes in a cohort of 745 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Associations between SNPs/haplotypes and measles virus-specific immune outcomes were assessed using linear regression methodologies in Caucasians and African-Americans. Genetic variants within the DDX58/RIG-I gene, including a coding polymorphism (rs3205166/Val800Val), were associated as single-SNPs (p\u22640.017; although these SNPs did not remain significant after correction for false discovery rate/FDR) and in haplotype-level analysis, with measles-specific antibody variations in Caucasians (haplotype allele p-value=0.021; haplotype global p-value=0.076). Four DDX58 polymorphisms, in high LD, demonstrated also associations (after correction for FDR) with variations in both measles-specific IFN-\u03B3 and IL-2 secretion in Caucasians (p\u22640.001, q=0.193). Two intronic OAS1 polymorphisms, including the functional OAS1 SNP rs10774671 (p=0.003), demonstrated evidence of association with a significant allele-dose-related increase in neutralizing antibody levels in African-Americans. Genotype and haplotype-level associations demonstrated the role of ADAR genetic variants, including a non-synonymous SNP (rs2229857/Arg384Lys; p=0.01), in regulating measles virus-specific IFN-\u03B3 Elispot responses in Caucasians (haplotype global p-value=0.017). After correction FDR, 15 single-SNP associations (11 SNPs in Caucasians and 4 SNPs in African-Americans) still remained significant at the q-value\u003C0.20. In conclusion, our findings strongly point to genetic variants/genes, involved in antiviral sensing and antiviral control, as critical determinants, differentially modulating the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated measles vaccine in Caucasians and African-Americans.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haralambieva, Iana H.; Ovsyannikova, Inna G.; Umlauf, Benjamin J.; Vierkant, Robert A.; Pankratz, V.

The usefulness of existing approaches for re-purposing range from computational modeling to clinical trials. These are often time-consuming, resource intensive, and prone to failure. Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment. The objective would be to also collect for each Covid-19 case the patient\u0027s prior usage of existing therapeutic drugs. These drug usage data would be collected for several major test groups - those who test positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection (using molecular methods) and those who test negative for current infection but also test positive for past infection (using serologic antibody tests). Patients from each of these groups would also be categorized with respect to where they resided on the spectrum of morbidities (from no or mild symptomology to severe). By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression. These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19. Also summarized are some of the numerous attributes, advantages, and limitations of the proposed concept, all pointing to the need for further discussion and evaluation.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daughton, Christian G.","journal":"Global epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e169fcd3d0b5df283ef2703057590403120e244b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427166/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590113320300109?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloepi.2020.100026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590113320300109","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["existing drugs","respect","particular test groups","major test groups","drug usage data","treatment of Covid","patient\u0027s prior usage of existing therapeutic drugs","collection of data","past infection","current infection","distribution of normalized usage data","clinical treatment","fighting Covid","evaluation","proposed concept","re-purposing range","usefulness of existing approaches","clinical trials","simple concept","epidemiological surveillance screening","contraindicated effects","computational modeling","diagnostic testing","novel coronavirus pandemic","limitations","case","on-going natural experiment","serologic antibody tests","active SARS-CoV","resource intensive","advantages","opportunity","disease progression","potential prophylactic","candidates","mild symptomology","failure","numerous attributes","questions","molecular methods","need","prevention","spectrum of morbidities","discussion","future epidemic","Patients","objective"],"language":"en"},

The novel coronavirus caused a pandemic search for information with broad dissemination of false or misleading health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and readability of online information about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was a trending topic on the internet, using validated instruments and relating the quality of information to its readability. METHODS: The search was based on the term \u201CWuhan Coronavirus\u201D on the Google website (February 6, 2020). At the search time, the terms \u201CCOVID-19\u201D or \u201CSARS-CoV-2\u201D (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) did not exist. Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode), the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark, the DISCERN instrument, and Google ranking. RESULTS: The first 110 websites were critically analyzed, and only 1.8% (n=2) of the websites had the HONcode seal. The JAMA benchmark showed that 39.1% (n=43) of the websites did not have any of the categories required by this tool, and only 10.0% (11/110) of the websites had the four quality criteria required by JAMA. The DISCERN score showed that 70.0% (n=77) of the websites were evaluated as having a low score and none were rated as having a high score. CONCLUSIONS: Nonhealth personnel and the scientific community need to be aware about the quality of the information they read and produce, respectively. The Wuhan coronavirus health crisis misinformation was produced by the media, and the misinformation was obtained by users from the internet. The use of the internet has a risk to public health, and, in cases like this, the governments should be developing strategies to regulate health information on the internet without censuring the population.

In the southeast, beef cattle are raised predominantly on forages that may be limiting in nutrients for optimal health, especially trace minerals such as Cu, Zn, and Se. Clinical deficiencies of these nutrients produce classic symptoms that are common to several nutrient deficiencies (e.g., slow growth and unthrifty appearance); however, subclinical deficiencies are more widespread and more difficult to detect, yet may result in broader economic losses. Dietary mineral concentrations often considered adequate for maximum growth, reproductive performance, or optimal immune function have been found to be insufficient at times of physiological stress (weaning, transport, comingling, etc.), when feed intake is reduced. The impacts of these deficiencies on beef cattle health are not apparent until calves have been subjected to these stressors. Health problems that are exacerbated by mineral or vitamin deficiencies include bovine respiratory disease, footrot, retained placenta, metritis, and mastitis. Many micronutrients have antioxidant properties through being components of enzymes and proteins that benefit animal health. In dairy cattle, high levels of supplemental Zn are generally associated with reduced somatic cell counts and improved foot health, possibly reflecting the importance of Zn in maintaining effective epithelial barriers. Neutrophils isolated from ruminants deficient in Cu or Se have reduced ability to kill ingested bacteria in vitro. Supplemental vitamin E, in its role as an intracellular antioxidant has been shown to decrease morbidity in stressed calves. There is more understanding of the important biological role that these nutrients play in the functioning of the complex and multifaceted immune system. However, there is still much to be learned about determining the micronutrient status of herds (and hence when supplementation will be beneficial), requirements for different genetic and environmental conditions, understanding the bioavailability of these nutrients from feedstuffs and forages, quantifying the bioavailability of different supplemental sources of these nutrients, and identifying the impact of dietary antagonists on these nutrients.","publish_time":"2016-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kegley, E.

However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, and various types of respiratory distress syndrome. The respiratory involvement of human coronaviruses has been clearly established since the 1960s. Nevertheless, for almost three decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that, like it was described for other human viruses, coronaviruses have neuroinvasive capacities since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases. Neuroinvasive coronaviruses could damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuroimmunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly induces damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology). Given all these properties, it has been suggested that these opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of neurologic diseases for which the etiology remains poorly understood. Herein, we present host and viral factors that participate in the regulation of the possible pathogenic processes associated with CNS infection by human coronaviruses and we try to decipher the intricate interplay between virus and host target cells in order to characterize their role in the virus life cycle as well as in the capacity of the cell to respond to viral invasion.","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desforges, Marc; Le Coupanec, Alain; Stodola, Jenny K.; Meessen-Pinard, Mathieu; Talbot, Pierre J.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d226f7399ab6f2e1463a5aafd5597f148772549.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114389.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003980; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281913/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory involvement of human coronaviruses","opportunistic human respiratory pathogens","human viruses","various respiratory viruses","lower respiratory tract","upper respiratory tract","human beings","CNS infection","Neuroinvasive coronaviruses","infection of CNS cells","human health problems","opportunistic pathogens","various types of respiratory distress syndrome","virus-induced neuroimmunopathology","host target cells","virus-induced neuropathology","important pathogens","virus life cycle","present host","viral factors","viral replication","viral invasion","damage","immune-compromised individuals","result of misdirected host immune responses","susceptible individuals","neuroinvasive capacities","exacerbation of neurologic diseases","long-term neurological diseases","encephalitis","possible pathogenic processes","regulation","exacerbations of asthma","role","pneumonia","order","central nervous system","neurotropism","intricate interplay","newborns","infants","triggering","autoimmunity","data","Abstract","vulnerable populations","scientific literature","capacity","etiology","common colds","decades","properties"],"language":"en"},

Viruses are the main etiological agents, and their behavior tends to be seasonal and vary by geographical location. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has recently been described as a cause of severe acute respiratory infection and its prevalence and clinical behavior in children at moderate altitudes is unknown. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on patients seen at a university hospital in Bogot\u00E1, Colombia between October 2015 and December 2017 in a city at a moderate altitude above sea level. Children with acute respiratory infections who had had a multiplex RT-PCR assay were selected. The prevalence of HMPV infection, its clinical outcomes and its relationship to rainfall were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of a total of 14,760 discharged patients, multiplex RT-PCR was performed on 502 and a virus was detected in 420 children with acute respiratory infection (ARI). The study group had a median age of 21 months (IQR 7\u201360), with similar proportion of males and females (56.4 and 43.6% respectively) and 5.2% (CI 95 3.3\u20137.8%) prevalence of HMPV infection. The group with HMPV infection showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection (22.7% vs 14% P = 0.03) compared with ARI caused by other viruses. The rate of bacterial coinfection (P = 0.31), presence of comorbidities (p = 0.75), length of hospital stay (P = 0.42), need for mechanical ventilation (P = 0.75) and mortality (P = 0.22) were similar for HMPV and other viral infections. A moderate correlation was established between HMPV infection and rainfall peaks (Spearman\u2019s Rho 0.44 p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Human metapneumovirus was the fifth most frequently isolated virus in children with ARI, had similar clinical behavior and severity to other viruses but a higher rate of viral coinfection. Its peaks seem to correlate to rainy seasons.","publish_time":"2019-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evelyn, Obando; Jaime, Fern\u00E1ndez-Sarmiento; David, Montoya; Lorena, Acevedo; Jenifer, Arroyave; Oscar, Gamboa","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aefd3e6661ed4befc6dd11d15cb80a66e025102e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6785857.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601181/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-019-1734-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":["HMPV"],"locations":["Bogot\u00E1","Colombia"],"keyphrases":["children","prevalence of HMPV infection","Acute respiratory infections","cause of severe acute respiratory infection","similar clinical behavior","viral infections","Viruses","higher rate of viral coinfection","clinical outcomes","moderate altitudes","rainfall peaks","greater frequency of viral coinfection","moderate correlation","rate of bacterial coinfection","study group","mortality","Human metapneumovirus","multiplex RT-PCR assay","similar proportion of males","discharged patients","university hospital","cross-sectional study","length of hospital","isolated virus","main etiological agents","main causes of morbidity","Spearman\u2019s Rho","median age","severity","ARIs","total","BACKGROUND","sea level","months","IQR","Bogot\u00E1","Colombia","females","city","relationship","vs","presence of comorbidities","geographical location","METHODS","rainy seasons","CONCLUSIONS","mechanical ventilation","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We examined inflammatory gene mRNA abundances found in S protein-treated PBMC using gene arrays. We identified differential mRNA abundances of genes with functional properties associated with antiviral (CXCL10) and inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8) responses. We confirmed cytokine mRNA increases by real time quantitative(q) RT-PCR or ELISA. We further analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the prominent IL-8 response. By real time qRT-PCR, S protein was shown to stimulate IL-8 mRNA accumulation in a dose dependent manner while treatment with E protein did not. Also, titration of S protein-specific production and secretion of IL-8 by ELISA showed that the dose of 5.6nM of S produced a significant increase in IL-8 (p=0.003) compared to mock-treated controls. The increase in IL-8 stimulated by a concentration of 5.6 nM of S was comparable to concentrations seen for S protein binding to ACE2 or to neutralizing monoclonal antibody suggesting a physiological relevance. An NF-\u03BAB inhibitor, TPCK (N-Tosyl-L-Phenylalanine Chloromethyl Ketone) could suppress IL-8 production and secretion in response to S protein in PBMC and THP-1 cells and in HCoV-229E virus-infected PBMC. Activation and translocation of NF-\u03BAB was shown to occur rapidly following exposure of PBMC or THP-1 cells to S protein using a highly sensitive assay for active nuclear NF-\u03BAB p65 transcription factor. The results further suggested that released or secreted S protein could activate blood monocytes thru recognition by toll-like receptor (TLR)2 ligand.","publish_time":"2009-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dosch, Susan F.; Mahajan, Supriya D.; Collins, Arlene R.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/383de94872ec5bbd71ffcc6d87494de12b2a049f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ba0da76d9b934ba3fed10ced2e77cd74c972fd2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2699111.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19185596/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170209000124; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170209000124; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2009.01.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S protein binding","secreted S protein","S protein-treated PBMC","nM of S","E protein","secretion of IL","titration of S protein-specific production","prominent IL","mRNA accumulation","inflammatory gene mRNA abundances","cytokine mRNA","NF-\u03BAB inhibitor","following exposure of PBMC","E virus-infected PBMC","THP","differential mRNA abundances of genes","translocation of NF","cells","ELISA","real time qRT-PCR","real time quantitative","active nuclear NF-\u03BAB p65 transcription factor","blood monocytes","gene arrays","significant increase","dose dependent manner","mock-treated controls","human peripheral blood monocyte macrophages","functional properties","sensitive assay","concentrations","N-Tosyl","toll","antiviral","HCoV","TPCK","CXCL10","recognition","effect","treatment","ACE2","monoclonal antibody","Phenylalanine Chloromethyl Ketone","receptor","purified recombinant spike","TLR","physiological relevance","sensitivity","specificity","Activation","ligand","results","responses"],"language":"en"},

In the absence of etiological factors as targets for prevention and therapy, the definition of molecular mechanisms that form the basis of inflammation, demyelination and toxicity for neurons have led to a number of treatments that slow down disease progression in specific patient cohorts, but that do not cure the disease. Current therapies are directed to block the immune processes, both innate and adaptive, that are associated with multiple sclerosis.

First 50 videos in each group were analyzed. Videos in other languages, duplicate videos, those without an audio and duration \u003E15 min were excluded .72 videos in English and 42 in Mandarin were reviewed. 2 reviewers classified the videos as useful, misleading or news based on pre specified criterion. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Modified DISCERN index for reliability and medical information and content index (MICI) score were used for content analysis. Results These videos attracted cumulative 21,288,856 views. 67% of English and 50% Mandarin videos had useful information. The viewership of misleading Mandarin videos was higher than the useful ones. WHO accounted for only 4% of useful videos. Mean DISCERN score for reliability was 3.12/5 and 3.25/5 for English and Mandarin videos respectively. Mean cumulative MICI score of useful videos was low (6.71/25 for English and 6.28/25 for Mandarin). Conclusions YouTube viewership during 2019 n-CoV outbreak is higher than previous outbreaks.

Some potentially important host factors for the antiviral response, whose functions remain largely unexplored, are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here we systematically inferred the regulatory functions of host lncRNAs in response to influenza A virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) based on their similarity in expression with genes of known function. We performed total RNA-Seq on viral-infected lungs from eight mouse strains, yielding a large data set of transcriptional responses. Overall 5,329 lncRNAs were differentially expressed after infection. Most of the lncRNAs were co-expressed with coding genes in modules enriched in genes associated with lung homeostasis pathways or immune response processes. Each lncRNA was further individually annotated using a rank-based method, enabling us to associate 5,295 lncRNAs to at least one gene set and to predict their potential cis effects. We validated the lncRNAs predicted to be interferon-stimulated by profiling mouse responses after interferon-\u03B1 treatment. Altogether, these results provide a broad categorization of potential lncRNA functions and identify subsets of lncRNAs with likely key roles in respiratory virus pathogenesis. These data are fully accessible through the MOuse NOn-Code Lung interactive database (MONOCLdb).","publish_time":"2014-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Josset, Laurence; Tchitchek, Nicolas; Gralinski, Lisa E; Ferris, Martin T; Eisfeld, Amie J; Green, Richard R; Thomas, Matthew J; Tisoncik-Go, Jennifer; Schroth, Gary P; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Baric, Ralph S; Heise, Mark T; Peng, Xinxia; Katze, Michael G","journal":"RNA Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab26f03fd219a3da07426f56fecfcc0a20cb0a4e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/58a37311bfa983a1a720e557ec90c5e91d71b4fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4179962.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4161/rna.29442; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/rna.29442?needAccess=true; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922324/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subsets of lncRNAs","regulatory functions of host lncRNAs","coding genes","respiratory virus pathogenesis","outcome of respiratory virus infection","mouse strains","antiviral response","profiling mouse responses","important host factors","broad categorization of potential lncRNA functions","MOuse NOn-Code Lung interactive database","immune response processes","non-coding RNAs","genes of known function","large data set of transcriptional responses","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lung homeostasis pathways","viral-infected lungs","complex interplay of viral","interferon-\u03B1 treatment","potential cis effects","rank-based method","likely key roles","influenza","SARS-CoV","MONOCLdb","modules","total RNA-Seq","expression","similarity","results"],"language":"en"},

While its use in chemical hazards and its effect on airway management has been assessed previously, there has been no research assessing whether this equipment affects the ability to perform tracheal intubation. It is the intention of this investigation to answer this question. Methods Eighteen workers at various level of training were asked to wear three different types of PPE while performing four different types of tracheal intubation. The PPE used included the eye shield, face shield and the \u201CDustmaster\u2122\u201D. The intubation techniques were direct laryngoscopy, intubation through the intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach\u2122) and flexible bronchoscopy using the eyepiece and an eyepiece with camera attached. We assessed the time to intubate as well as the incidence of oesophageal intubation. A short questionnaire was used to examine participants\u2019 subjective experiences of wearing the various types of PPE. Results There was no significant effect on the time to intubation for any of the methods studied. However, all subjects found that the face shield was uncomfortably hot to wear. Fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation using the eyepiece was particularly difficult with all of the PPE used due to the distance of the subjects\u2019 eye from the eyepiece. Conclusion Although the use of PPE may not affect the length of time to intubate manikins, certain types of PPE may be uncomfortable to wear and noisy. Further research is needed to investigate whether this could be a problem in the clinical setting or in actual difficult intubations.","publish_time":"2007-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greenland, K.

However, there is little qualitative research examining perceptions of infection control measures in the context of pandemic influenza. METHODS: Eight focus groups and one interview were conducted with a purposive sample of 31 participants. Participants were invited to discuss their perceptions of infection transmission and likely adherence to infection control measures in both non-pandemic and pandemic contexts. Infection control measures discussed included handwashing, social distancing and cough hygiene (e.g. covering mouth, disposing of tissues immediately etc.). RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed that although participants were knowledgeable about infection transmission, most expressed unfavourable attitudes toward control behaviours in non-pandemic situations. However, with the provision of adequate education about control measures and appropriate practical support (e.g. memory aids, access to facilities), most individuals report that they are likely to adhere to infection control protocols in the event of a pandemic. Of the behaviours likely to influence infection transmission, handwashing was regarded by our participants as more feasible than cough and sneeze hygiene and more acceptable than social distancing. CONCLUSION: Handwashing could prove a useful target for health promotion, but interventions to promote infection control may need to address a number of factors identified within this study as potential barriers to carrying out infection control behaviours.","publish_time":"2009-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morrison, Leanne G; Yardley, Lucy","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9a61ae749c3d53492b38119c9fbe5f0e448b52a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2720966.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19627568/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-258","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection control behaviours","infection control protocols","perceptions of infection control measures","perceptions of infection transmission","participants","behaviours likely","pandemic contexts","non-pandemic situations","context of pandemic influenza","cough hygiene","included handwashing","likely adherence","social distancing","sneeze hygiene","health promotion","future health threat","appropriate practical support","expressed unfavourable attitudes","memory aids","access","useful target","provision of adequate education","little qualitative research","potential barriers","interventions","interview","study","facilities","event","Thematic analysis","important defence","focus groups","number of factors","individuals","purposive sample","mouth","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","tissues"],"language":"en"},

RNA interference (RNAi) has been used as a powerful tool to silence genes in cells and animals. In this study, we developed a small interfering RNA generation system that expressed two different siRNAs to target the HBs gene of HBV and the gp120 gene of HIV in Bel-7402 and HEK293T cells, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the two siRNA molecules could simultaneously inhibit the expression of HBs and gp120 by 81% and 89%, respectively.

To improve the immune response, an adjuvant consisting of plasmid encoding either porcine interleukin (IL)-12 or IFN-\u03B1 was co-administered during vaccination. In the presence of either adjuvant, at least a three-fold increase in the primary virus-specific IFN-\u03B3 response was observed. While this enhancement was only transient (1 week) when the IL-12 expressing plasmid was used, the effect was not only still apparent at 6 weeks after vaccination in the presence of the IFN-\u03B1 expressing plasmid but even after challenge with a virulent genetically divergent PRRSV. In contrast, no effect of either adjuvant on the production of anti-virus antibodies was noticed throughout the study. Despite the apparent augmentation of a T helper (Th) 1 type response by the inclusion of IFN-\u03B1 or IL-12 during vaccination, this modulation did not necessarily correlate with a reduction in viremia. Since a similar increase in the degree of the IFN-\u03B3 response to the PRRSV vaccine could be achieved by substituting polyinosinic\u2013polycytidylic acid in lieu of either cytokine, exposure to PRRSV in the presence of a variety of Th 1 polarizing molecules can positively influence the development of the cell-mediated immune response of swine to this pathogen. Conceivably, such intervention could be applied to improve the formulation of anti-PRRSV vaccines.","publish_time":"2004-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meier, William A.; Husmann, Robert J.; Schnitzlein, William M.; Osorio, Fernando A.; Lunney, Joan K.; Zuckermann, Federico A.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/093309770e603a5442c83ed4c32bc911d7f86577.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112576.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704002636; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704002636","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1","inclusion of IFN","type response","primary virus-specific IFN-\u03B3 response","divergent PRRSV","immune response of swine","adjuvant","vaccination","plasmid","presence","formulation of anti-PRRSV vaccines","effect","production of anti-virus antibodies","respiratory syndrome virus","variety of Th","porcine interleukin","fold increase","apparent augmentation","similar increase","T helper","cytokine","exposure","challenge","degree","weak interferon","Abstract Immunization of pigs","polycytidylic acid","development","polarizing molecules","polyinosinic","cell","pathogen","weeks","enhancement","study","contrast","reduction","viremia","modulation","intervention"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comprising 579 children age 18 to 72 months with a previous history of physician-diagnosed RTI, recruited between 2003 and 2005. The children were assigned to 2 doses of parenteral inactivated trivalent subunit influenza plus heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (TIV\u002BPCV7), influenza plus placebo vaccination (TIV\u002Bplac), or control hepatitis B virus vaccination plus placebo (HBV\u002Bplac). Main outcome measures were febrile RTI and related polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed influenza, primary care visits, antibiotic prescriptions, and acute otitis media (AOM) episodes. RESULTS: During influenza seasons, febrile RTI were reduced by 24% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1% to 42%) in the TIV\u002BPCV7 group and by 13% (95% CI = -12% to 32%) in the TIV\u002Bplac group compared with the control group.

In this study, we demonstrated that DOX damaged mitochondrial morphology and induced the co-localization of mitochondria with autophagosomes, suggesting that DOX induces mitophagy in IPEC-J2 cells. We also found evidence that DOX increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or mitochondrial-specific ROS in a dose dependent manner.

Primers were designed from conserved or variable regions of nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) protein gene among TCoV, IBV, and BCoV and used in the same PCR reaction. Reverse transcription followed by the PCR reaction was used to amplify a portion of N or S gene of the corresponding coronaviruses. The PCR products were detected on agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Two PCR products, a 356-bp band corresponding to N gene and a 727-bp band corresponding to S gene, were obtained for TCoV isolates. In contrast, one PCR product of 356bp corresponding to a fragment of N gene was obtained for IBV strains and one PCR product of 568bp corresponding to a fragment of S gene was obtained for BCoV. There were no PCR products with the same primers for Newcastle disease virus, Marek\u0027s disease virus, turkey pox virus, pigeon pox virus, fowl pox virus, reovirus, infectious bursal disease virus, enterovirus, astrovirus, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum.

In a screen based on a yeast three-hybrid system using the 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA as bait against a human cDNA library derived from HeLa cells, we found a positive candidate cellular protein, zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif 1 (MADP1), to be able to interact with this region of the SARS-CoV genome. This interaction was subsequently confirmed in coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The specificity of the interaction between MADP1 and the 5\u2032-UTR of IBV was investigated and confirmed by using an RNA pull-down assay. The RNA-binding domain was mapped to the N-terminal region of MADP1 and the protein binding sequence to stem\u2013loop I of IBV 5\u2032-UTR. MADP1 was found to be translocated to the cytoplasm and partially co-localized with the viral replicase/transcriptase complexes (RTCs) in IBV-infected cells, deviating from its usual nuclear localization in a normal cell using indirect immunofluorescence. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) against MADP1, defective viral RNA synthesis was observed in the knockdown cells, therefore indicating the importance of the protein in coronaviral RNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2012-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Yong Wah; Hong, Wanjin; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cd8c3706551ab124d7035449350556c72297e2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3367200.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22362731/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA-binding motif","coronaviral RNA synthesis","RNA-binding domain","Coronaviruses RNA synthesis","defective viral RNA synthesis","UTR of IBV","small interfering RNA","RNA pull-down assay","IBV-infected cells","SARS coronavirus","N-terminal region of MADP1","protein binding sequence","HeLa cells","knockdown cells","SARS-CoV genome","cytoplasm","untranslated region","interaction","positive candidate cellular protein","viral replicase","normal cell","host cell proteins","coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","zinc finger CCHC-type","RTCs","bait","siRNA","human cDNA library","transcriptase complexes","usual nuclear localization","importance","indirect immunofluorescence","yeast","hybrid system","specificity","screen"],"language":"en"},

As a result of ineffective initial control efforts, an Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scale emerged. As of 4 May 2015, it had resulted in more than 19,000 probable and confirmed Ebola cases, mainly in Guinea (3,529), Liberia (5,343), and Sierra Leone (10,746). Here, we present analyses of data collected during the outbreak identifying drivers of transmission and highlighting areas where control could be improved. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Over 19,000 confirmed and probable Ebola cases were reported in West Africa by 4 May 2015. Individuals with confirmed or probable Ebola (\u201Ccases\u201D) were asked if they had exposure to other potential Ebola cases (\u201Cpotential source contacts\u201D) in a funeral or non-funeral context prior to becoming ill. We performed retrospective analyses of a case line-list, collated from national databases of case investigation forms that have been reported to WHO. These analyses were initially performed to assist WHO\u2019s response during the epidemic, and have been updated for publication. We analysed data from 3,529 cases in Guinea, 5,343 in Liberia, and 10,746 in Sierra Leone; exposures were reported by 33% of cases. The proportion of cases reporting a funeral exposure decreased over time. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.35, p \u003C 0.001) between this proportion in a given district for a given month and the within-district transmission intensity, quantified by the estimated reproduction number (R). We also found a negative correlation (r = \u22120.37, p \u003C 0.001) between R and the district proportion of hospitalised cases admitted within \u22644 days of symptom onset. These two proportions were not correlated, suggesting that reduced funeral attendance and faster hospitalisation independently influenced local transmission intensity. We were able to identify 14% of potential source contacts as cases in the case line-list. Linking cases to the contacts who potentially infected them provided information on the transmission network. This revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in inferred transmissions, with only 20% of cases accounting for at least 73% of new infections, a phenomenon often called super-spreading. Multivariable regression models allowed us to identify predictors of being named as a potential source contact. These were similar for funeral and non-funeral contacts: severe symptoms, death, non-hospitalisation, older age, and travelling prior to symptom onset. Non-funeral exposures were strongly peaked around the death of the contact. There was evidence that hospitalisation reduced but did not eliminate onward exposures. We found that Ebola treatment units were better than other health care facilities at preventing exposure from hospitalised and deceased individuals. The principal limitation of our analysis is limited data quality, with cases not being entered into the database, cases not reporting exposures, or data being entered incorrectly (especially dates, and possible misclassifications). CONCLUSIONS: Achieving elimination of Ebola is challenging, partly because of super-spreading. Safe funeral practices and fast hospitalisation contributed to the containment of this Ebola epidemic. Continued real-time data capture, reporting, and analysis are vital to track transmission patterns, inform resource deployment, and thus hasten and maintain elimination of the virus from the human population.","publish_time":"2016-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agua-Agum, Junerlyn; Ariyarajah, Archchun; Aylward, Bruce; Bawo, Luke; Bilivogui, Pepe; Blake, Isobel M.; Brennan, Richard J.; Cawthorne, Amy; Cleary, Eilish; Clement, Peter; Conteh, Roland; Cori, Anne; Dafae, Foday; Dahl, Benjamin; Dangou, Jean-Marie; Diallo, Boubacar; Donnelly, Christl A.; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Dye, Christopher; Eckmanns, Tim; Fallah, Mosoka; Ferguson, Neil M.; Fiebig, Lena; Fraser, Christophe; Garske, Tini; Gonzalez, Lice; Hamblion, Esther; Hamid, Nuha; Hersey, Sara; Hinsley, Wes; Jambei, Amara; Jombart, Thibaut; Kargbo, David; Keita, Sakoba; Kinzer, Michael; George, Fred Kuti; Godefroy, Beatrice; Gutierrez, Giovanna; Kannangarage, Niluka; Mills, Harriet L.; Moller, Thomas; Meijers, Sascha; Mohamed, Yasmine; Morgan, Oliver; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Newton, Emily; Nouvellet, Pierre; Nyenswah, Tolbert; Perea, William; Perkins, Devin; Riley, Steven; Rodier, Guenael; Rondy, Marc; Sagrado, Maria; Savulescu, Camelia; Schafer, Ilana J.; Schumacher, Dirk; Seyler, Thomas; Shah, Anita; Van Kerkhove, Maria D.; Wesseh, C.

Non-invasive ventilation is now considered first-line intervention for different causes of acute respiratory failure and may be considered in the context of H1N1 pandemic. Although infection control issues have been arisen, non-invasive ventilation was effective and safe during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. It is reasonable to recommend non-invasive ventilation in H1N1-related exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, especially in negative-pressure wards. Treatment of early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with H1N1 using non-invasive ventilation could be tried rapidly identifying those who fail without delaying endotracheal intubation.

PHEV shares the same genomic organization, replication strategy, and expression of viral proteins as other nidoviruses. PHEV produces vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or encephalomyelitis, being the only known neurotropic coronavirus affecting pigs. First clinical outbreak was reported in 1957 in Ontario, Canada. Although pigs are the only species susceptible to natural PHEV infections, the virus displays neurotropism in mice and Wistar rats. Clinical disease, morbidity, and mortality is age-dependent and generally reported only in piglets under 4 weeks old. The primary site of replication of PHEV in pigs is the respiratory tract, and it can be further spread to the central nervous system through the peripheral nervous system via different pathways. The diagnosis of PHEV can be made using a combination of direct and indirect detection methods. The virus can be isolated from different tissues within the acute phase of the clinical signs using primary and secondary pig-derived cell lines. PHEV agglutinates the erythrocytes of mice, rats, chickens, and several other animals. PCR-based methods are useful to identify and subsequently isolate animals that are actively shedding the virus. The ability to detect antibodies allows producers to know the status of first-litter gilts and evaluate their risk of tier offspring to infection. PHEV is highly prevalent and circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide. PHEV-related disease is not clinically relevant in most of the swine-producing countries, most likely because of dams are immune to PHEV which may confer passive immunity to their offspring. However, PHEV should be considered a major source of economic loss because of the high mortality on farms with high gilt replacement rates, specific pathogen-free animals, and gnotobiotic swine herds. Thus, in the absence of current PHEV vaccines, promoting virus circulation on farms with early exposure to gilts and young sows could induce maternal immunity and prevent disease in piglets.","publish_time":"2019-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mora-D\u00EDaz, Juan Carlos; Pi\u00F1eyro, Pablo Enrique; Houston, Elizabeth; Zimmerman, Jeffrey; Gim\u00E9nez-Lirola, Luis Gabriel","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2563d232b59f44a5431f582cdc965b3de048e8dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6402421.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of PHEV","PHEV-related disease","natural PHEV infections","absence of current PHEV vaccines","Clinical disease","virus circulation","pigs","porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","high mortality","farms","clinical signs","isolate animals","gnotobiotic swine herds","clinical outbreak","piglets","peripheral nervous system","central nervous system","primary site of replication","family Coronaviridae","specific pathogen-free animals","replication strategy","maternal immunity","litter gilts","different pathways","different tissues","passive immunity","erythrocytes of mice","Wistar rats","sub-family Cornavirinae","indirect detection methods","risk of tier offspring","PCR-based methods","high gilt replacement rates","early exposure","young sows","neurotropism","secondary pig-derived cell lines","acute phase","member of genus Betacoronavirus","expression of viral proteins","major source of economic loss","species susceptible","combination of direct","genomic organization","status","order Nidovirales","dams","chickens","morbidity","antibodies","producers","nidoviruses","age-dependent","countries","VWD","respiratory tract","vomiting","neurotropic coronavirus","Ontario","ability","weeks old","Canada"],"language":"en"},

The introductory coronavirus disease (COVID\u201119) course was launched on January 26, 2020, on the health emergencies learning platform OpenWHO.org. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to investigate the geographic reach of different language courses accessed by a worldwide audience seeking information on COVID-19. Users\u2019 professional identities and backgrounds were explored to inform course owners on the use case. The course was developed and delivered via the open-access learning platform OpenWHO.org. The self-paced resources are available in a total of 13 languages and were produced between January 26 and March 25, 2020. METHODS: Data were collected from the online courses\u2019 statistical data and metrics reporting system on the OpenWHO platform. User patterns and locations were analyzed based on Google Analytics and the platform\u2019s own statistics capabilities, and data sets were overlaid. This analysis was conducted based on user location, with the data disaggregated according to the six WHO regions, the top 10 countries, and the proportion of use for each language version. Data included affiliation, gender, age, and other parameters for 32.43% (52,214/161,007) of the users who indicated their background. RESULTS: As of March 25, 2020, the introductory COVID-19 course totaled 232,890 enrollments across all languages. The Spanish language course was comprised of more than half (n=118,754, 50.99%) of all course enrollments, and the English language course was comprised of 38.21% (n=88,988) of enrollments. The WHO\u2019s Region of the Americas accounted for most of the course enrollments, with more than 72.47% (138,503/191,130) enrollment across all languages. Other regions were more evenly distributed with less than 10% enrollment for each. A total of 32.43% (52,214/161,007) of users specified a professional affiliation by choosing from the 12 most common backgrounds in the OpenWHO user profiles. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, users were spread over the 11 distinct affiliations, with a small fraction of users identifying themselves as \u201COther.\u201D With the COVID-19 introductory course, the largest number of users selected \u201COther\u201D (16,527/52,214, 31.65%), suggesting a large number of users who were not health professionals or academics. The top 10 countries with the most users across all languages were Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Mexico, Peru, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The online course has addressed a worldwide learning need by providing WHO\u2019s technical guidance packaged in simple formats for access and use. The learning material development was expedited to meet the onset of the epidemic. Initial data suggest that the various language versions of the course, in particular Spanish, have reached new user groups, fulfilling the platform\u2019s aim of providing learning everywhere to anyone that is interested. User surveys will be carried out to measure the real impact.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Utunen, Heini; Ndiaye, Ngouille; Piroux, Corentin; George, Richelle; Attias, Melissa; Gamhewage, Gaya","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293580/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19076","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Health Emergencies Learning and Capacity Development Unit","OpenWHO.org"],"locations":["Americas","Argentina","Chile","Colombia","Ecuador","India","Mexico","Peru","United Kingdom","United States","Spain"],"keyphrases":["course enrollments","introductory course","course owners","Spanish language course","English language course","massive open online course","Health Emergencies Learning","introductory COVID","languages","data sets","Initial data","largest number of users","large number of users","open-access learning platform","health professionals","worldwide learning need","learning material development","user location","User patterns","small fraction of users","User surveys","WHO\u2019s health technical lead","online courses\u2019 statistical data","OpenWHO user profiles","OpenWHO platform","World Health Organization\u2019s","various language versions","new user groups","platform\u2019s aim","proportion of use","introductory coronavirus disease","use case","WHO\u2019s Region","onset","professional affiliation","total","countries","regions","geographic reach of different language courses","technical guidance","worldwide audience","United Kingdom","common backgrounds","coronavirus outbreak","particular Spanish","United States","Capacity Development Unit","Users\u2019 professional identities","metrics","coronaviruses","India","Ecuador","Peru","Colombia","system","weeks","self-paced resources","statistics capabilities","Mexico","Spain","Chile","simple formats","Argentina","OBJECTIVE","Google Analytics","paper","locations","gender","distinct affiliations","global response","information","Americas","emergency","parameters","analysis","academics","half","CONCLUSIONS","pandemic","real impact","epidemic","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It is abundant in milk and in most biological fluids and is a cell-secreted molecule that bridges innate and adaptive immune function in mammals. Its protective effects range from anticancer, anti-inflammatory and immune modulator activities to antimicrobial activities against a large number of microorganisms. This wide range of activities is made possible by mechanisms of action involving not only the capacity of Lf to bind iron but also interactions of Lf with molecular and cellular components of both hosts and pathogens. Scope of review This review summarizes the activities of Lf, its regulation and potential applications. Major conclusions The extensive uses of Lf in the treatment of various infectious diseases in animals and humans has been the driving force in Lf research however, a lot of work is required to obtain a better understanding of its activity. General significance The large potential applications of Lf have led scientists to develop this nutraceutical protein for use in feed, food and pharmaceutical applications.

However, the role of the recently described respiratory viruses is not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to estimate the frequency of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and 14 other respiratory viruses in hospitalized children with acute wheezing. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on children \u003C14 years old, admitted with an acute expiratory wheezing episode from September 2005 to June 2008. Viruses were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates by polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were prospectively recorded. RESULTS: A viral pathogen was identified in 444 (71%) out of 626 hospitalized acute wheezing episodes. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected (27%), followed by rhinovirus (24%), adenovirus (17.8%), HBoV (16%), and HMPV (4.7%). The rate of viral detection was significantly higher in infants (77.3%), than in older children (59.8%) (P \u003C 0.001). RSV and HBoV were more prevalent in infants (P \u003C 0.001) than in older children. CONCLUSION: The most prevalent viruses found in severe acute wheezing episodes were RSV and rhinovirus not only in childhood, but also in infancy. However, other emerging viruses such as HBoV and metapneumovirus also play an important role in wheezing episodes.

The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002\u20132003 epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases. Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their transmissibility. It is likely that these differences in infectivity of coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

Autophagy is now recognized to restrict viral infections and replication of intracellular bacteria and parasites. Additionally, this pathway delivers cytoplasmic antigens for MHC class II presentation to the adaptive immune system, which then in turn is able to regulate autophagy. At the same time, autophagy plays a role in the survival and the cell death of T cells. Thus, the immune system utilizes autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic material, to both restrict intracellular pathogens and regulate adaptive immunity.","publish_time":"2007-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schmid, Dorothee; M\u00FCnz, Christian","journal":"Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e742d5539ebb5debe6fd03daf8f3e0ecdd51f03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118777.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761307003408; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761307003408","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["importance of autophagy","intracellular material","adaptive immunity","adaptive immune system","intracellular pathogens","cell survival","autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic material","replication of intracellular bacteria","proteasomal degradation","cytoplasmic antigens","cell death of T cells","essential role","main proteolytic machineries of eukaryotic cells","presentation","MHC class","proteasomes","lysosomes","viral infections","Polyubiquitination targets proteins","substrates","pathway","turn","lysosomal hydrolysis","different routes","parasites","time"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: BMECs of the two groups were successfully isolated and identified. No significant differences were noticed in BMECs proliferation between the two groups. However, compared to the control, cell viability, tube formation, and migration of BMECs were significantly decreased and the number of TUNEL positive cells was markedly increased in the ONFH group. In the ONFH group, it was also noted that the amount of Bax and cleaved-caspase3 was elevated while that of Bcl-2 was reduced.

We have previously demonstrated that curcumin-loaded polyvinylpyrrolidone nanoparticles (CURN) improve the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of curcumin in hepatocytes. In this study, we focused on the effects of CURN on the expression of ICAM-1 in TNF-\u03B1-treated lung epithelial cells and compared these to the effects of curcumin water preparation (CURH). TNF-\u03B1induced ICAM-1 expression, ROS production, and cell-cell adhesion were significantly attenuated by the pretreatment with antioxidants (DPI, APO, or NAC) and CURN, but not by CURH, as revealed by western blot analysis, RT-PCR, promoter assay, and ROS detection and adhesion assay. In addition, treatment of TNF-\u03B1-treated cells with CURN and antioxidants also resulted in an inhibition of activation of p47 (phox) and phosphorylation of MAPKs, as compared to that using CURH. Our findings also suggest that phosphorylation of MAPKs may eventually lead to the activation of transcription factors. We also observed that the effects of TNF-\u03B1 treatment for 30 min, which includes a significant increase in the binding activity of AP-1 and phosphorylation of c-jun and c-fos genes, were reduced by CURN treatment. In vivo studies have revealed that CURN improved the anti-inflammation activities of CURH in the lung epithelial cells of TNF-\u03B1-treated mice.

Despite significant advances in in silico design and structure-based assembly, most engineered NPs are refractory to soluble expression and fail to assemble as designed, presenting major challenges in the manufacturing process. The failure is due to a lack of understanding of the kinetic pathways and enabling technical platforms to ensure successful folding of the monomer antigens into regular assemblages. Capitalizing on a novel function of RNA as a molecular chaperone (chaperna: chaperone \u002B RNA), we provide a robust protein-folding vehicle that may be implemented to NP assembly in bacterial hosts. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was fused with the RNA-interaction domain (RID) and bacterioferritin, and expressed in Escherichia coli in a soluble form. Site-specific proteolytic removal of the RID prompted the assemblage of monomers into NPs, which was confirmed by electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The mutations that affected the RNA binding to RBD significantly increased the soluble aggregation into amorphous structures, reducing the overall yield of NPs of a defined size. This underscored the RNA-antigen interactions during NP assembly. The sera after mouse immunization effectively interfered with the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to the cellular receptor hDPP4. The results suggest that RNA-binding controls the overall kinetic network of the antigen folding pathway in favor of enhanced assemblage of NPs into highly regular and immunologically relevant conformations. The concentration of the ion Fe(2\u002B), salt, and fusion linker also contributed to the assembly in vitro, and the stability of the NPs. The kinetic \u201Cpace-keeping\u201D role of chaperna in the super molecular assembly of antigen monomers holds promise for the development and delivery of NPs and virus-like particles as recombinant vaccines and for serological detection of viral infections.","publish_time":"2018-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Young-Seok; Son, Ahyun; Kim, Jihoon; Kwon, Soon Bin; Kim, Myung Hee; Kim, Paul; Kim, Jieun; Byun, Young Ho; Sung, Jemin; Lee, Jinhee; Yu, Ji Eun; Park, Chan; Kim, Yeon-Sook; Cho, Nam-Hyuk; Chang, Jun; Seong, Baik L.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56964b8cbc98f8dd9a1a45190f0daceb59c62df9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5966535.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29868035/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["RNA binding","RNA-binding","NP assembly","subsequent assembly","engineered NPs","delivery of NPs","RNA-antigen interactions","binding of MERS","overall yield of NPs","RNA-interaction domain","super molecular assembly of antigen monomers","structure-based assembly","receptor-binding domain","novel function of RNA","CoV RBD","favor of enhanced assemblage of NPs","successful folding","folding of monomeric antigens","molecular chaperone","MERS-CoV","overall kinetic network","kinetic pathways","assemblage of monomers","soluble expression","soluble aggregation","robust protein-folding vehicle","soluble form","recombinant vaccines","amorphous structures","monomer antigens","role of chaperna","regular assemblages","higher ordered structures","cellular receptor hDPP4","Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","silico design","effective production of nanoparticle","bacterioferritin","particles","technical platforms","development","serological detection of viral infections","electron microscopy","dynamic light scattering","Escherichia coli","significant advances","lack of understanding","defined size","Site-specific proteolytic removal","major challenges","manufacturing process","salt","reproducible manner","mouse immunization","fusion linker","pace","bacterial hosts","ion Fe","relevant conformations","concentration","sera","mutations","results","stability","failure"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 0.59- and 2.1-mg FA intravitreal implant in patients with noninfectious posterior uveitis. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, dose-controlled study was performed. Patients were randomized to the 0.59- or 2.1-mg FA implant surgically placed in the vitreous cavity through a pars plana incision and were evaluated at visits through 3 years. Patients with bilateral disease had the more severely affected eye implanted. Outcomes included uveitis recurrence rate, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), use of adjunctive therapy, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 239 patients, predominantly Asian, were implanted (n = 117, 0.59-mg implant; n = 122, 2.1-mg implant). Approximately 80% of patients had bilateral disease. Recurrence rates for implanted eyes decreased from 42.3% during the 1-year pre-implantation period to 25.9% during the 3-year post-implantation period (P = 0.0003) and increased for nonimplanted fellow eyes from 19.8 to 59.7% (P \u003C 0.0001). More implanted eyes gained \u22653 lines of BCVA compared to nonimplanted fellow eyes (P \u2264 0.0046); and implanted eyes required less adjunctive systemic therapy and fewer periocular injections (P \u003C 0.0001). Elevations of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mm Hg) were frequent in implanted eyes (67.8%, 0.59-mg implant; 71.3%, 2.1-mg implant); nearly all (94.9%) phakic implanted eyes required cataract surgery. CONCLUSION: The FA intravitreal implant significantly reduced uveitis recurrence rates and led to improvements in visual acuity and reductions in adjunctive therapy.

We have examined this directly by a comparative RNA-Seq analysis of KBM-7 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and KBM-7 cells in which the NUDT2 Ap(4)A hydrolase gene had been disrupted (NuKO cells), causing a 175-fold increase in intracellular Ap(4)A. 6,288 differentially expressed genes were identified with P \u003C 0.05. Of these, 980 were up-regulated and 705 down-regulated in NuKO cells with a fold-change \u2265 2. Ingenuity(\u00AE) Pathway Analysis (IPA(\u00AE)) was used to assign these genes to known canonical pathways and functional networks. Pathways associated with interferon responses, pattern recognition receptors and inflammation scored highly in the down-regulated set of genes while functions associated with MHC class II antigens were prominent among the up-regulated genes, which otherwise showed little organization into major functional gene sets. Tryptophan catabolism was also strongly down-regulated as were numerous genes known to be involved in tumor promotion in other systems, with roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Conversely, some pro-apoptotic genes were up-regulated. Major upstream factors predicted by IPA(\u00AE) for gene down-regulation included NF\u03BAB, STAT1/2, IRF3/4 and SP1 but no major factors controlling gene up-regulation were identified. Potential mechanisms for gene regulation mediated by Ap(4)A and/or NUDT2 disruption include binding of Ap(4)A to the HINT1 co-repressor, autocrine activation of purinoceptors by Ap(4)A, chromatin remodeling, effects of NUDT2 loss on transcript stability, and inhibition of ATP-dependent regulatory factors such as protein kinases by Ap(4)A. Existing evidence favors the last of these as the most probable mechanism. Regardless, our results suggest that the NUDT2 protein could be a novel cancer chemotherapeutic target, with its inhibition potentially exerting strong anti-tumor effects via multiple pathways involving metastasis, invasion, immunosuppression and apoptosis.","publish_time":"2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marriott, Andrew S.; Vasieva, Olga; Fang, Yongxiang; Copeland, Nikki A.; McLennan, Alexander G.; Jones, Nigel J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ceab18d97f09ef0d9030f0c808f7ab5ab1c7d583.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4856261.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0154674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27144453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pathway Analysis","MHC","IPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulated genes","NUDT2 Ap","gene regulation","regulated set of genes","intracellular Ap","binding of Ap","Regulation of gene expression","hydrolase gene","numerous genes","NUDT2 protein","major factors","major functional gene sets","NuKO cells","pro-apoptotic genes","NUDT2 disruption","effects of NUDT2 loss","Major upstream factors","multiple pathways","metastasis","canonical pathways","roles","invasion","IPA","chronic myelogenous leukemia cells","dependent regulatory factors","inhibition of ATP","strong anti-tumor effects","protein kinases","tumor promotion","Pathway Analysis","functional networks","fold increase","fold-change","comparative RNA-Seq analysis of KBM","little organization","transcript stability","functions","autocrine activation of purinoceptors","interferon responses","pattern recognition receptors","epithelial-mesenchymal transition","stress-induced nucleotide diadenosine tetraphosphate","proliferation","MHC class","novel cancer chemotherapeutic target","HINT1 co-repressor","chromatin remodeling","inflammation","antigens","systems","immunosuppression","NF\u03BAB","SP1","Potential mechanisms","IRF3","STAT1","apoptosis","Ingenuity","Existing evidence","results","Tryptophan catabolism","probable mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant fragments of a rabbit coronavirus (RbCoV-HKU14) were identified at the hemagglutinin esterase gene position. Homolog fragments of a rodent CoV were also observed at 8.9-kDa open reading frame 4a at the 3\u2032 end of the spike gene.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a penchant for sudden emergence, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and most recently, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Small animal models of emerging viral pathogenesis are crucial to better understand the virus and host factors driving disease progression. However, rodent models are often criticized for their limited translatability to humans. The complete blood count is the most ordered clinical test in the United States serving as the cornerstone of clinical medicine and differential diagnosis. We recently generated a mouse model for MERS-CoV pathogenesis through the humanization of the orthologous entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). To increase the translatability of this model, we validated and established the use of an automated veterinary hematology analyzer (VetScan HM5) at biosafety level 3 for analysis of peripheral blood. MERS-CoV lung titer peaked 2 days post infection concurrent with lymphopenia and neutrophilia in peripheral blood, two phenomena also observed in MERS-CoV infection of humans. The fluctuations in leukocyte populations measured by Vetscan HM5 were corroborated by standard flow cytometry, thus confirming the utility of this approach. Comparing a sublethal and lethal dose of MERS-CoV in mice, analysis of daily blood draws demonstrates a dose dependent modulation of leukocytes. Major leukocyte populations were modulated before weight loss was observed. Importantly, neutrophil counts on 1dpi were predictive of disease severity with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV highlighting the predictive value of hematology in this model. Taken together, the inclusion of hematological measures in mouse models of emerging viral pathogenesis increases their translatability and should elevate the preclinical evaluation of MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines to better mirror the complexity of the human condition.","publish_time":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leist, Sarah R.; Jensen, Kara L.; Baric, Ralph S.; Sheahan, Timothy P.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c66b53fa3a31eb9fcc20c56830c89061b7caed49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6655769.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339932/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220126","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","United States"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV pathogenesis","SARS-CoV","CoV therapeutics","SADS-CoV","MERS-CoV infection of humans","MERS-CoV lung titer","lethal dose of MERS","Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","preclinical evaluation of MERS","mouse models of emerging viral pathogenesis","analysis of peripheral blood","Small animal models of emerging viral pathogenesis","emerging viral pathogens","VetScan HM5","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","analysis of daily blood draws","complete blood count","rodent models","limited translatability","swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus","predictive value of hematology","predictive of disease severity","Major leukocyte populations","dose dependent modulation of leukocytes","better mirror","animal health","human condition","disease progression","ordered clinical test","cornerstone of clinical medicine","days post infection concurrent","automated veterinary hematology analyzer","neutrophilia","lymphopenia","humanization","mice","unpredictable threat","orthologous entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase","biosafety level","vaccines","United States","complexity","inclusion of hematological measures","phenomena","standard flow cytometry","penchant","DPP4","sudden emergence","host factors","differential diagnosis","weight loss","CoVs","utility","fluctuations","sublethal","Coronaviruses","neutrophil counts","approach"],"language":"en"},

The particular characteristics of one of the most potent compounds in this series (5-[[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-isoxazolyl]methyl]-2-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-5H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine or GS-327073), were studied. Methods Antiviral activity of GS-327073 was evaluated in HCV subgenomic replicons (genotypes 1b, 1a and 2a), in the JFH1 (genotype 2a) infectious system and against replicons resistant to various selective HCV inhibitors. Combination studies of GS-327073 with other selective HCV inhibitors were performed. Results Fifty percent effective concentrations for inhibition of HCV subgenomic 1b replicon replication ranged between 2 and 50nM and were 100-fold higher for HCV genotype 2a virus. The 50% cytostatic concentrations were \u2A7E17\u03BCM, thus resulting in selectivity indices of \u2A7E340. GS-327073 retained wild-type activity against HCV replicons that were resistant to either HCV protease inhibitors or several polymerase inhibitors. GS-327073, when combined with either interferon \u03B1, ribavirin, a nucleoside polymerase or a protease inhibitor resulted in overall additive antiviral activity. Combinations containing GS-327073 proved highly effective in clearing hepatoma cells from HCV. Conclusions GS-327073 is a potent in vitro inhibitor of HCV replication either alone or in combination with other selective HCV inhibitors.","publish_time":"2009-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vliegen, Inge; Paeshuyse, Jan; De Burghgraeve, Tine; Lehman, Laura S.; Paulson, Matthew; Shih, I-Hung; Mabery, Eric; Boddeker, Nina; De Clercq, Erik; Reiser, Hans; Oare, David; Lee, William A.; Zhong, Weidong; Bondy, Steven; P\u00FCrstinger, Gerhard; Neyts, Johan","journal":"Journal of Hepatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e5360d3283ac39f7a943482183c90dc00bdfa9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114863.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19303654/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827809000798; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2008.12.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168827809000798","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV replicons","HCV genotype","HCV protease inhibitors","various selective HCV inhibitors","HCV subgenomic replicons","inhibitor of HCV replication","selective inhibitors of","inhibition of HCV subgenomic","polymerase inhibitors","Conclusions GS","Combination studies of GS","Methods Antiviral activity of GS","replicons resistant","b replicon replication","potent compounds","additive antiviral activity","percent effective concentrations","wild-type activity","nucleoside polymerase","cytostatic concentrations","infectious system","set of substituted imidazopyridines","lead optimization","\u03BCM","ribavirin","Results","clearing hepatoma cells","genotypes","interferon \u03B1","virus","isoxazolyl","selectivity indices","Background","JFH1","series","nM","particular characteristics","chlorophenyl","methyl","difluorophen","Combinations"],"language":"en"},

Ebola infection represents a worldwide health threat causing enormous mortality rates and fatal epidemics. Major concern is pilgrimage seasons with possible transmission to Middle East populations. In this review, we aim to shed light on Ebola hemorrhagic fever as regard: virology, transmission, biology, pathogenesis, clinical picture, and complications to get the best results for prevention and management. We also aim to guide future research to new therapeutic perspectives to precise targets. Our methodology was to review the literature extensively to make an overall view of the biology of Ebola virus infection, its serious health effects and possible therapeutic benefits using currently available remedies and future perspectives. Key findings in Ebola patients are fever, hepatic impairment, hepatocellular necrosis, lymphopenia (for T-lymphocyte and natural killer cells) with lymphocyte apoptosis, hemorrhagic manifestations, and complications. Pathogenesis in Ebola infection includes oxidative stress, immune suppression of both cell-mediated and humoral immunities, hepatic and adrenal impairment and failure, hemorrhagic fever, activation of deleterious inflammatory pathways, for example, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and factor of apoptotic signal death receptor pathways causing lymphocyte depletion. Several inflammatory mediators and cytokines are involved in pathogenesis, for example, interleukin-2, 6, 8, and 10 and others. In conclusion, Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a serious fatal viral infection that can be prevented using strict health measures and can be treated to some extent using some currently available remedies. Newer treatment lines, for example, prophetic medicine remedies as nigella sativa may be promising.","publish_time":"2016-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Sayed, Salah Mohamed; Abdelrahman, Ali A.; Ozbak, Hani Adnan; Hemeg, Hassan Abdullah; Kheyami, Ali Mohammed; Rezk, Nasser; El-Ghoul, Mohamed Baioumy; Nabo, Manal Mohamed Helmy; Fathy, Yasser Mohamed","journal":"J Res Med Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5244689.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28163730/; https://doi.org/10.4103/1735-1995.192500","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Ebola"],"keyphrases":["Ebola hemorrhagic fever","Ebola infection","Ebola patients","biology of Ebola virus infection","example","hemorrhagic manifestations","pathogenesis","lymphocyte apoptosis","serious fatal viral infection","available remedies","possible transmission","hepatic impairment","serious health effects","T-lymphocyte","lymphocyte depletion","future perspectives","complications","review","possible therapeutic benefits","worldwide health threat","new therapeutic perspectives","prophetic medicine remedies","strict health measures","tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis","adrenal impairment","hepatocellular necrosis","activation of deleterious inflammatory pathways","fatal epidemics","future research","inflammatory mediators","factor of apoptotic signal death receptor pathways","lethal viral disease","enormous mortality rates","regard","virology","oxidative stress","natural killer cells","contact","seasons","ligand","lymphopenia","failure","immune suppression","humoral immunities","light","Middle East populations","infected people","precise targets","nigella sativa","overall view","clinical picture","best results","Newer treatment lines","Key findings","Major concern","prevention","management","literature","animals","cytokines","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

While MERS-CoV has already spread to and within other countries, these mass gatherings could further amplify and/or accelerate its international dissemination, especially since the origins and geographic source of the virus remain poorly understood. Methods: We analyzed 2012 worldwide flight itinerary data and historic Hajj pilgrim data to predict population movements out of Saudi Arabia and the broader Middle East to help cities and countries assess their potential for MERS-CoV importation. We compared the magnitude of travel to countries with their World Bank economic status and per capita healthcare expenditures as surrogate markers of their capacity for timely detection of imported MERS-CoV and their ability to mount an effective public health response. Results: 16.8 million travelers flew on commercial flights out of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates between June and November 2012, of which 51.6% were destined for India (16.3%), Egypt (10.4%), Pakistan (7.8%), the United Kingdom (4.3%), Kuwait (3.6%), Bangladesh (3.1%), Iran (3.1%) and Bahrain (2.9%). Among the 1.74 million foreign pilgrims who performed the Hajj last year, an estimated 65.1% originated from low and lower-middle income countries. Conclusion: MERS-CoV is an emerging pathogen with pandemic potential with its apparent epicenter in Saudi Arabia, where millions of pilgrims will imminently congregate for two international mass gatherings. Understanding global population movements out of the Middle East through the end of this year\u0027s Hajj could help direct anticipatory MERS-CoV surveillance and public health preparedness to mitigate its potential global health and economic impacts.","publish_time":"2013-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Kamran; Sears, Jennifer; Hu, Vivian Wei; Brownstein, John S; Hay, Simon; Kossowsky, David; Eckhardt, Rose; Chim, Tina; Berry, Isha; Bogoch, Isaac; Cetron, Martin","journal":"PLoS Curr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3714242.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.outbreaks.a7b70897ac2fa4f79b59f90d24c860b8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23884087/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Bank"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","United Arab Emirates","India","United Kingdom","Bangladesh","Iran","Bahrain"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV importation","Saudi Arabia","direct anticipatory MERS-CoV surveillance","timely detection of imported MERS-CoV","international mass gatherings","potential global health","broader Middle East","lower-middle income countries","year\u0027s Hajj","pandemic potential","public health preparedness","global population movements","international dissemination","historic Hajj pilgrim data","effective public health response","economic impacts","millions of pilgrims","foreign pilgrims","United Kingdom","United Arab Emirates","worldwide flight itinerary data","World Bank economic status","healthcare expenditures","capacity","surrogate markers","Qatar","apparent epicenter","ability","emerging pathogen","origins","Jordan","cities","life-threatening respiratory disease","commercial flights","novel coronavirus","geographic source","travelers","magnitude of travel","Background","Egypt","Iran","Bangladesh","Kuwait","Methods","Conclusion","India","Pakistan","Bahrain","Results"],"language":"en"},

With the latter cell-virus interaction, relatively small differences in spatial density of oligodendrocytes influence profoundly the duration of persistence and virus yield. The in vitro temporal program of oligodendrocyte differentiation, monitored by induction of a myelin-related enzyme, 2\u2032:3\u2032-cyclic nucleotide-3\u2032-phosphohydrolase, corresponds to that occurring in vivo (F. A. McMorris, J. Neurochem. 41, 506\u2013515, 1983). It is complete within 15\u201321 days and is coincident with the onset of insusceptibility to disease caused by JHMV. Experimental elevation of intracellular cyclic-AMP levels, presumed to reflect oligodendrocyte differentiation, likewise suppresses JHMV replication without affecting that of MHV3 in astrocytes. On the basis of these data it is concluded that in vitro interaction of JHMV with oligodendrocytes reflects accurately the in vivo host control over the tropism and expression of this virus, thereby effecting the progressive, demyelinative disease, process.","publish_time":"1985-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beushausen, S.; Dales, S.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/249a7d9c3b06ef2d4f1ac0b8ed74a741cd586b03.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682285901850; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682285901850","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

Here, we investigated the clinical, cytokine levels, T cell proportion and related gene expression occurring in COVID-19 patients on admission and after intial treatment. METHODS: 11 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimen were enrolled in the hospital. Plasma cytokines, CyTOF and microfluidic qPCR for gene expression were conducted. RESULTS: 5 mild and 6 severe patients were included. Cough and fever were the top symptoms in the 11 COVID-2019 cases. The elder age, more neutrophils numbers and higher C-reactive protein level were found in severe cases. IL-10 level was significantly varied with disease progression and treatment. The decreased T cell proportions were observed in COVID-19 patients especially in severe cases, and all elevated to normal in mild patiens after initial treatment but only CD4\u002BT cells return to normal in severe cases. The number of DEGs increased with the disease progress, and decreased after initial treatment. All down-regulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved in Th17 cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and T cell activation. After initial treatmen in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a decreased T cell proportion with down-regulated gene expression related to T cell activation and differentiation were occurred in COVID-19 severe patients, which may help to provide effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 .","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ouyang, Yabo; Yin, Jiming; Wang, Wenjing; Shi, Hongbo; Shi, Ying; Xu, Bin; Qiao, Luxin; Feng, Yingmei; Pang, Lijun; Wei, Feili; Guo, Xianghua; Jin, Ronghua; Chen, Dexi","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/578f0cc202024ce9fdee39e4ddac118d8ec32d4b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32307550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","severe cases","severe patients","T cell activation","decreased T cell proportions","T cells","intial treatment","Th17 cell differentiation","similar initial treatment regimen","regulated gene expression","related gene expression","effective treatment strategies","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","novel coronavirus disease","regulated DEGs","disease progression","admission","cytokine levels","number of DEGs","higher C-reactive protein level","neutrophils numbers","CyTOF","microfluidic qPCR","MAP2K7","findings","CD4","pathway","SARS-CoV","Plasma cytokines","SOS1","elder age","symptoms","BACKGROUND","Cough","fever","CONCLUSIONS","hospital","RESULTS","METHODS","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

The murine dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Dpp4) protein is not a functional receptor for MERS-CoV; thus, mice are resistant to MERS-CoV infection. We generated human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4 KI) mice by replacing exons 10\u201312 at the mouse Dpp4 locus with exons 10\u201312 from the human DPP4 gene. The resultant human DPP4 KI mice are permissive to MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012 strain) infection but develop no disease. To generate a mouse model with associated morbidity and mortality from respiratory disease, we serially passaged HCoV-EMC/2012 strain in the lungs of young hDPP4 KI mice. After 30 in vivo passages, an adapted virus clone was isolated and designated MERS(MA)6.1.2. This virus clone produced significantly higher titers than the parental clone in the lungs of hDPP4 KI mice and caused diffuse lung injury and a fatal respiratory infection.

An evaluation model based on the theory of intuitionistic fuzzy set and TOPSIS method is proposed. The intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number is used to quantify the fuzzy index and determine the weights of experts. The weight of each index is determined based on the maximizing deviation method. The relevant data of Dalian City from 2013 to 2017 are collected to evaluate the city resilience, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out based on the proposed model. The results may provide insights for the further urban resilience promotion.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xun, Xiaolin; Yuan, Yongbo","journal":"Nat Hazards (Dordr)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f84db85a0cd7ddaf580bc5e14b69afa47932223.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7220654.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412523/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-020-04000-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Dalian City"],"keyphrases":["evaluation of urban resilience","fuzzy indicators","fuzzy index","city resilience","urban resilience promotion","urban resilience evaluation index system","evaluation model","economic development","theory of intuitionistic fuzzy set","intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number","secondary indicators","proposed model","economic fluctuations","social development","primary indicators of ecological environment","TOPSIS method","maximizing deviation method","relevant data of Dalian City","municipal facilities","hybrid multiple attribute group decision-making problem","face of natural disasters","property","people\u2019s lives","important barriers","epidemic diseases","insights","Cities","sensitivity analysis","weights of experts","order","results"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Molecular biology is omnipresent in medical biology especially in microbiology. Many papers report studies on its importance in diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic field, epidemiology, natural (or not) biological risks alike. The important sum of reports on this subject does not always bring an obvious answer to the part that molecular biology could play in a microbiology laboratory either public or private. This article summarizes the contributions of this specialized field in microbiology and brings some questions on its contribution. Is molecular biology a real progress in microbiology? What are the main indications of molecular biology today in this field? According to the infectious particle, the answers are not always simple. They can be obvious in some cases (for instance, hepatitis C) or less obvious in other cases (tuberculosis for instance). In the first part of this article, we reported general remarks in molecular biology related to microbiology. The second part report some important applications underlining the important extent of molecular biology in this field.","publish_time":"2007-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lamoril, J.; Bogard, M.; Ameziane, N.; Deybach, J.-C.; Bouizegar\u00E8ne, P.","journal":"Immuno-analyse \u0026 Biologie Sp\u00E9cialis\u00E9e","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b425749127b05ad3c800bc1d2aff613a0ee4810.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0923253206001591; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923253206001591","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular biology in this field","In the first part","molecular biology today in this field","this specialized field in microbiology","Is molecular biology","Abstract Molecular biology is omnipresent in medical biology especially in microbiology","the answers","real progress in microbiology","its importance in diagnosis","The important sum","This article summarizes the contributions","the main indications","r\u00F4le de la biologie mol\u00E9culaire","examen de biologie mol\u00E9culaire","we reported general remarks in molecular biology related to microbiology","less obvious in other cases","always bring an obvious answer to the part that molecular biology could play in","biologie m\u00E9dicale","laboratoire de microbiologie","The second part report some important applications underlining the important extent","They can be obvious in some cases","According to the infectious particle","exemple","this subject does","therapeutic field","brings some questions","microbiology laboratory either public","importance prise","tuberculosis for instance","its contribution","always simple","nombreux articles","deuxi\u00E8me partie","premi\u00E8re partie","Many papers report studies","prognosis","reports","hepatitis","natural","\u00E9pid\u00E9miologie","epidemiology","pronostic","sujet","private","What","biological risks alike","synth\u00E8se des apports","risques biologiques naturels","\u00E9valuation th\u00E9rapeutique","quantit\u00E9 consid\u00E9rable","r\u00E9ponse \u00E9vidente","h\u00E9patite","domaine du diagnostic","discipline","reflets","g\u00E9n\u00E9ralit\u00E9s appliqu\u00E9es","revue","\u00E9tat des lieux","r\u00E9el apport","r\u00E9ponses","tuberculose"],"language":"fr"},

This experiment evaluated the effects of BRD incidence on subsequent finishing performance, efficiency, carcass characteristics, and lung scores of steers. Crossbred steers (n = 516) were monitored daily for clinical signs of BRD (BRD attributed morbidity and mortality were 66.5 and 13.2%, respectively). A subset of calves (n = 174) were grouped by the number of times treated for BRD (BRDX) and randomly allocated to finishing pens. The BRDX experimental groups included never treated for BRD (0X; 8 pens) and treated 1 time (1X; 8 pens), 2 times (2X; 8 pens), or 3 or 4 times (3/4X; 8 pens). Arrival BW was not different among BRDX groups (P = 0.17); however, BRDX during the receiving period decreased performance, resulting in BW of 324, 316, 285, and 260 kg for 0X, 1X, 2X, and 3/4X, respectively, at the start of finishing (P \u003C 0.001). Ultrasound estimates, BW, and visual appraisal were used to target a common body composition (average days on feed = 182). With increasing BRDX, days on feed increased linearly (P = 0.002), whereas HCW, DP, rib eye area, QG, and unconsolidated lungs decreased linearly (P \u2264 0.03). These results suggest that with additional days on feed, calves treated multiple times for BRD are able to reach similar compositional endpoints as their untreated cohorts; however, it may not be possible for these calves to reach the same QG and carcass yield.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, B.

A recent study showed that MERS-CoV found in North/West- (Morocco) and West-African (Burkina Faso and Nigeria) dromedary camels are genetically distinct from Arabian viruses and have reduced replicative capacity in human cells, potentially due to amino acid changes in one or more viral proteins.

The aim of the present study is to dissect the chemical composition and the pharmacological mechanism of Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD), a clinically used Chinese medicine for treating COVID-19 patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), a total of 129 compounds of QFPD were putatively identified. We also constructed molecular networking of mass spectrometry data to classify these compounds into 14 main clusters, in which exhibited specific patterns of flavonoids (45%), glycosides (15%), carboxylic acids (10%), and saponins (5%). The target network model of QFPD, established by predicting and collecting the targets of identified compounds, indicated a pivotal role of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSG) in the therapeutic efficacy of QFPD. Supportively, through transcriptomic analysis of gene expression after MXSG administration in rat model of LPS-induced pneumonia, the thrombin and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway were suggested to be essential pathways for MXSG mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Besides, changes in content of major compounds in MXSG during decoction were found by the chemical analysis. We also validate that one major compound in MXSG, i.e. glycyrrhizic acid, inhibited TLR agonists induced IL-6 production in macrophage. In conclusion, the integration of in silico and experimental results indicated that the therapeutic effects of QFPD against COVID-19 may be attributed to the anti-inflammatory effects of MXSG, which supports the rationality of the compatibility of TCM.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Ruocong; Liu, Hao; Bai, Chen; Wang, Yingchao; Zhang, Xiaohui; Guo, Rui; Wu, Siying; Wang, Jianxun; Leung, Elaine; Chang, Hang; Li, Peng; Liu, Tiegang; Wang, Yi","journal":"Pharmacol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a059265a05861f50954210df5d81f20b83ce1d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194979.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661820311282; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820311282?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360484/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104820","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction"],"organizations":["Qingfei Paidu Decoction","QFPD","MXSG","TLR","TCM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["compounds of QFPD","anti-inflammatory effects of MXSG","therapeutic effects of QFPD","MXSG administration","therapeutic efficacy of QFPD","COVID","chemical analysis","content of major compounds","targets of identified compounds","target network model of QFPD","comprehensive analysis","efficient therapeutic strategy","high resolution mass spectrometry","transcriptomic analysis of gene expression","induced pneumonia","chemical composition","pharmacological mechanism of Qingfei Paidu Decoction","molecular networking of mass spectrometry data","rat model of LPS","inhibited TLR agonists","pivotal role of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction","glycyrrhizic acid","liquid chromatography","urgent demand","thrombin","Toll","MS","experimental results","essential pathways","integration","silico","global health","production","receptor","total","present study","main clusters","specific patterns of flavonoids","patients","rationality","Chinese medicine","changes","glycosides","compatibility of TCM","aim","conclusion","macrophage","Coronavirus Disease","pandemic","China","carboxylic acids","saponins"],"language":"en"},

One important way to help combat a pandemic of viral infectious diseases is early detection before large scale outbreaks occur. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) have been used to identify precisely different strains of some very closely related pathogens. However, isolation and detection of viral RNA in the field are difficult due to the unstable nature of viral RNA molecules. Consequently, performing in-the-field nucleic acid analysis to monitor the spread of viruses is financially and technologically challenging in remote and underdeveloped regions that are high-risk areas for outbreaks. A simplified rapid viral RNA extraction method is reported to meet the requirements for in-the-field viral RNA extraction and detection. The ability of this device to perform viral RNA extraction with subsequent RT-PCR detection of retrovirus is demonstrated. This inexpensive device has the potential to be distributed on a large scale to underdeveloped regions for early detection of retrovirus, with the possibility of reducing viral pandemic events.","publish_time":"2007-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Jiang F.; Weiner, Leslie P.; Burke, Kathy; Taylor, Clive R.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfcdea4ae899212b784175e69a375d67f450fdc9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e180d3d901f3b04c492af778d0b9155a51058d51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3635480.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093407001553; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093407001553; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3635480?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of viral RNA","field viral RNA extraction","unstable nature of viral RNA molecules","viral pandemic events","simplified rapid viral RNA extraction method","early detection of retrovirus","subsequent RT-PCR detection of retrovirus","pandemic of viral infectious diseases","reverse transcription-PCR","underdeveloped regions","large scale outbreaks","field nucleic acid analysis","inexpensive device","possibility","high-risk areas","polymerase chain reaction","genetic information","high genomic recombination rate","spread of viruses","potential","Retroviruses","isolation","different strains","related pathogens","higher risk","humans","important way","requirements","ability"],"language":"en"},

Despite the extensive efforts taken in the past decades, development of the \u201Cideal\u201D live attenuated FIPV vaccine was not successful yet. In the present study, we provide data of immunisation experiments with a recombinant FCoV pair differing only in the truncation (PBFIPV-DF-2) or completion (PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i) of their ORF3abc regions. In our previous in vivo studies, these viruses proved to show the characters of low virulent or avirulent FCoV phenotypes, respectively. Therefore, we hypothesised the ability of these viruses, as possible vaccine candidates, in conferring protection in specific pathogen free (SPF) Domestic Shorthair as well as in conventional purebred British Shorthair cats. In SPF cats, after two oronasal and two intramuscular vaccinations with two weeks intervals, both vaccine candidates provided 100% protection against lethal homologous challenge with the highly virulent FIPV DF-2 strain. In contrast, the conventional purebred British Shorthair cats did not develop protection when they were immunised with the same vaccination regimes. In these groups 100% of the PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i immunised animals developed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Prolonged survival was observed in 40% of the animals, while 60% showed fulminant disease course. Genetic and more probably immunological differences between the SPF and non-SPF purebred kittens can explain the different outcome of the vaccination experiment.

In dogs, a CoV associated with mild enteritis, canine coronavirus (CCoV), has been known since 1970s. CoV strains with different biological and genetic properties with respect to classical CCoV strains have been identified in dogs in the last few years, leading to a full reconsideration of the CoV-induced canine diseases. The genetic evolution of dog CoVs is paradigmatic of how CoVs evolve through accumulation of point mutations, insertions or deletions in the viral genome, that led to the emergence of new genotypes (CCoV type I), biotypes (pantropic CCoV) and host variants (canine respiratory coronavirus).

Synthetic lethal mutations (non-lethal when alone but lethal when combined in one genome) have been studied to develop cancer therapies. This principle can also be used against fast-evolving RNA-viruses. Indeed, targeting protein sites involved in SD \u002B SL interactions with a drug would render any mutation of such sites, lethal. RESULTS: Here, we set up a strategy to detect intragenic pairs of SL and SD at the surface of the protein to predict less escapable drug target sites. For this, we detected SD \u002B SL, studying HIV protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequence alignments from two groups of VIH(\u002B) individuals: treated with drugs (T) or not (NT). Using a series of statistical approaches, we were able to propose bona fide SD \u002B SL couples. When focusing on spatially close co-variant SD \u002B SL couples at the surface of the protein, we found 5 SD \u002B SL groups (2 in the protease and 3 in the reverse transcriptase), which could be good candidates to form pockets to accommodate potential drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, designing drugs targeting these specific SD \u002B SL groups would not allow the virus to mutate any residue involved in such groups without losing an essential function. Moreover, we also show that the selection pressure induced by the treatment leads to the appearance of new mutations, which change the mutational landscape of the protein. This drives the existence of differential SD \u002B SL couples between the drug-treated and non-treated groups. Thus, new anti-viral drugs should be designed differently to target such groups.

A time periodic geographical disease surveillance system based on a cylindrical space-time scan statistic has been used extensively for disease surveillance along with the SaTScan software. In the purely spatial setting, many different methods have been proposed to detect spatial disease clusters. In particular, some spatial scan statistics are aimed at detecting irregularly shaped clusters which may not be detected by the circular spatial scan statistic. RESULTS: Based on the flexible purely spatial scan statistic, we propose a flexibly shaped space-time scan statistic for early detection of disease outbreaks. The performance of the proposed space-time scan statistic is compared with that of the cylindrical scan statistic using benchmark data. In order to compare their performances, we have developed a space-time power distribution by extending the purely spatial bivariate power distribution. Daily syndromic surveillance data in Massachusetts, USA, are used to illustrate the proposed test statistic. CONCLUSION: The flexible space-time scan statistic is well suited for detecting and monitoring disease outbreaks in irregularly shaped areas.","publish_time":"2008-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takahashi, Kunihiko; Kulldorff, Martin; Tango, Toshiro; Yih, Katherine","journal":"Int J Health Geogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b67b75854801b20d8d89d71adf85199ec70c3daa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2386448.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18402711/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-072x-7-14","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cylindrical scan statistic","shaped space-time scan statistic","proposed space-time scan statistic","cylindrical space-time scan statistic","flexible space-time scan statistic","circular spatial scan statistic","spatial disease clusters","spatial scan statistics","disease control","proposed test statistic","monitoring disease outbreaks","Early detection of disease outbreaks","spatial setting","space-time power distribution","spatial bivariate power distribution","time periodic geographical disease surveillance system","shaped clusters","syndromic surveillance data","shaped areas","benchmark data","earliest possible time","public health officials","prevention measures","Massachusetts","USA","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","different methods","SaTScan software","performances","order","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The virus sequence was identical in four of these five patients. The sequence data from one hospital case and the four identical community cases had only three nucleotide differences. Alterations in the SARS coronavirus genome are unlikely to have caused the distinctive clinical features of the Amoy Gardens patients, and these results highlight the importance of non-viral genomic factors in this outbreak.","publish_time":"2003-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chim, SSC; Tsui, SKW; Chan, KCA; Au, TCC; Hung, ECW; Tong, YK; Chiu, RWK; Ng, EKO; Chan, PKS; Chu, CM; Sung, JJY; Tam, JS; Fung, KP; Waye, MMY; Lee, CY; Yuen, KY; Lo, YMD","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119348.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S014067360314901X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067360314901X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong","Amoy Gardens"],"keyphrases":["Amoy Gardens patients","Amoy Gardens apartments","viral isolates","hospital case","genomic sequencing","major outbreaks","sequence data","virus sequence","importance of non-viral genomic factors","SARS coronavirus genome","identical community cases","results","distinctive clinical features","admission","intensive care","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","mortality","frequency of diarrhoea","nucleotide differences","global health concern","Hong Kong","Alterations"],"language":"en"},

However, conventional live attenuated vaccines are expensive and result in the inability to differentiate between infected and vaccinated chickens. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new efficacious vaccines. In this study, using a previously established reverse genetics system, we generated a recombinant IBV virus based on the IBV H120 vaccine strain expressing the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of NDV. The recombinant virus, R-H120-HN/5a, exhibited growth dynamics, pathogenicity and viral titers that were similar to those of the parental IBV H120, but it had acquired hemagglutination activity from NDV. Vaccination of SPF chickens with the R-H120-HN/5a virus induced a humoral response at a level comparable to that of the LaSota/H120 commercial bivalent vaccine and provided significant protection against challenge with virulent IBV and NDV. In summary, the results of this study indicate that the IBV H120 strain could serve as an effective tool for designing vaccines against IB and other infectious diseases, and the generation of IBV R-H120-HN/5a provides a solid foundation for the development of an effective bivalent vaccine against IBV and NDV.","publish_time":"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Xin; Zhou, Yingshun; Li, Jianan; Fu, Li; Ji, Gaosheng; Zeng, Fanya; Zhou, Long; Gao, Wenqian; Wang, Hongning","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b1b1794fd25ebbbe0839b59ed72f3cbe3e2188b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087005.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26873815/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-016-2764-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","ND","IBV","NDV","IB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV H120 strain","parental IBV H120","IBV H120 vaccine strain","recombinant IBV virus","generation of IBV R-H120","virulent IBV","NDV-LaSota","HN","H120 commercial bivalent vaccine","live attenuated strains of IBV","recombinant virus","protein of NDV","infectious bronchitis virus","Newcastle disease virus","infectious diseases","effective bivalent vaccine","conventional live attenuated vaccines","common viral diseases of chickens","control of IB","study","Vaccination of SPF chickens","vaccinated chickens","new efficacious vaccines","viral titers","effective tool","significant protection","haemagglutinin-neuraminidase","challenge","pathogenicity","development","growth dynamics","established reverse genetics system","inability","level comparable","urgent need","humoral response","solid foundation","hemagglutination activity","summary","results"],"language":"en"},

Our first objective was to examine whether variation in growth performance in healthy veal calves can be predicted from early life characterization of these calves. Our second objective was to determine whether these predictions differ between calves that are fed a high- or low-lactose MR in later life. A total of 180 male Holstein-Friesian calves arrived at the facilities at 17 \u00B1 3.4 d of age, and blood samples were collected before the first feeding. Subsequently, calves were characterized in the following 9 wk (period 1) using targeted challenges related to traits within each of 5 categories: feeding motivation, digestion, postabsorptive metabolism, behavior and stress, and immunology. In period 2 (wk 10\u201326), 130 calves were equally divided over 2 MR treatments: a control MR that contained lactose as the only carbohydrate source and a low-lactose MR in which 51% of the lactose was isocalorically replaced by glucose, fructose, and glycerol (2:1:2 ratio). Relations between early life characteristics and growth performance in later life were assessed in 117 clinically healthy calves. Average daily gain (ADG) in period 2 tended to be greater for control calves (1,292 \u00B1 111 g/d) than for calves receiving the low-lactose MR (1,267 \u00B1 103 g/d). Observations in period 1 were clustered per category using principal component analysis, and the resulting principal components were used to predict performance in period 2 using multiple regression procedures. Variation in observations in period 1 predicted 17% of variation in ADG in period 2. However, this was mainly related to variation in solid feed refusals. When ADG was adjusted to equal solid feed intake, only 7% of the variation in standardized ADG in period 2, in fact reflecting feed efficiency, could be explained by early life measurements. This indicates that \u003E90% of the variation in feed efficiency in later life could not be explained by early life characterization of the calves. It is speculated that variation in health status explains a substantial portion of variation in feed efficiency in later life. Significant relations between fasting plasma glucose concentrations, fecal pH, drinking speed, and plasma natural antibodies in early life (i.e., not exposed to the lactose replacer) and feed efficiency in later life depended on MR composition. These measurements are therefore potential tools for screening calves in early life on their ability to cope with MR varying in lactose content.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gilbert, M.

Fresh water is an even more precious commodity than oil today as this is seen as a rapidly diminishing resource through over use of aquifers with scarce and unpredictable rainfall not replenishing the needs of these countries which increasing rely on reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination of seawater but at a cost in terms of energy. Recycling of waste water and sewage is carried out and used to water urban landscaping and some crops, but there are risks of the presence of pathogens. Much food today is imported to satisfy the requirements of expanding populations, especially foreign workers on temporary visas who make up more than half the residents in many of these Gulf States. Despite limited published data on Gulf States regarding enteric and foodborne diseases and their prevention and control, profiles emerge that can describe the current situation and some future directions. Gastrointestinal diseases, such as typhoid, cholera, and amebic dysentery can be brought into these countries through workers returning from endemic regions, and also through refugees from conflict-torn neighboring countries. However, some diseases are endemic like brucellosis and fatal illnesses from the newly identified Middle East Respiratory Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) associated with camels. In the 1990s, coalition troops stationed during the Gulf War brought in external suppliers and caterers, but using local products like chickens with troops occasionally suffering from infections. The hot climate, particularly in summer, can allow rapid growth of pathogens in foods, especially where refrigeration is not available as in home-prepared lunches by workers and during transportation of foods across traffic-congested cities. One of the biggest concerns for Saudi Arabia is the health oversight of millions during the annual Hajj, and despite much care over restriction of infected pilgrims and care of food, occasional outbreaks have been reported. Government agencies are particularly concerned about restaurant food and try and follow up on complaints of customers but rarely are agents identified; those that have include Salmonella, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Implicated foods include ethnic products such as Turkish menu items and shawarma. Local culture may play a role in allowing growth of pathogens such as serving women after men at weddings. However, deaths that have been attributed to microbial sources may have been caused by illegal use of pesticides such as aluminum phosphide. Severe penalties have been applied to owners and staff implicated in outbreaks including fines, jail sentences and deportations, which are not typical of Western nations. However, some agencies have initiatives to help educate and train foreign workers in several languages. Foodborne disease surveillance systems are generally not adequate though some countries have initiated modernization of inspection approaches and laboratories. Consumer surveys show that residents have some knowledge of foodborne disease but this could be improved especially for women who do most of the shopping and food preparation in homes. Agencies are increasing directing campaigns for general food safety in their populations, and as long as resources are available, food control is likely to improve over time in Gulf States which is good news for visitors, expatriate workers and citizens alike.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Todd, Ewen C.D.","journal":"Food Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52cab729d50b0a3aac9bf9e2b3c570709a062170.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126945.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713516304510; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.08.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956713516304510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288324/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Gulf States","Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["care of food","food control","Abstract Gulf States","food preparation","restaurant food","modern states","Gulf War","expatriate workers","foodborne diseases","train foreign workers","general food safety","local products","Implicated foods","ethnic products","transportation of foods","petroleum products","knowledge of foodborne disease","Gastrointestinal diseases","residents","rapid growth of pathogens","presence of pathogens","women","Government agencies","Fresh water","Foodborne disease surveillance systems","conflict-torn neighboring countries","Recycling of waste water","use of aquifers","occasional outbreaks","coalition troops","endemic regions","Local culture","Middle East Respiratory Corona Virus","illegal use of pesticides","requirements of expanding populations","fishing communities","good news","MERS-CoV","farming","refugees","visitors","health oversight of millions","Saudi Arabia","exploitation of revenue","Turkish menu items","desalination of seawater","fines","caterers","home-prepared lunches","fatal illnesses","restriction of infected pilgrims","directing campaigns","prevention","time","unpredictable rainfall","annual Hajj","external suppliers","modernization of inspection approaches","cost","Salmonella","Bacillus cereus","Staphylococcus aureus","deportations","subsidence herding","reverse-osmosis","owners","summer","jail sentences","cholera","brucellosis","shopping","chickens","refrigeration","published data","resources","traffic-congested cities","current situation","biggest concerns","amebic dysentery","aluminum phosphide","precious commodity","temporary visas","future directions","laboratories","shawarma","diminishing resource","staff","profiles","sewage","needs","citizens","homes","initiatives","languages","terms of energy","Consumer surveys","typical of Western nations","urban landscaping","crops","complaints of customers","agents","microbial sources","Severe penalties","hot climate","oil","camels","weddings","infections","deaths"],"language":"en"},

The median lethal concentration (96 h) of CQ was 31.62 mg/ml. During acute treatment (CQ at 31.62 mg/ml) the treated fish groups showed a significant increase in GOT and GPT activities in blood plasma; whereas LDH activity was decreased when compare to control groups. To analyse the effects of drug at the lowest concentration, the fish were exposed to 3.16 mg/ml (1/10th of 96 h LC50 value) for 96 h. In sublethal treatment (3.16 mg/ml) GOT activity increased up to 14th day and decreased during the rest of the exposure period (21, 28 and 35th day). A biphasic response in GPT activity was observed. LDH activity was found to be increased throughout the study period (35 days) compare to control groups. The alterations in enzyme activities in blood plasma were found to be significant at p \u003C 0.05 (DMRT). Many histopathological changes in vital organs such as gill, liver and kidney of fish were observed in CQ treated group (acute and sub-lethal) compare to normal group. The alterations in the enzymological and histopathological study in the present investigation indicate that the drug CQ has toxic effects on non-target organisms. We conclude that the alterations in enzymological parameters and histopathological changes can be used as biomarker to assess the health of the aquatic organism/environment.

In developing countries, gastroenteritis is a common cause of death in children under 5 years that can be linked to a wide variety of pathogens. In developed countries, while deaths from diarrhoea are less common, much illness leads to hospitalization or doctor visits. Much of the gastroenteritis in children is caused by viruses belonging to four distinct families: rotaviruses, caliciviruses, astroviruses and adenoviruses. Viral gastroenteritis occurs with two epidemiologic patterns, diarrhoea that is endemic in children and outbreaks that affect people of all ages. Rotavirus infection causes severe gastroenteritis, particularly in infants under six months of age.","publish_time":"2007-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olives, J.-P.; Mas, E.","journal":"Archives de P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec96d05a4d7eb88ed151f2f8818802a4a4d8a6cd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X07800194; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X07800194","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe gastroenteritis","Viral gastroenteritis","children","molecular characterization of gastroenteritis viruses","diarrhoea","developed countries","developing countries","common cause of death","wide variety of pathogens","rotaviruses","caliciviruses","illness","epidemiologic patterns","distinct families","astroviruses","development","hospitalization","outbreaks","infants","deaths","new generation of diagnostics","doctor visits","adenoviruses","people","Rotavirus infection","advances","months of age","ages"],"language":"en"},

One specific application is to monitor compliance of website and social media activity with respect to jurisdictional regulations. These data may then identify breaches of compliance and inform disciplinary actions. Our study aimed to evaluate the novel use of internet analytics by a Canadian chiropractic regulator to determine their registrants compliance with three regulations related to specific health conditions, pregnancy conditions and most recently, claims of improved immunity during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: A customized internet search tool (Market Review Tool, MRT) was used by the College of Chiropractors of British Columbia (CCBC), Canada to audit registrants websites and social media activity. The audits extracted words whose use within specific contexts is not permitted under CCBC guidelines. The MRT was first used in October of 2018 to identify words related to specific health conditions. The MRT was again used in December 2019 for words related to pregnancy and most recently in March 2020 for words related to COVID-19. In these three MRT applications, potential cases of word misuse were evaluated by the regulator who then notified the practitioner to comply with existing regulations by a specific date. The MRT was then used on that date to determine compliance. Those found to be non-compliant were referred to the regulator\u2019s inquiry committee. We mapped this process and reported the outcomes with permission of the regulator. RESULTS: In September 2018, 250 inappropriate mentions of specific health conditions were detected from approximately 1250 registrants with 2 failing to comply. The second scan for pregnancy related terms of approximately1350 practitioners revealed 83 inappropriate mentions. Following notification, all 83 cases were compliant within the specified timeframe. Regarding COVID-19 related words, 97 inappropriate mentions of the word \u201Cimmune\u201D were detected from 1350 registrants with 7 cases of non-compliance. CONCLUSION: Internet analytics are an effective way for regulators to monitor internet activity to protect the public from misleading statements. The processes described were effective at bringing about rapid practitioner compliance. Given the increasing volume of internet activity by healthcare professionals, internet analytics are an important addition for health care regulators to protect the public they serve.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kawchuk, Greg; Hartvigsen, Jan; Innes, Stan; Simpson, J.

In contrast, among the five Birman FIP cat-associated SNPs, no genotype or allele showed significant differences between our FIP and non-FIP groups. As disease resistance is multifactorial and several other host genes could involve in the development of FIP, the five genetic traits identified in this study should facilitate in the future breeding of the disease-resistant animal to reduce the occurrence of cats succumbing to FIP.

A high prevalence of parvovirus DNA (63%) was detected among all surveyed species, particularly in mongooses (58%) and red foxes (79%), along with the presence of CPV/FPLV circulating antibodies that were identified in 90% of a subset of parvovirus-DNA positive samples. Most specimens were extensively autolysed, restricting macro and microscopic investigations for lesion evaluation. Whenever possible to examine, signs of active disease were not present, supporting the hypothesis that the parvovirus vp2 gene fragments detected by real-time PCR possibly correspond to viral DNA reminiscent from previous infections. The molecular characterization of viruses, based on the analysis of the complete or partial sequence of the vp2 gene, allowed typifying three viral strains of mongoose and four red fox\u2019s as feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) and one stone marten\u2019s as newCPV-2b type. The genetic similarity found between the FPLV viruses from free-ranging and captive wild species originated in Portugal and publicly available comparable sequences, suggests a closer genetic relatedness among FPLV circulating in Portugal. Although the clinical and epidemiological significance of infection could not be established, this study evidences that exposure of sympatric wild carnivores to parvovirus is common and geographically widespread, potentially carrying a risk to susceptible populations at the wildlife-domestic interface and to threatened species, such as the wildcat (Felis silvestris) and the critically endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus).","publish_time":"2013-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duarte, Margarida D.; Henriques, Ana Margarida; Barros, S\u00EDlvia Carla; Fagulha, Teresa; Mendon\u00E7a, Paula; Carvalho, Paulo; Monteiro, Madalena; Fevereiro, Miguel; Basto, Mafalda P.; Rosalino, Lu\u00EDs Miguel; Barros, T\u00E2nia; Bandeira, Victor; Fonseca, Carlos; Cunha, M\u00F3nica V.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f65cdf4a48c1ad11e613449dad480736e9d26945.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3603882.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23527182/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPV/FPLV","PCR"],"locations":["Portugal"],"keyphrases":["FPLV viruses","subset of parvovirus","Portugal","parvovirus vp2 gene fragments","high prevalence of parvovirus DNA","viral DNA reminiscent","exposure of wild carnivores","captive wild species","viral pathogens","viral strains of mongoose","exposure of sympatric wild carnivores","red fox\u2019s","DNA positive samples","Meles meles","Genetta genetta","Vulpes vulpes","red foxes","surveyed species","molecular characterization of viruses","stone marten\u2019s","common genet","Egyptian mongoose","Lynx pardinus","genetic similarity","molecular screening of tissue samples","presence of CPV","closer genetic relatedness","endangered Iberian lynx","real-time PCR","macro","emphasis","feline panleukopenia virus","available comparable sequences","microscopic investigations","hunted","partial sequence","hypothesis","typifying","Eurasian badger","wildlife-domestic interface","susceptible populations","study evidences","risk","lesion evaluation","newCPV","analysis","road","previous infections","Herpestes ichneumon","Martes foina","signs of active disease","Felis silvestris","b type","epidemiological significance of infection","wildcat","animals","mongooses","antibodies","specimens"],"language":"en"},

This paper reports an evaluation of the knowledge, attitude, practices and sources of information relating to SARS among physicians who staffed the SARS fever hotline service. A retrospective survey was conducted using a self-administered postal questionnaire. Participants were physicians who staffed a SARS hotline during the SARS epidemic in Taipei, Taiwan from June 1 to 10, 2003. A response rate of 83% was obtained. All respondents knew the causative agent of SARS, and knowledge regarding SARS features and preventive practices was good. However, only 54% of respondents knew the incubation period of SARS. Hospital guidelines and news media were the major information sources. In responding to two case scenarios most physicians were likely to triage callers at high risk of SARS appropriately, but not callers at low risk. Less than half of all respondents answered both scenarios correctly. The results obtained suggest that knowledge of SARS was generally good although obtained from both medical and non-medical sources. Specific knowledge was however lacking in certain areas and this affected the ability to appropriately triage callers. Standardized education and assessment of prior knowledge of SARS could improve the ability of physicians to triage callers in future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2006-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, J.-F.; Olowokure, B.; Kaydos-Daniels, S.

Here we show that passage of this mutant in the presence of high ribavirin concentrations resulted in selection of viruses with the additional replacement I248T in 2C. This 2C substitution alone (even in the absence of replacements in 3D) increased FMDV fitness mainly in the presence of ribavirin, prevented an incorporation bias in favor of A and U associated with ribavirin mutagenesis, and conferred the ATPase activity of 2C decreased sensitivity to ribavirin-triphosphate. Since in previous studies we described that 2C with I248T was selected under different selective pressures, this replacement qualifies as a joker substitution in FMDV evolution. The results have identified a role of 2C in nucleotide incorporation, and have unveiled a new polymerase-independent mechanism of virus escape to lethal mutagenesis.","publish_time":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agudo, Rub\u00E9n; de la Higuera, Ignacio; Arias, Armando; Grande-P\u00E9rez, Ana; Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a2c73c83ab748f40eacadc216d767e7bc53ca25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111656.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216300903; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216300903; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.04.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27136067/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of ribavirin","ribavirin mutagenesis","ribavirin-triphosphate","C substitution","presence of high ribavirin concentrations","C decreased sensitivity","FMDV fitness","mutagenic nucleoside analogue ribavirin","FMDV evolution","additional replacement I248T","incorporation bias","lethal mutagenesis","nucleotide incorporation","absence of replacements","joker substitution","new polymerase-independent mechanism of virus","mouth disease virus","amino acid replacements","selection of viruses","ATPase activity","resistance","different selective pressures","role","mutant","favor","foot","passage","previous studies","results"],"language":"en"},

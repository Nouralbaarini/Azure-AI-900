Here, we report an ARD outbreak caused by HAdV\u20107 in a military training camp in Shaanxi Province, China, from February to March of 2012. Epidemic data and samples from the patients were collected, and viral nucleotides from samples and viral isolations were detected and sequenced. IgG and IgA antibodies against HAdV, and the neutralization antibodies against the viral strain isolated in this outbreak, were detected. Epidemiological study showed that all personnel affected were males with an average age of 19.1 years. Two peaks appeared on the epicurve and there was an 8\u2010day interval between peaks. Laboratory results of viral nucleotide detection carried out with clinical specimens were positive for HAdV (83.33%, 15/18). Further study through serum antibody assay, virus isolation and phylogenetic analysis showed that HAdV\u20107 was the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak. IgA antibody began to appear on the 4th day after the onset and showed 100% positivity on the 8th day. The virus strain in the present outbreak was highly similar to the virus isolated in Hanzhong Shaanxi in 2009. We conclude that HAdV\u20107 was the pathogen corresponding to the outbreak, and this is the first report of an ARD outbreak caused by HAdV\u20107 in military persons in China. Vaccine development, as well as enhanced epidemiological and virological surveillance of HAdV infections in China should be emphasized.","publish_time":"2013-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Pengbo; Ma, Chaofeng; Nawaz, Muhammad; Han, Lei; Zhang, Jianfang; Du, Quanli; Zhang, Lixia; Feng, Qunling; Wang, Jingjun; Xu, Jiru","journal":"Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a36d94ee217a56b15b3313266971e4e2af927bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168384.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1348-0421.12074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23734976/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ARD outbreak","present outbreak","viral strain","China","virological surveillance of HAdV infections","viral isolations","viral nucleotides","virus strain","virus isolation","Epidemiological study","samples","military populations","military persons","IgA antibodies","IgA antibody","Outbreaks of ARD","day interval","peaks","report","military training camp","Laboratory results of viral nucleotide detection","neutralization antibodies","Shaanxi Province","Hanzhong Shaanxi","serum antibody assay","clinical specimens","phylogenetic analysis","patients","personnel","average age","etiological agent responsible","males","Epidemic data","IgG","Vaccine development","years","onset","positivity","countries","pathogen","epicurve"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) proteases are attractive targets for the development of antiviral drugs to reduce viral replication and pathogenicity. The structure and activity of the coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) has already been elucidated, and the design of inhibitors to 3CLpro as therapeutics has been proposed. The chapter discusses SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors that include covalent inhibitors, noncovalent inhibitors, and inhibitors from screening. SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) is considered an equally viable target to 3CLpro for drug design because both are essential for viral replication. However, PLpro has likely not been pursued because of the paucity of structural information. Several compounds have been identified that have shown inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV. However, no information regarding their mechanism of action or the corresponding target is known. Glycyrrhizin showed inhibitory activity for SARS-CoV replication with EC50 = 300 mg/L after virus absorption in Vero cells. Some glycyrrhizin acid derivatives were found to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro with EC50 values ranging from 5 to 50 \u03BCM.

This relies in large part on the delicate interplay between immune suppressive regulatory CD4(\u002B) T (Treg) cells and immune effectors that without active suppression by Treg cells cause systemic and organ-specific autoimmunity. Although these beneficial roles have been classically described as counterbalanced by impaired host defence against infection, newfound protective roles for Treg cells against specific viral pathogens (e.g. herpes simplex virus 2, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus) have been uncovered using transgenic mice that allow in vivo Treg-cell ablation based on Foxp3 expression. In turn, Foxp3(\u002B) Treg cells also provide protection against some parasitic (Plasmodium sp., Toxoplasma gondii) and fungal (Candida albicans) pathogens. By contrast, for bacterial and mycobacterial infections (e.g. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), experimental manipulation of Foxp3(\u002B) cells continues to indicate detrimental roles for Treg cells in host defence. This variance is probably related to functional plasticity in Treg cell suppression that shifts discordantly following infection with different types of pathogens. Furthermore, the efficiency whereby Treg cells silence immune activation coupled with the plasticity in Foxp3(\u002B) cell activity suggest that overriding Treg-mediated suppression represents a prerequisite \u2018signal zero\u2019 that together with other stimulation signals [T-cell receptor (signal 1), co-stimulation (signal 2), inflammatory cytokines (signal 3)] are essential for T-cell activation in vivo.

This study relies on simple subcellular fractionation used to obtain soluble- and membrane-enriched fractions followed by 2-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) separation and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The cells were collected using a brushing technique applied on NE of clinically evaluated volunteers. Subsequently, the soluble- and the membrane-protein enriched fractions were prepared and analyzed in parallel using 2D-LC-MS/MS. In a set of 1482 identified proteins, 947 (63.9%) proteins were found to be associated to membrane fraction. Grand average hydropathy value index (GRAVY) analysis, the transmembrane protein mapping and annotations of primary location deposited in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) confirmed an enrichment of hydrophobic proteins on this dataset. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of soluble fraction revealed an enrichment of molecular and cellular functions associated with cell death, protein folding and drug metabolism while in membrane fraction showed an enrichment of functions associated with molecular transport, protein trafficking and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction. The IPA showed similar enrichment of functions associated with cellular growth and proliferation in both soluble and membrane subproteomes. This finding was in agreement with protein content analysis using exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI). A comparison of our data with previously published studies focusing on respiratory tract epithelium revealed similarities related to identification of proteins associated with physical barrier function and immunological defence. In summary, we extended the NE molecular profile by identifying and characterizing proteins associated to pivotal functions of a respiratory epithelium, including the control of fluid volume and ionic composition at the airways\u0027 surface, physical barrier maintenance, detoxification and immunological defence. The extent of similarities supports the applicability of a less invasive analysis of NE to assess prognosis and treatment response of lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","publish_time":"2011-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sim\u00F5es, T\u00E2nia; Charro, Nuno; Blonder, Josip; Faria, Daniel; Couto, Francisco M.; Chan, King C.; Waybright, Timothy; Isaaq, Haleem J.; Veenstra, Timothy D.; Penque, Deborah","journal":"J Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d03d96612a27c7ed946acb2d03f45f2a8261b712.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185466.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187439191100203X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187439191100203X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.05.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21621024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein content analysis","protein trafficking","membrane-protein enriched fractions","membrane fraction","enrichment of molecular","soluble fraction","enrichment of hydrophobic proteins","transmembrane protein mapping","cellular functions","similar enrichment of functions","invasive analysis of NE","MS","identification of proteins","characterizing proteins","membrane-enriched fractions","membrane subproteomes","identified proteins","modified protein abundance index","NE molecular profile","Human Protein Reference Database","pivotal functions","respiratory epithelium","molecular transport","respiratory tract epithelium","Ingenuity Pathway Analysis","cell death","D-LC","immunological defence","IPA","physical barrier maintenance","physical barrier function","cellular growth","extent of similarities","comprehensive proteomic profiling of nasal epithelium","Grand average hydropathy value index","GRAVY","cystic fibrosis","asthma","airways\u0027 surface","prognosis","ionic composition","annotations of primary location","tandem mass spectrometry","treatment response of lung diseases","separation","detoxification","HPRD","proliferation","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","published studies","control of fluid volume","drug metabolism","dimensional liquid chromatography","simple subcellular fractionation","applicability","emPAI","agreement","brushing technique","study","finding","dataset","evaluated volunteers","cells","comparison","summary","interaction"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 and positive swab-test undergoing to a chest CT on third-generation DSCT were included. The imaging protocol included a dual-energy acquisition (HD-DECT, 90/150Sn kVp) and fast, low-dose, long-pitch CT, dual-source scan at 100Sn kVp (LDCT). Subjective (Likert Scales) and objective (signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, SNR and CNR) analyses were performed; radiation dose and acquisition times were recorded. Nonparametric tests were used. RESULTS: The median radiation dose was lower for LDCT than HD-DECT (Effective dose, ED: 0.28 mSv vs. 3.28 mSv, p = 0.016). LDCT had median acquisition time of 0.62 s (vs 2.02 s, p = 0.016). SNR and CNR were significantly different in several thoracic structures between HD-DECT and LDCT, with exception of lung parenchyma. Qualitative analysis demonstrated significant reduction in motion artifacts (p = 0.031) with comparable diagnostic reliability between HD-DECT and LDCT.

Methods The authors designed a benchtop experiment to evaluate spatter patterns after performing simulated occlusal surface preparations on three typodont teeth in a dental manikin. Fluorescein dye served as the marker to enable visualization of the spatter distribution. The authors compared the effectiveness of a nonisolated control consisting of high-volume evacuation (HVE) alone with that of two dry-field isolation techniques: a dental dam with HVE and the Isolite system (Isolite Systems, Santa Barbara, Calif). Results The authors performed a two-way analysis of variance. Both the Isolite device and the dental dam with HVE exhibited a significant decrease in the number of contaminated squares (P \u003C .001) compared with that for the nonisolated control. In addition, overall, the results showed no statistically significant difference between the Isolite system and the dental dam with HVE (P = .126). Conclusions The study results showed that use of a dental dam with HVE or the Isolite system significantly reduced spatter overall compared with use of HVE alone.

Moreover, GAS pharyngitis is currently the only commonly occurring form of acute pharyngitis for which antibiotic therapy is definitely indicated. Therefore the differentiation between GAS pharyngitis and that of viral etiology is crucial. Accordingly, scientific societies as well as respected advisory bodies in Europe and North America, issued guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis with the aim of minimizing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in its treatment. The aim of this review work is to confront the state of the art in acute GAS pharyngitis diagnosis and treatment with different approaches to its management represented by current European and North American guidelines. Although based on scientific evidence, international guidelines differ substantially in opinions whether GAS pharyngitis diagnosis should be based on microbiological testing, clinical algorithm or a combination of both. On the other hand, some European guidelines consider GAS pharyngitis to be a mild, self-limiting disease that does not require a specific diagnosis or antimicrobial treatment except in high-risk patients. There is an agreement among guidelines that if antibiotic therapy is indicated, phenoxymethyl penicillin should be the drug of choice to treat GAS pharyngitis.","publish_time":"2013-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazur, El\u017Cbieta","journal":"Cent Eur J Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ae49eec2fbd867ef9acd8f104719171df220b6e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2478/s11536-013-0216-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["European and North American"],"locations":["North America","Europe"],"keyphrases":["acute GAS pharyngitis diagnosis","management of acute pharyngitis","cases of acute pharyngitis","form of acute pharyngitis","European guidelines","international guidelines","North American guidelines","antimicrobial treatment","antibiotic therapy","specific diagnosis","aim","principal bacterial pathogen of acute sore throat","unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions","viral etiology","Streptococcus pyogenes","scientific societies","scientific evidence","respected advisory bodies","different approaches","microbiological testing","state","opinions","art","phenoxymethyl penicillin","drug of choice","clinical algorithm","group","antibiotics","origin","high-risk patients","combination","review work","self-limiting disease","agreement","hand","differentiation"],"language":"en"},

The annual concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 \u03BCm (PM10), ranging from 141 to 166 \u03BCg m\u22123 in 2000\u20132004, could be very harmful to human health. In this paper, we presented the mortality and morbidity effects of PM10 pollution based on statistical data and the epidemiological exposure\u2013response function. The economic costs to health during the 5 years were estimated to lie between US$1670 and $3655 million annually, accounting for about 6.55% of Beijing\u0027s gross domestic product each year. The total costs were apportioned into two parts caused by: the local emissions and long-range transported pollution. The contribution from local emissions dominated the total costs, accounting on average for 3.60% of GDP. However, the contributions from transported pollution cannot be neglected, and the relative percentage to the total costs from the other regions could account for about 45%. An energy policy and effective measures should be proposed to reduce particulate matter, especially PM2.5 pollution in Beijing to protect public health. The Beijing government also needs to cooperate with the other local governments to reduce high background level of particulate air pollution.","publish_time":"2007-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Minsi; Song, Yu; Cai, Xuhui","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc92199f668f16ab7778d221c4c195a131649bf9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119316.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969707001544; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969707001544","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["total costs","Abstract Particulate air pollution","long-range transported pollution","high background level of particulate air pollution","local emissions","morbidity effects of PM10 pollution","economic costs","annual concentration of particulate matter","local governments","public health","human health","accounting","Beijing government","statistical data","aerodynamic diameter","serious problem","epidemiological exposure","mortality","Beijing\u0027s gross domestic product","average","parts","PM2","response function","effective measures","energy policy","\u03BCm","years","relative percentage","contributions","regions","GDP","paper","\u03BCg"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao(2)) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao(2)) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir\u2013ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, \u22125.8 percentage points; 95% CI, \u221217.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

In contrast, many of them contain antibodies against bat HKU8-related (HKU8r)-CoVs.

These findings may indicate co-infection with MERS-CoV and a HKU8r-CoV in camels. It may also raise the possibility of the circulation of a recombinant coronavirus virus with the spike of MERS-CoV and the NP of a HKU8r-CoV in Kenya.

In this study, the immunogenicity of the SL-CoV S protein (SSL) was studied and compared with that of SARS-CoV (SSARS). DNA immunization in mice with SSL elicited a high titer of antibodies against HIV-pseudotyped SSL. The sera had low cross-reactivity, but no neutralization activity, for the HIV-pseudotyped SSARS. Studies using wild bat sera revealed that it is highly likely that the immunodominant epitopes overlap with the major neutralizing sites of the SL-CoV S protein.

To identify sequence changes responsible for the attenuation of IBV, complete genome sequences of both virulent and attenuated Ark DPI viruses were obtained. Comparison of the genome sequences of the virulent and attenuated Ark DPI viruses reveals that these viruses are similar and differ only by 21 nucleotides, resulting in 17 amino acids changes.

At the endpoint, all mice were challenged intraperitoneally with OVM and alum. Type-1 hypersensitivity was confirmed in OVM-sensitized mice by observation of clinical signs of anaphylaxis and elevated levels of plasma histamine, OVM-specific IgE and OVM-specific IgG by ELISA. Differential protein expression was assessed in albumin-depleted plasma as well as in mesenteric lymph node, liver, spleen, and ileum by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Differentially expressed proteins were identified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma proteins overexpressed in OVM-sensitized mice included haptoglobin (41-fold), serum amyloid A (19-fold) and peroxiredoxin-2 (1.9-fold).

Although previous studies have reported that the training of individual leaders is an important approach, the systemic and scientific training model need further improvement and development. The purpose of this study was to develop, deliver, and evaluate a participatory leadership training program for emergency response. METHODS: Forty-one public health leaders (N = 41) from five provinces completed the entire emergency preparedness training program in China. The program was evaluated by anonymous questionnaires and semi-structured interviews held prior to training, immediately post-training and 12-month after training (Follow-up). RESULTS: The emergency preparedness training resulted in positive shifts in knowledge, self-assessment of skills for public health leaders. More than ninety-five percent of participants reported that the training model was scientific and feasible. Moreover, the response of participants in the program to the avian influenza outbreak, as well as the planned evaluations for this leadership training program, further demonstrated both the successful approaches and methods and the positive impact of this integrated leadership training initiative. CONCLUSION: The emergency preparedness training program met its aims and objectives satisfactorily, and improved the emergency capability of public health leaders. This suggests that the leadership training model was effective and feasible in improving the emergency preparedness capability.","publish_time":"2008-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chongjian; Wei, Sheng; Xiang, Hao; Wu, Jing; Xu, Yihua; Liu, Li; Nie, Shaofa","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b41f3634a764bf08cbc4588f37d7d422a02fa541.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2605461.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-8-377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18973664/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["post-training","leadership training model","training of individual leaders","entire emergency preparedness training program","scientific training model","participatory leadership training program","integrated leadership training initiative","emergency capability of public health leaders","emergency preparedness capability","emergency response","able public health leaders","public health emergencies","METHODS","response of participants","positive impact","positive shifts","development of qualified","percent of participants","self-assessment of skills","SARS","knowledge","important approach","severe acute respiratory syndrome","semi-structured interviews","attack","anonymous questionnaires","infrastructure","provinces","aims","China","new urgency","planned evaluations","successful approaches","month","improvement","objectives","CONCLUSION","avian influenza outbreak","RESULTS","previous studies","Follow-up","purpose","study","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

We developed a portable airborne particle-collection system to measure the viral load; it is equipped with an air sampler to draw air and pass it through a gelatin membrane filter connected to a cone-shaped, megaphone-like device to guide the cough airflow to the membrane. The membrane was dissolved in a medium, and the viral load was measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and a plaque assay. The approximate viral recovery rate of this system was 10% in simulation experiments to collect and quantify the viral particles aerosolized by a nebulizer. Using this system, cough samples were collected from 56 influenza A patients. The total viral detection rate was 41% (23/56), and the viral loads varied significantly (from \u003C10, less than the detection limit, to 2240 viral gene copies/cough). Viable viruses were detected from 3 samples with \u226418 plaque forming units per cough sample. The virus detection rates were similar among different groups of patients infected with different viral subtypes and during different influenza seasons. Among patients who did not receive antiviral treatment, viruses were detected in one of six cases in the vaccinated group and four of six cases in the unvaccinated group. We found cases with high viral titers in throat swabs or oral secretions but very low or undetectable in coughs and vice versa suggesting other possible anatomical sites where the viruses might be mixed into the cough. Our system is easy to operate, appropriate for bedside use, and is useful for comparing the viral load in cough samples from influenza patients under various conditions and settings.

The study comprised 67 patients with skin or mucous membrane lesions suggestive of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The sensitivity of EM increased 25% after virus concentration by ultracentrifugation. Herpes virus infection was confirmed in 55 of the 67 cases by EM or VC or both. EM detected 53 herpes virus-positive lesion samples of which 14 were not detected by VC; only two lesion samples that were herpes virus-positive in VC were not detected by EM. The sensitivities of EM, VC, and Tzanck smear for the group of 55 herpes virus-positive cases were 96%, 75% and 76%, respectively. The specificity of the Tzanck smear was 83% (prevalence 82%). Colloidal gold immuno-EM was used to rapidly type HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV) present in skin and mucous membrane lesions in less than 4 h. Immuno-EM was able to detect antiviral antibodies on viral envelopes and viral cores in lesion samples with negative VC. Antiviral antibodies do not interfere with typing of herpes viruses by immuno-EM. It is suggested that formation of viral immune complexes and inactivation of virus particles by antibodies may have caused a negative VC. Improved EM is discussed for its applicability to special cases that cannot rely on VC and cytodiagnosis or when rapid diagnosis is required.","publish_time":"1991-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Folkers, E.; Vreeswijk, Joh.; Oranje, A.

However, such systems were based on subjective judgment, rather than statistical methods, to weight scores. Data from a pair-matched case-control study on a California calf raising facility was used to develop three novel scoring systems to diagnose BRD in preweaned dairy calves. Disease status was assigned using both clinical signs and diagnostic test results for BRD-associated pathogens. Regression coefficients were used to weight score values. The systems presented use nasal and ocular discharge, rectal temperature, ear and head carriage, coughing, and respiratory quality as predictors. The systems developed in this research utilize fewer severity categories of clinical signs, require less calf handling, and had excellent agreement (Kappa \u003E 0.8) when compared to an earlier scoring system. The first scoring system dichotomized all clinical predictors but required inducing a cough. The second scoring system removed induced cough as a clinical abnormality but required distinguishing between three levels of nasal discharge severity. The third system removed induced cough and forced a dichotomized variable for nasal discharge. The first system presented in this study used the following predictors and assigned values: coughing (induced or spontaneous coughing, 2 points), nasal discharge (any discharge, 3 points), ocular discharge (any discharge, 2 points), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (\u226539.2\u00B0C or 102.5\u00B0F, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal respiration, 2 points). Calves were categorized \u201CBRD positive\u201D if their total score was \u22654. This system correctly classified 95.4% cases and 88.6% controls. The second presented system categorized the predictors and assigned weights as follows: coughing (spontaneous only, 2 points), mild nasal discharge (unilateral, serous, or watery discharge, 3 points), moderate to severe nasal discharge (bilateral, cloudy, mucoid, mucopurlent, or copious discharge, 5 points), ocular discharge (any discharge, 1 point), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (\u226539.2\u00B0C, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal respiration, 2 points). Calves were categorized \u201CBRD positive\u201D if their total score was \u22654. This system correctly classified 89.3% cases and 92.8% controls. The third presented system used the following predictors and scores: coughing (spontaneous only, 2 points), nasal discharge (any, 4 points), ocular discharge (any, 2 points), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (\u226539.2\u00B0C, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal respiration, 2 points). Calves were categorized \u201CBRD positive\u201D if their total score was \u22655. This system correctly classified 89.4% cases and 90.8% controls. Each of the proposed systems offer few levels of clinical signs and data-based weights for on-farm diagnosis of BRD in dairy calves.","publish_time":"2014-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Love, William J.; Lehenbauer, Terry W.; Kass, Philip H.; Van Eenennaam, Alison L.; Aly, Sharif S.","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b2e83d49677c03c836133b83b909f5db0423cc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3898311.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482759/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.238","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRD"],"locations":["California"],"keyphrases":["points","ocular discharge","copious discharge","watery discharge","severe nasal discharge","mild nasal discharge","presented system","levels of nasal discharge severity","clinical scoring systems","head carriage","clinical predictors","earlier scoring system","ear droop","head tilt","BRD positive","respiratory quality","novel scoring systems","spontaneous coughing","proposed systems","levels of clinical signs","clinical abnormality","following predictors","total score","farm diagnosis of BRD","BRD-associated pathogens","abnormal respiration","induced cough","preweaned dairy calves","score values","fever","cases","controls","fewer severity categories of clinical signs","diagnosis of bovine respiratory disease","data-based weights","weight scores","California calf","calf handling","Disease status","dichotomized variable","pair-matched case-control study","diagnostic test results","rectal temperature","statistical methods","mucopurlent","research","distinguishing","excellent agreement","facility","subjective judgment","Regression coefficients","Kappa"],"language":"en"},

Using cross-reactive antibodies, we report the phenotypic and functional characterization of T cell subsets, B and NK cells in the fruit-eating bat Pteropus alecto. Our findings indicate the predominance of CD8(\u002B) T cells in the spleen from wild-caught bats that may reflect either the presence of viruses in this organ or predominance of this cell subset at steady state. Instead majority of T cells in circulation, lymph nodes and bone marrow (BM) were CD4(\u002B) subsets. Interestingly, 40% of spleen T cells expressed constitutively IL-17, IL-22 and TGF-\u03B2 mRNA, which may indicate a strong bias towards the Th17 and regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, the unexpected high number of T cells in bats BM could suggest an important role in T cell development. Finally, mitogenic stimulation induced proliferation and production of effector molecules by bats immune cells.

Results: Different epidemic strength and strategies of disease control and prevention resulted in different levels of medical resource request, and active control strategy and effective measures could significantly decrease the requirement. During the epidemic rising phase, the cost of prevention and control measures and the requirement of professional response capacities would increase with potential high risk of medical resource demand sharply increasing.

Though murine models have been instrumental in understanding the functional role of MIF in different pathological conditions, the information obtained from these models is biased towards a specific species. In experimental science, results obtained from multiple clinically relevant animal models always provide convincing data that might recapitulate in humans. Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), is a clinically relevant animal model for multiple human diseases. Hence, the major objectives of this study were to characterize the structure and function of Mesocricetus auratus MIF (MaMIF) and finally evaluate its effect on pancreatic tumor growth in vivo. Initially, the recombinant MaMIF was cloned, expressed and purified in a bacterial expression system. The MaMIF primary sequence, biochemical properties, and crystal structure analysis showed greater similarity with human MIF. The crystal structure of MaMIF illustrates that it forms a homotrimer as known in human and mouse. However, MaMIF exhibits some minor structural variations when compared to human and mouse MIF. The in vitro functional studies show that MaMIF has tautomerase activity and enhances activation and migration of hamster peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Interestingly, injection of MaMIF into HapT1 pancreatic tumor-bearing hamsters significantly enhanced the tumor growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis. Together, the current study shows a structural and functional similarity between the hamster and human MIF. Moreover, it has demonstrated that a high level of circulating MIF originating from non-tumor cells might also promote pancreatic tumor growth in vivo.","publish_time":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suresh, Voddu; Sundaram, Rajivgandhi; Dash, Pujarini; Sabat, Surendra Chandra; Mohapatra, Debasish; Mohanty, Sneha; Vasudevan, Dileep; Senapati, Shantibhusan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a2a859f5920d1a81d0ab2e619f00f729331fedc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6820718.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6820718/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Macrophage","MIF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human MIF","mouse MIF","pancreatic tumor growth","crystal structure of MaMIF","injection of MaMIF","recombinant MaMIF","functional role of MIF","HapT1 pancreatic tumor","non-tumor cells","function of Mesocricetus auratus MIF","multiple human diseases","MaMIF primary sequence","tumor-associated angiogenesis","functional similarity","high level of circulating MIF","relevant animal models","crystal structure analysis","functional studies","murine models","migration of hamster peripheral blood mononuclear cells","Syrian golden hamster","greater similarity","current study","inflammatory diseases","minor structural variations","Macrophage migration inhibitory factor","biochemical properties","activation","different pathological conditions","tautomerase activity","PBMCs","results","convincing data","hamsters","information","effect","experimental science","homotrimer","pleiotropic cytokine","bacterial expression system","humans","major objectives","cancers","specific species"],"language":"en"},

Many of these have focused on donor and laboratory\u2010based screening for transfusion\u2010transmitted diseases, as evidenced by the hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus screening in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. More recently, this effort has expanded to develop donor screening assays to identify other blood\u2010borne pathogens, such as Zika and West Nile viruses and Babesia. Bacterial contamination of units of platelets (PLTs), however, remains a significant concern. In recent years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved rapid tests to identify bacterially contaminated PLT units in the blood bank before transfusion. Other supplemental methods have been developed, however, that aim to inactivate blood\u2010borne pathogen(s) present in the blood product, rather than to rely on our ability to identify and interdict contaminated and infected components.

Pharmacy professionals are considered essential partners in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Community and hospital pharmacies are expanding services and hours to provide essential services, putting pharmacists and their co-workers at the frontlines for patient care and safety to improve public health. In addition, pharmacy professionals are increasingly integrating into global, national, state and local EP\u0026R efforts, including into interprofessional teams, such as Medical Reserve Corps (MRCs). However, lacunae exist for further integration of pharmacists into public health and safety initiatives. There are increasing opportunities and recommendations that should be expanded upon to provide improved patient care and population health intervention, and to ensure healthcare worker and public health safety. Objective Develop a Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response (PEPR) Framework and recommendations for pharmacy professional pathways towards full integration within public health EP\u0026R efforts (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and enhanced recognition of pharmacists\u2019 skills, roles and contributions as integral members of the interprofessional healthcare team. Methods This paper draws on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) 2003 Statement on the Role of Health-System Pharmacists in Emergency Preparedness and lessons learned from previous and current public health emergencies, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic, to provide expanded guidance for pharmacists and pharmacy professionals across all practice settings in EP\u0026R. The PEPR framework also incorporates information and recommendations from The Pharmacy Organizations\u2019 Joint Policy Recommendations to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic (March 2020), CDC-NIOSH, Health Departments and Emergency Preparedness guidance and resources, Boards of Pharmacy, and other pharmacy professional organizations and educational institutions. Results Based on the methods and resources utilized in developing this PEPR framework, five key focus areas were identified as follow: 1) Emergency preparedness and response 2) Operations management 3) Patient care and population health interventions 4) Public health pharmacy education and continuing professional education 5) Evaluation, research and dissemination for impact and outcomes Conclusion and Recommendations: Pharmacists and pharmacy professionals have been at the frontlines in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, challenges remain, such as limited availability of personal protection equipment, high risk of infectious exposures inherent in healthcare professions, and legislative hurdles resulting in lack of provider status and related reimbursements. Recommendations to enhance pharmacy\u0027s scope as public health professionals involved in EP\u0026R include targeted training and education on key framework areas and policymaking. Pharmacy professionals should further integrate with interdisciplinary public health teams. Additional research and dissemination on impacts and outcomes of EP\u0026R can enhance recognition of pharmacy professionals\u0027 contribution and value during public health emergencies. The PEPR Framework can be utilized to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate results in order to strengthen existing efforts and to establish new initiatives in EP\u0026R.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aruru, Meghana; Truong, Hoai-An; Clark, Suzanne","journal":"Res Social Adm Pharm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de0e1b2300d7d53f57df9c64ab5a193c9eb96a8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146711.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120303235?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389631/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551741120303235","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Medical Reserve Corps","Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response","Health-System Pharmacists in Emergency Preparedness","PEPR","The Pharmacy Organizations\u2019 Joint Policy","CDC","Health Departments and Emergency Preparedness","Operations"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health EP","public health professionals","Public health pharmacy education","public health safety","Health Departments","Role of Health","Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness","current public health emergencies","interdisciplinary public health teams","Boards of Pharmacy","population health interventions","American Society of Health","pharmacy professional pathways","pharmacy professional organizations","System Pharmacists","integration of pharmacists","outcomes of EP","PEPR framework","Pharmacy Organizations\u2019 Joint Policy Recommendations","R efforts","Emergency Preparedness guidance","recognition of pharmacy professionals\u0027 contribution","response","local EP","current COVID","H1N1 pandemic","professional education","key framework areas","Abstract Background Pharmacists","safety initiatives","ongoing COVID","medication safety","improved patient care","healthcare professions","healthcare worker","interprofessional healthcare team","existing efforts","dissemination","essential services","resources","interprofessional teams","expanded guidance","frontlines","Results","Methods","key focus areas","outcomes Conclusion","essential partners","Additional research","new initiatives","enhanced recognition of pharmacists\u2019 skills","high risk of infectious exposures inherent","roles","value","lessons","limited availability of personal protection equipment","integral members","targeted training","contributions","legislative hurdles","lack of provider status","impacts","Operations management","vaccinations","access","natural disasters","hours","Evaluation","ASHP","Statement","co-workers","Medical Reserve Corps","information","practice settings","pharmacy\u0027s scope","CDC-NIOSH","screening","related reimbursements","hospital pharmacies","preventive measures","educational institutions","policymaking","pharmaceutical countermeasures","MRCs","pandemics","Community","paper","order","Objective","challenges","lacunae","opportunities"],"language":"en"},

Vietnam has a large number of LBMs reflecting the consumer preferences for live poultry. Under pressure to mitigate risks for H7N9 and other zoonotic AIs, Vietnam is considering, among other mitigation measures, temporary closures of LBMs as a policy to reduce risk of AI outbreaks. However, the efficacy of market closure is debated, particularly because little is known about how poultry traders may react, and whether trading may emerge outside formal marketplaces. Combining efforts of anthropologists, economists, sociologists, and veterinarians can be useful to elucidate the drivers behind poultry traders\u2019 reactions and better understanding the barriers to implementing risk mitigation measures. In this paper, we present results from a stakeholder survey of LBM stakeholders in Vietnam. Our qualitative data show that trading outside formal markets is very likely to occur in the event of a temporary LBM market closure. Our data show that the poultry value chain in Vietnam remains highly flexible, with traders willing and able to trade poultry in many possible locations. Our results indicate that simplification of the poultry value chain along with strict enforcement, engagement of stakeholders, and adequate communication would be a necessary prerequisite before market closure could be an effective policy.","publish_time":"2017-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Thi Thanh Thuy; Fearnley, Lyle; Dinh, Xuan Tung; Tran, Thi Tram Anh; Tran, Trong Tung; Nguyen, Van Trong; Tago, Damian; Padungtod, Pawin; Newman, Scott H.; Tripodi, Astrid","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17fe16cf66ebbe693a2e75dda11d14513fec7519.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5572285.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28879203/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2017.00136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["Vietnam","live poultry","poultry value chain","poultry traders\u2019 reactions","temporary LBM market closure","efficacy of market closure","zoonotic AIs","temporary closures of LBMs","trading","formal markets","risk mitigation measures","H7N9","large number of LBMs","live bird markets","engagement of stakeholders","stakeholder survey of LBM stakeholders","effective policy","present results","traders willing","qualitative data","formal marketplaces","risk of AI outbreaks","zoonotic transmission of avian influenzas","ecology","strict enforcement","consumer preferences","sociologists","adequate communication","barriers","necessary prerequisite","significant role","event","economists","H5N1","drivers","risks","simplification","efforts of anthropologists","veterinarians","possible locations","paper","pressure","Extensive research"],"language":"en"},

The chylomicron-associated drug is then secreted from the enterocyte into the lymphatic circulation, rather than the portal circulation, thus avoiding the metabolically-active liver, but still ultimately returning to the systemic circulation. Because of this parallel and potentially alternative absorptive pathway, first-pass metabolism can be reduced while increasing lymphatic drug exposure, which opens the potential for novel therapeutic modalities and allows the implementation of lipid-based drug delivery systems. This review discusses the physiological features of the lymphatics, enterocyte uptake and metabolism, links between drug transport and lipid digestion/re-acylation, experimental model (in vivo, in vitro, and in silico) of lymphatic transport, and the design of lipid- or prodrug-based drug delivery systems for enhancing lymphatic drug transport.","publish_time":"2011-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Y\u00E1\u00F1ez, Jaime A.; Wang, Stephen W.J.; Knemeyer, Ian W.; Wirth, Mark A.; Alton, Kevin B.","journal":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5c4ae5b84850a4bb16176839d6ca516c224a80c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126116.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21689702/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169409X11001414; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2011.05.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X11001414","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lymphatic drug transport","lymphatic drug exposure","lymphatic circulation","Abstract Intestinal lymphatic transport","intestinal enterocyte","chylomicron-associated drug","prodrug-based drug delivery systems","enterocyte uptake","lipid digestion","implementation of lipid","design of lipid","metabolism","secretable enterocyte lipoproteins","portal circulation","systemic circulation","alternative absorptive pathway","increasing number of lipophilic drugs","links","re-acylation","oral administration of lipids","transit associate","potential","lymphatics","experimental model","physiological features","novel therapeutic modalities","review","silico","active liver"],"language":"en"},

However, differences in severity between these pathogens have been noted, suggesting the degree of illness may vary in different populations. Moreover, a potential association between hMPV and asthma also suggests that hMPV may preferentially affect asthmatic subjects. METHODS: In a population-based surveillance study in children aged \u003C2 years admitted for severe LRTI in Argentina, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested by RT-PCR for hMPV, RSV, influenza A, and human rhinovirus. RESULTS: Of 3947 children, 383 (10%) were infected with hMPV. The hospitalization rate for hMPV LRTI was 2.26 per 1000 children (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04\u20132.49). Thirty-nine (10.2%) patients infected with hMPV experienced life-threatening disease (LTD; 0.23 per 1000 children; 95% CI, .16\u2013.31/1000), and 2 died (mortality rate 0.024 per 1000; 95% CI, .003\u2013.086). In hMPV-infected children birth to an asthmatic mother was an increased risk for LTD (odds ratio, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.39\u201316.01). We observed a specific interaction between maternal asthma and hMPV infection affecting risk for LTD.

Patients and methods: this is a comparative analysis of the experience of two Centres, with different plasma products, to evaluate their efficacy in TTP. One centre used quarantine plasma (QP), and MBP the other. We performed a retrospective longitudinal study, analysing the clinical files of TTP patients of a 13-year data evaluation period. Duration of treatment and transfusion parameters, medical record, laboratory testing, concomitant medication, and survival rate, were assessed for every episode. RESULTS: During the study period, 12 (55.5 %) and 10 (45.5 %) new cases were treated with QP and MBP, respectively. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of TPE processes, days elapsed from diagnosis to TPE, and plasma volume transfused. The QP TPE episodes of treatment were significantly associated with an increased time to recovery compared with MBP episodes of treatment (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: MBP was as effective as QP in the treatment of TTP patients. Since recovery was more favourable when MBP was used, we consider MBP remains a suitable alternative to treat TTP patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodr\u00EDguez, Jos\u00E9 L.

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) released from the airway epithelium in response to damage, has been suggested as a link between viral infection and type 2 inflammation, but the role of TSLP in asthma exacerbations is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether type 2 inflammation, as measured by sputum eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), is a feature of naturally occurring virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and whether TSLP is associated with this type 2 inflammation. METHODS: Patients presenting to hospital with acute asthma were examined during the exacerbation, and after 4 weeks recovery. The assessments included spirometry, FeNO and induced sputum for differential counts and TSLP mRNA levels. Nasal swabs were collected for viral detection. RESULTS: Sputum eosinophils and FeNO were similar between virus-positive (n=44) and negative patients (n=44). In virus-positive patients, TSLP expression was lower at exacerbation than follow-up (p=0.03). High TSLP at exacerbation was associated with lower sputum eosinophils (p=0.01) and higher FEV1 (p=0.03). In virus-positive patients, %-predicted FEV1 negatively correlated with both FeNO and sputum eosinophils (p=0.02 and p=0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings support that type 2 inflammation is present in patients during virus-induced asthma exacerbations, to the same degree as non-viral exacerbations, and correlate negatively with FEV1. However, in virus-positive patients, high TSLP expression during exacerbation was associated with low sputum eosinophils, suggesting that the effect of TSLP in vivo, in the setting of an asthma exacerbation, might be different than the type 2 inducing effects observed in experimental studies.","publish_time":"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bjerregaard, Asger; Laing, Ingrid A.; Poulsen, Nadia; Backer, Vibeke; Sverrild, Asger; Fally, Markus; Khoo, Siew-Kim; Barrett, Lucy; Baltic, Svetlana; Thompson, Philip J.; Chidlow, Glenys; Sikazwe, Chisha; Smith, David W; Bochkov, Yury A.; Le Sou\u00EBf, Peter; Porsbjerg, Celeste","journal":"Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c649437f7c285ccdb83bc52f752568104175bf13.json; document_parses/pdf_json/96469dc40f2a6b0bd4a9727943d9d47cd1d6be03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5462105.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611116303389; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611116303389; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2016.12.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28137494/; http://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954611116303389/pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TSLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["type","virus-positive patients","virus-induced asthma exacerbations","virus-induced exacerbations of asthma","induced sputum","inflammation","role of TSLP","effect of TSLP","lower sputum eosinophils","FeNO","high TSLP expression","low sputum eosinophils","negative patients","acute asthma","TSLP mRNA levels","non-viral exacerbations","viral detection","experimental studies viral infections","predicted FEV1","higher FEV1","feature","differential counts","fractional exhaled nitric oxide","degree","airway epithelium","BACKGROUND","effects","hospital","spirometry","follow-up","response","damage","Nasal swabs","Thymic stromal lymphopoietin","assessments","link","findings","RESULTS","setting","weeks recovery","CONCLUSION","METHODS","asthmatics","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

However, several issues remain to be systematically evaluated due to the lack of clinical trials. Few studies have compared different antibiotic treatment strategies and outcomes. Nursing home residents with pneumonia are frequently hospitalized and these transfers are associated with the multiple hazards of hospitalization as well as with economic costs.

The S protein is a potent target for SARS-specific cell-mediated immune responses. However, the mechanism CoV pathogenesis in SARS and the role of special CTLs in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe a study that leads to the identification of a novel HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope from conserved regions of S protein. RESULTS: First, different SARS-CoV sequences were analyzed to predict eight candidate peptides from conserved regions of the S protein based upon HLA-A*0201 binding and proteosomal cleavage. Four of eight candidate peptides were tested by HLA-A*0201 binding assays. Among the four candidate peptides, Sp8 (S(958-966), VLNDILSRL) induced specific CTLs both ex vivo in PBLs of healthy HLA-A2(\u002B )donors and in HLA-A2.1/K(b )transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding full-length S protein. The immunized mice released IFN-\u03B3 and lysed target cells upon stimulation with Sp8 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in comparison to other candidates. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Sp8 is a naturally processed epitope. We propose that Sp8 epitope should help in the characterization of mechanisms of virus control and immunopathology in SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2009-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Yanbo; Ruan, Zhihua; Wang, Li; Ni, Bing; Wu, Yuzhang","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2792222.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2172-10-61; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19958537/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["full-length S protein","conserved regions of S protein","Sp8 epitope","SARS-CoV infection","novel HLA","candidate peptides","different SARS-CoV sequences","SARS-specific cell","Sp8 peptide","PBLs of healthy HLA-A2","specific CTLs","mechanism CoV pathogenesis","restricted epitope","immunized mice","processed epitope","RESULTS","lysed target cells","potent target","virus control","virus clearance","transgenic mice","binding assays","autologous dendritic cells","role of special CTLs","stimulation","IFN-\u03B3","causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","ex","immunopathology","major structural glycoprotein of coronavirus","plasmid","characterization of mechanisms","comparison","donors","immune responses","candidates","identification","VLNDILSRL","spike","proteosomal cleavage","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","study"],"language":"en"},

We find that the lack of reflection by scientists about the framing under which they operate appears as a major factor of misunderstanding between disciplines, and a barrier for inter- and trans-disciplinary solutions to improve management of health risks and benefits. Hence, to build such solutions, framing will have to be a conscious and repeated step in the process, acknowledging and explaining the diversity of viewpoints and values.

We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model\u2019s behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks.

When the prophylactic treatment was given at 56 days prior to infection, it protected 90% of animals from death (100% protection for treatments given between 1\u201349 days pre-infection), with minimal weight loss occurring during infection. Surviving animals re-challenged with virus 22 days after the primary infection were protected from death, indicating that mDEF201 did not compromise the immune response against the initial infection. Post-exposure therapy was given between 6\u201324 h after vaccinia virus exposure and protection was afforded by a 10(8) dose of mDEF201 given at 24 h, whereas a 10(7) dose was effective up to 12 h.

Lung, liver, and spleen virus titers were inhibited to nearly the same extent by either treatment, as were lung weights and lung hemorrhage scores (indicators of pneumonitis). Lung virus titers were significantly (\u003E100-fold) lower than in the placebo group, and the other infection parameters in mDEF201 treated mice were nearly at baseline. In contrast, viral titers and lung infection parameters were high in the placebo group on day 5 of the infection.

Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed. However, transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection. Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as a primary infection disease control measure. However, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS. The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions of from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, for example, also suggested airborne transmission. Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities HVAC systems.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Correia, G.; Rodrigues, L.; Silva, MG.; Gon\u00E7alves, T.","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73b09458f180f11b782304353cffbb3c40479541.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182754.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030698772030801X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109781; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698772030801X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO","Air Conditioning Systems","SARS","HVAC","Diamond Princess"],"locations":["Japan","Germany","Amoy Gardens"],"keyphrases":["airborne transmission","aerosol transmission","person transmission","way of transmission","transmission mechanisms","airborne route","airborne diseases","facilities HVAC systems","SARS-CoV","corona virus","Air Conditioning Systems","Previous SARS outbreaks","primary infection disease control measure","unprecedent worldwide measures","Amoy Gardens","structural changes","hospital","Emergency Rooms","Germany","Hotels","disseminated use of masks","Ventilating","example","procedures","support treatments","pandemic of unseen proportions","Diamond Princess Cruise Ship","mask usage","best intervention","Heating","major shift","hypotheses","Japan","aerosols","descriptions","assumption","past","authors","Summary","evidence","studies","contagion"],"language":"en"},

The common characteristic is usually genome size as small RNA viruses are typically sequenced in vastly greater numbers and are much less complex than the large DNA viruses; they have variability at the level of SNPs rather than gene presence/absence. Here, we present the basics of database organization and aim to compare and contrast these features and the manner by which the databases are used by the scientific community.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"McLeod, Kathleen; Upton, Chris","journal":"Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03476153a6c18a85c98721c557f35b1a09755d14.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128012383957283; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383957283","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["simple databases","Abstract Databases","collection of virus databases","scientific literature","scientific endeavours","scientific community","protein sequence databases","ever-growing mountains of scientific data","large DNA viruses","common characteristic","greater numbers","virus families","common theme","small RNA viruses","greater diversity of purpose","researchers","performing BLAST searches","genome size","variability","access","level of SNPs","gene presence","absence","molecular virology","email","funding","specific task","respects","basics of database organization","manner","features"],"language":"en"},

Yet, up to now, there has been a lack of synthetic data that clearly demonstrates the incidence of respiratory viral infections in adult patients with CAP. OBJECTIVES: We intended to demonstrate the incidence of respiratory viral infections detected by PCR and real-time PCR in adult patients with CAP. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies providing the incidence of respiratory viral infections in adult patients with CAP. We investigated potential sources of heterogeneity by a univariant metaregression analysis and calculated the combined incidence of viral infections, viral infections mixed with other pathogens and individual respiratory virus species. RESULTS: We eventually identified 23 eligible reports with a total number of 6,404 patients. Incidences ranged from 8.6 to 56.2% for overall respiratory viral infections. We noted significant heterogeneity in incidence estimates for the incidence of viral infections (Cochran\u0027s \u03C7(2) = 269.9, p \u003C 0.0001, I(2) = 91.8%). The combined incidence of viral infections was 22.4% (95% CI = 19.0-25.7). Incidences of viral coinfections with other pathogens ranged from 3 to 28%. A high level of heterogeneity was identified as well during the estimates for incidences of coinfections (\u03C7(2) = 200.9, p \u003C 0.0001, I(2) = 91.5%). The combined incidence of viral coinfections with other pathogens was 12.4% (95% CI = 9.7-15.0). Our heterogeneity analyses suggested that a lower respiratory tract sample was associated with higher overall viral incidence. Moreover, the influenza virus, rhinovirus and coronavirus were the 3 most frequently detected viral pathogens in adult patients with CAP according to our study. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are probably crucial pathogens of adult patients with CAP, with the influenza virus being the most frequent viral pathogen identified. More than half of the viral infections are characterized as mixed infections with other pathogens.","publish_time":"2015-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Xiaodong; Wang, Qin; Wang, Min; Su, Xin; Xing, Zheng; Zhang, Weiyun; Shi, Yi","journal":"Respiration","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40f7b162fb74bd044f4eb05cdce48a1d1c6018b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25791384/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000369561","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral incidence","incidence of respiratory viral infections","viral pathogens","combined incidence of viral infections","contributions of respiratory viral infections","combined incidence of viral coinfections","Incidences of viral coinfections","mixed infections","frequent viral pathogen","incidence estimates","crucial pathogens of adult patients","Respiratory viruses","individual respiratory virus species","CAP","incidences of coinfections","lower respiratory tract sample","influenza virus","heterogeneity analyses","significant heterogeneity","PCR techniques","real-time PCR","potential sources of heterogeneity","high level of heterogeneity","Cochran\u0027s \u03C7","sensitive detection methods","community","pneumonia","univariant metaregression analysis","studies","development","total number","Embase","eligible reports","PubMed","rhinovirus","coronavirus","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","lack of synthetic data","study","half","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, these species, all of which belong to the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, inject various kinds of virus-like particles. The most studied of these particles are classified as polydnaviruses (family Polydnaviridae) which are symbiotic viruses. Over the past decade, it has also been shown that several wasp species harbour reoviruses (family Reoviridae), and that two of these suppress host defence, allowing the development of the parasitoid eggs. In this paper, we summarize the key features of these viruses and their relationships with their wasp hosts. Five reoviruses are known that appear to be non-pathogenic for the wasps. Three of these, McRVLP, HeRV, OpRVLP, use their wasp hosts as vectors, and do not appear to be involved in host defence suppression. The fourth, DpRV-1, is a commensal reovirus detected in most field populations of the wasp, Diadromus pulchellus. This reovirus is always found associated with an ascovirus, DpAV-4a, which is indispensable for host immune suppression. Although DpRV-1 has not been shown to directly increase D. pulchellus parasitic success, it may contribute to this success by retarding DpAV-4a replication in the wasp. The fifth reovirus, DpRV-2, occurs in a specific population of D. pulchellus in which DpRV-1 and DpAV-4 are absent. This virus has a mutualistic relationship with its wasp host, as its injection by females during oviposition is essential for host immunosuppression. Interestingly, these viruses belong to several different reovirus genera.","publish_time":"2005-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Renault, Sylvaine; Stasiak, Karine; Federici, Brian; Bigot, Yves","journal":"Journal of Insect Physiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29d0cbb020ed6a7281aa6bd957cb44f064295070.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127831.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022191004001441; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022191004001441","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wasp hosts","DpRV","host defence suppression","host immunosuppression","DpAV","wasp species harbour reoviruses","host immune suppression","commensal reovirus","symbiotic viruses","particles","Diadromus pulchellus","defence systems","different reovirus genera","pulchellus parasitic success","family Reoviridae","family Polydnaviridae","various kinds of virus","certain endoparasitoid wasps","field populations","Braconidae","oviposition","mechanisms","females","injection","Abstract","evolution","development","OpRVLP","relationships","mutualistic relationship","families Ichneumonidae","key features","polydnaviruses","HeRV","specific population of","parasitoid eggs","paper","McRVLP","replication","vectors","past decade","purpose","ascovirus"],"language":"en"},

Many chiropractic institutions, associations, and researchers have stepped up at a time of need. However, a subset of the chiropractic profession has claimed that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is clinically effective in improving one\u2019s immunity, despite the lack of supporting scientific evidence. These unsubstantiated claims contradict official public health policy reflecting poorly on the profession. The aim of this commentary is to provide our perspective on the claims regarding SMT and clinically relevant immunity enhancement, drawing attention to the damaging ramifications these claims might have on our profession\u2019s reputation. MAIN TEXT: The World Federation of Chiropractic released a rapid review demonstrating the lack of clinically relevant evidence regarding SMT and immunity enhancement. The current claims contradicting this review carry significant potential risk to patients. Furthermore, as a result of these misleading claims, significant media attention and public critiques of the profession are being made. We believe inaction by regulatory bodies will lead to confusion among the public and other healthcare providers, unfortunately damaging the profession\u2019s reputation. The resulting effect on the reputation of the profession is greatly concerning to us, as students. CONCLUSION: It is our hope that all regulatory bodies will protect the public by taking appropriate action against chiropractors making unfounded claims contradicting public health policy. We believe it is the responsibility of all stakeholders in the chiropractic profession to ensure this is carried out and the standard of care is raised. We call on current chiropractors to ensure a viable profession exists moving forward.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plener, Joshua; Csiernik, Ben; Bejarano, Geronimo; Hjertstrand, Jesper; Goodall, Benjamin","journal":"Chiropr Man Therap","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4329836424d74ec0d665047373bfa72fbb622b14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7218504.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404205/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12998-020-00318-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SMT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chiropractic profession","current claims","unfounded claims","misleading claims","unsubstantiated claims","viable profession","public critiques","SMT","official public health policy","current chiropractors","chiropractic institutions","profession\u2019s reputation","relevant immunity enhancement","current global health crisis","World Federation of Chiropractic","relevant evidence","lack","regulatory bodies","significant media attention","rapid review","scientific evidence","damaging ramifications","significant potential risk","coronavirus pandemic","spinal manipulative therapy","appropriate action","researchers","patients","healthcare providers","confusion","MAIN TEXT","associations","hope","perspective","stakeholders","resulting effect","commentary","BACKGROUND","responsibility","inaction","subset","time of need","standard of care","CONCLUSION","students"],"language":"en"},

Deformed wing virus (DWV), an RNA virus described from honeybees (Apis mellifera), has been shown to have a broad host range. Since ants are often scavenging on dead honeybees, foodborne transmission of these viruses may occur. However, the role of the ant Myrmica rubra as an alternative host is not known and foodborne transmission to ants has not been experimentally addressed yet. Here, we show with a 16-week feeding experiment that foodborne transmission enables DWV type-A and -B to infect M. rubra and that these ants may serve as a virus reservoir. However, the titers of both plus- and minus-sense viral RNA strands decreased over time. Since the ants were fed with highly virus-saturated honeybee pupae, this probably resulted in initial viral peaks, then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected individuals later. Since DWV infections were also found in untreated field-collected M. rubra colonies, our results support the wide host range of DWV and further suggest foodborne transmission as a so far underestimated spread mechanism.","publish_time":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schl\u00E4ppi, Daniel; Lattrell, Patrick; Ya\u00F1ez, Orlando; Chejanovsky, Nor; Neumann, Peter","journal":"Insects","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba29366173f97f54a22e5c410b3d05e9a9649d28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6920936.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31703426/; https://doi.org/10.3390/insects10110394","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DWV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["foodborne transmission","ants","Virus host shifts","RNA virus","wide host range of DWV","alternative host","range of host species","broad host range","virus reservoir","DWV type","DWV infections","actual transmission pathways","Deformed wing virus","rubra colonies","virus-saturated honeybee pupae","ant Myrmica rubra","dead honeybees","minus-sense viral RNA strands","lower equilibrium titers","initial viral peaks","results","experiment","untreated field","infected individuals","time","Apis mellifera","role","underestimated spread mechanism","week","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Selected viruses were also inoculated into chicken embryos for studies of foreign gene expression at different tissue level. The results demonstrated the stability of recombinant viruses depends on the intrinsic properties of the foreign gene itself as well as the position at which the foreign genes were inserted.

To explore the potential use of IBV as a vaccine vector a reverse genetics system was utilised to generate infectious recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) expressing the reporter genes enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or humanised Renilla luciferase (hRluc). Infectious rIBVs were obtained following the replacement of Gene 5 or the intergenic region (IR) with eGFP or hRluc, or the replacement of ORFs 3a and 3b with hRluc. The replacement of Gene 5 with an IBV codon-optimised version of the hRluc gene also resulted in successful rescue of infectious rIBV. Reporter gene expression was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, or luciferase activity assays, for all successfully rescued rIBVs following infection of primary chick kidney (CK) cells. The genetic stability of rIBVs was analysed by serial passage on CK cells. Recombinant IBV stability varied depending on the genome region being replaced, with the reporter genes maintained up to at least passage 8 (P8) following replacement of Gene 5, P7 for replacement of the IR and P5 for replacement of ORFs 3a and 3b. Codon-optimisation of the hRluc gene, when replacing Gene 5, resulted in an increase in genome stability, with hRluc expression stable up to P10 compared to P8 for standard hRluc. Repeated passaging of rIBVs expressing hRluc at an MOI of 0.01 demonstrated an increase in stability, with hRluc expression stable up to at least P12 following the replacement of Gene 5. This study has demonstrated that heterologous genes can be incorporated into, and expressed from a range of IBV genome locations and that replacement of accessory Gene 5 offers a promising target for realising the potential of IBV as a vaccine vector for other avian pathogens.","publish_time":"2013-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bentley, Kirsten; Armesto, Maria; Britton, Paul","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f7d12535c961aa81e3719db27546b741674c1aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3694013.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23840781/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hRluc gene","replacement of Gene","replacement of accessory Gene","Infectious rIBVs","standard hRluc","Reporter gene expression","replacement of ORFs","hRluc expression stable","potential of IBV","Recombinant IBV stability","genome stability","genetic stability of rIBVs","rescued rIBVs","potential use of IBV","reporter genes","range of IBV genome locations","infectious recombinant IBVs","IBV codon-optimised version","genome region","Repeated passaging of rIBVs","avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","eGFP","successful rescue of infectious rIBV","vaccine vector","CK cells","increase","P8","heterologous genes","respiratory disease infectious bronchitis of domestic fowl","intergenic region","avian pathogens","Codon-optimisation","serial passage","luciferase activity assays","humanised Renilla luciferase","infection of primary chick kidney","fluorescence microscopy","green fluorescent protein","causative agent","P10","P12","promising target","reverse genetics system","P5","P7","MOI","study","routine vaccination"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, by using plaque inhibition, luciferase reporter plasmids, qRT-PCR, western blotting, and ELISA assays, we have investigated the effect and mechanism of OMT on influenza A virus (IAV) replication and IAV-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that OMT had excellent anti-IAV activity on eight IAV strains in vitro. OMT could significantly decrease the promoter activity of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, and TRAF6 genes, inhibit IAV-induced activations of Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-\u03BAB pathways, and suppress the expressions of inflammatory cytokines and MMP-2/-9. Activators of TLR4, p38 MAPK and NF-\u03BAB pathways could significantly antagonize the anti-IAV activity of OMT in vitro, including IAV replication and IAV-induced cytopathogenic effect (CPE). Furthermore, OMT could reduce the loss of body weight, significantly increase the survival rate of IAV-infected mice, decrease the lung index, pulmonary inflammation and lung viral titter, and improve pulmonary histopathological changes. In conclusion, OMT possesses anti-IAV and anti-inflammatory activities, the mechanism of action may be linked to its ability to inhibit IAV-induced activations of TLR4, p38 MAPK, and NF-\u03BAB pathways.","publish_time":"2018-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dai, Jian-Ping; Wang, Qian-Wen; Su, Yun; Gu, Li-Ming; Deng, Hui-Xiong; Chen, Xiao-Xuan; Li, Wei-Zhong; Li, Kang-Sheng","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23f1565e1f4f6a5e0c92d96dc454299a9e37400b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5979549.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19040965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29570670/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OMT","IAV","MMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IAV replication","IAV strains","anti-IAV activity of OMT","IAV-induced inflammation","IAV-induced activations of TLR4","excellent anti-IAV activity","IAV-induced activations of Akt","mechanism of OMT","survival rate of IAV","p38 MAPK","NF-\u03BAB pathways","pulmonary inflammation","Activators of TLR4","promoter activity of TLR3","lung index","cytopathogenic effect","mechanism of action","lung viral titter","pulmonary histopathological changes","qRT-PCR","plaque inhibition","luciferase reporter plasmids","TLR7","infected mice","anti-inflammatory activities","influenza","virus","western blotting","TRAF6 genes","MyD88","ERK1","ELISA assays","ability","expressions of inflammatory cytokines","loss of body weight","strong immunosuppressive agent","MMP","present study","CPE","results","conclusion","Oxymatrine","clinic","years"],"language":"en"},

The microbial sampling was conducted via the air sampler method, and the reduction in S. epidermidis growth was monitored by performing three consecutive tests. Initially, a blank test was conducted to determine the natural decay rate and calibrate the experimental setup. After injecting the bacterial strain from 1240 to 11180 CFU per unit volume (m(3)), the natural decay rate showed a maximum deviation of 3.1% with a sampling error of 1.1% p at a confidence level of 95%. In addition, the particle size distribution in the test chamber was found to range from 0.3 to 5.0 \u03BCm, and a subsequent decrease in large-sized particles was observed with the operation of the air purifier, which is the size similar to that of suspended airborne bacteria. This can be used to assess the performance of the air purifier by calibrating the natural reduction value to the reduced operation value. Thus, the single-chamber technique is a promising approach for analyzing the removal efficacy of airborne bacteria from indoor air.","publish_time":"2019-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jung Hoon; Kim, Jeong Yup; Cho, Bo-Bae; Anusha, J.

Since healthy humans can be colonized with Ureaplasmas, its role as a pathogen remains controversial. In order to begin to define the role of the host in disease, we developed a rodent model of urinary tract infection (UTI) using Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Animals were inoculated with sterile broth, 10(1), 10(3), 10(5), 10(7), or 10(9 )log CFU of a rat-adapted strain of Ureaplasma parvum. RESULTS: Infected animals exhibited two distinct profiles, asymptomatic UTI and UTI complicated with struvite urolithiasis. Inoculum dose of U. parvum affected the incidence of UTI, and 50% to 57% of animals inoculated with \u2265 10(7 )CFU of U. parvum remained infected (p \u003C 0.04). However, inoculum dose did not influence immune response to U. parvum. Asymptomatic UTI was characterized by a minimal immune response that was predominantly monocytic and lymphocytic, with limited lesions, and elevated urinary levels of IFN-\u03B3, IL-18 and MCP-1 (P \u2264 0.02). UTI complicated with struvite formation was characterized by an exaggerated immune response that was mostly neutrophilic (P \u2264 0.0001), with lesions that showed extensive uroepithelial hyperplasia (P \u2264 0.0001), and a predominance of IL-1\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, and GRO/KC in the urine (P \u2264 0.02). Animals with asymptomatic UTI also had a significantly high rate of kidney infection (P \u2264 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Complications associated with U. parvum infection are primarily dependent upon host-specific factors rather than Ureaplasma microbial load. The immune response in F344 rats is similar to that which occurs in humans with ureaplasmal associated disease. Therefore, this model of infection is a useful tool for elucidating U. parvum-host interactions that confer UTI and disease.","publish_time":"2009-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reyes, Leticia; Reinhard, Mary; Brown, Mary B","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee3d6fcf2ed5408aef9c152f2e7145d916a1baee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2656517.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19171043/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-9-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Inoculum"],"organizations":["GRO/KC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic UTI","parvum infection","incidence of UTI","parvum-host interactions","model of infection","exaggerated immune response","minimal immune response","Infected animals","urogenital tract disease","rodent model of urinary tract infection","rat-adapted strain of Ureaplasma parvum","Ureaplasmas","predominance of IL","F344 rats","CFU of","role","healthy humans","Inoculum dose of","high rate of kidney infection","host-specific factors","limited lesions","struvite formation","struvite urolithiasis","log CFU","Ureaplasma microbial load","elevated urinary levels of IFN","strong association","distinct profiles","monocytic","useful tool","Fischer","Epidemiologic studies","KC","extensive uroepithelial hyperplasia","BACKGROUND","pathogen","urine","RESULTS","MCP","Complications","sterile broth","CONCLUSION","ureaplasmal","order"],"language":"en"},

Thirteen articles documented the occurrence of recognized zoonotic organisms in dogs in Aboriginal communities, including Toxocara canis, Dirofilaria immitis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Rickettsia felis, Sarcoptes scabiei and Giardia. Currently, there is definitive evidence indicating that dogs act as a reservoir for human scabies in Aboriginal communities.

Multiple recommendations exist on how radiation oncology practices should deal with this crisis, but little information is available on what actually happens when the COVID-19 surge arrives. New York City experienced the first surge of COVID-19 in the United States and is now the epicenter of the global pandemic. This study reviews the impact of COVID-19 on a hospital system in New York on aspects of medicine, nursing, radiation therapy, and administration. Materials/Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of the department of radiation oncology in a single health system in New York from 3/1/20 to 4/1/20. Collaboration was obtained from physicians, nursing, radiation therapy, and administration to recall their policies and impact on specific duties. A timeline was reconstructed to chronicle significant events. Numbers were obtained for patients on treatment, treatments breaks, and COVID-19 infections amongst staff and patients. Results The COVID-19 surge had a tremendous impact on the health system including cessation of all of surgeries, including oncologic surgery, as well as transfer of all inpatient oncology services to makeshift outpatient facilities. Radiation Oncology made aggressive efforts to reduce patients on treatment to protect patients and staff as well reallocate staff and space for more acute clinical needs. Patients on-beam were reduced by 27% from 172 to 125 by 4/1/20. Almost all visits were changed to telemedicine within 2 weeks.

Recent studies have shown the importance of lung antioxidant defense systems against injury by IAV. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) activates the majority of antioxidant genes. METHODS: Alveolar type II (ATII) cells and alveolar macrophages (AM) were isolated from human lungs not suitable for transplantation and donated for medical research. In some studies ATII cells were transdifferentiated to alveolar type I-like (ATI-like) cells. Alveolar epithelial cells were infected with A/PR/8/34 (PR8) virus. We analyzed PR8 virus production, influenza A nucleoprotein levels, ROS generation and expression of antiviral genes. Immunocytofluorescence was used to determine Nrf2 translocation and western blotting to detect Nrf2, HO-1 and caspase 1 and 3 cleavage. We also analyzed ingestion of PR8 virus infected apoptotic ATII cells by AM, cytokine levels by ELISA, glutathione levels, necrosis and apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Moreover, we determined the critical importance of Nrf2 using adenovirus Nrf2 (AdNrf2) or Nrf2 siRNA to overexpress or knockdown Nrf2, respectively. RESULTS: We found that IAV induced oxidative stress, cytotoxicity and apoptosis in ATI-like and ATII cells. We also found that AM can ingest PR8 virus-induced apoptotic ATII cells (efferocytosis) but not viable cells, whereas ATII cells did not ingest these apoptotic cells. PR8 virus increased ROS production, Nrf2, HO-1, Mx1 and OAS1 expression and Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus. Nrf2 knockdown with siRNA sensitized ATI-like cells and ATII cells to injury induced by IAV and overexpression of Nrf2 with AdNrf2 protected these cells. Furthermore, Nrf2 overexpression followed by infection with PR8 virus decreased virus replication, influenza A nucleoprotein expression, antiviral response and oxidative stress. However, AdNrf2 did not increase IFN-\u03BB1 (IL-29) levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IAV induces alveolar epithelial injury and that Nrf2 protects these cells from the cytopathic effects of IAV likely by increasing the expression of antioxidant genes. Identifying the pathways involved in protecting cells from injury during influenza infection may be particularly important for developing new therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2012-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kosmider, Beata; Messier, Elise M; Janssen, William J; Nahreini, Piruz; Wang, Jieru; Hartshorn, Kevan L; Mason, Robert J","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/680c8cd646f4f78d97eddff21292668beba44d09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3520784.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-13-43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22672594/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATII","TUNEL","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apoptotic cells","viable cells","studies ATII cells","Alveolar epithelial cells","Nrf2 translocation","Nrf2 siRNA","overexpression of Nrf2","Nrf2 overexpression","knockdown Nrf2","Nrf2 knockdown","adenovirus Nrf2","respiratory epithelial cells","ingestion of PR8 virus infected apoptotic ATII cells","critical importance of Nrf2","PR8 virus production","virus replication","influenza infection","alveolar epithelial injury","PR8 virus increased ROS production","Alveolar type","expression of antioxidant genes","nucleoprotein expression","nucleoprotein levels","expression of antiviral genes","AdNrf2","alveolar macrophages","cytokine levels","glutathione levels","OAS1 expression","majority of antioxidant genes","cytopathic effects of IAV likely","mild upper respiratory infection","apoptosis","siRNA sensitized ATI","oxidative stress","RESULTS","importance of lung antioxidant defense systems","ROS generation","antiviral response","related factor","Recent studies","Nuclear factor-erythroid","clinical outcomes","necrosis","Mx1","transplantation","severe pneumonia","ELISA","cytotoxicity","western blotting","efferocytosis","TUNEL assay","IFN-\u03BB1","new therapeutic strategies","human lungs","caspase","METHODS","nucleus","BACKGROUND","medical research","CONCLUSIONS","Immunocytofluorescence","pathways","cleavage"],"language":"en"},

Based on recent data suggesting its role as entheropathogen, a case-control study was conducted between 2013 and 2016 to investigate the association of CanineCV with gastroenteritis in dogs, alone or in combination with other viral pathogens, including canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine distemper virus (CDV). A total of 219 dogs suffering from acute gastroenteritis disorders and 67 controls randomly recruited among healthy dogs or patients presenting without enteric signs were screened by a panel of real-time (RT-)PCR assays for CanineCV, CPV, CCoV and CDV. A high prevalence of viral infections was detected in dogs with gastroenteritis (77.16%), with CPV representing the most frequently detected enteropathogen, followed by CanineCV and CCoV. While CPV and CCoV infections displayed a strong association with occurrence of acute gastroenteritis (p\u003C 0.00001), detection of CanineCV in control dogs (28.35%) occurred with prevalence comparable to that of clinical cases (32.42%), so that its correlation with gastrointestinal disease was not statistically supported (p =0.530988).

Objectives To study the best approach for the diagnosis of human metapneumovirus infections by both conventional and molecular methods, along with the human metapneumovirus circulation rate in northern Italy and the severity of human metapneumovirus respiratory infections in a pediatric patient population. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were taken from 306 pediatric patients during the winter\u2013spring season 2003\u20132004, and examined for conventional respiratory viruses by direct fluorescent staining and cell culture, while human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus were sought by RT-PCR. Results RT-PCR detected human metapneumovirus in 40/306 (13.1%) children positive for respiratory viruses, with an incidence intermediate between that of respiratory syncytial virus (58 patients, 18.9%) and that of influenzavirus infections (29 patients, 9.5%).

Since then, PDCoV has been identified in a number of U.S. states and linked with clinical disease including acute diarrhea and vomiting in the absence of other identifiable pathogens. Since PDCoV was just recently linked with clinical disease, few specific antibody-based reagents were available to assist in diagnosis of PDCoV and limited serological capabilities were available to detect an antibody response to this virus. Therefore, the overall objective of this project was to develop and validate selected diagnostic reagents and assays for PDCoV antigen and antibody detection. RESULTS: The nucleoprotein of PDCoV was expressed as a recombinant protein and purified for use as an antigen to immunize mice for polyclonal, hyperimmune sera and monoclonal antibody (mAb) production. The resulting mAbs were evaluated for use in fluorescent antibody staining methods to detect PDCoV infected cells following virus isolation attempts and for immunohistochemistry staining of intestinal tissues of infected pigs. The same antigen was used to develop serological tests to detect the antibody response to PDCoV in pigs following infection. Serum samples from swine herds with recent documentation of PDCoV infection and samples from expected na\u00EFve herds were used for initial assay optimization. The tests were optimized in a checkerboard fashion to reduce signal to noise ratios using samples of known status. Statistical analysis was performed to establish assay cutoff values and assess diagnostic sensitivities and specificities. At least 629 known negative serum samples and 311 known positive samples were evaluated for each assay. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of 96.1 % and diagnostic specificity (DSp) of 96.2 %. The fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) showed a DSe of 95.8 % and DSp of 98.1 %. Both ELISA and FMIA detected seroconversion of challenged pigs between 8\u201314 days post-infection (DPI). An indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test was also developed using cell culture adapted PDCoV for comparative purposes. CONCLUSION: These new, specific reagents and serological assays will allow for improved diagnosis of PDCoV. Since many aspects of PDCoV infection and transmission are still not fully understood, the reagents and assays developed in this project should provide valuable tools to help understand this disease and to aid in the control and surveillance of porcine deltacoronavirus outbreaks.","publish_time":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Okda, Faten; Lawson, Steven; Liu, Xiaodong; Singrey, Aaron; Clement, Travis; Hain, Kyle; Nelson, Julie; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric A.","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a58dd3509470bd8a8a25fa473991ca6681066d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4898321.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0716-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27277214/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMIA"],"locations":["China","U.S."],"keyphrases":["PDCoV antigen","nucleoprotein of PDCoV","aspects of PDCoV infection","PDCoV infected cells","improved diagnosis of PDCoV","antibody response","recent documentation of PDCoV infection","monoclonal antibody","antibody detection","indirect fluorescent antibody","specific antibody-based reagents","samples of known status","fluorescent antibody staining methods","serological assays","positive samples","specific reagents","selected diagnostic reagents","negative serum samples","diagnostic sensitivities","diagnostic sensitivity","immunosorbent assay","serological tests","diagnostic specificity","clinical disease","use","assay cutoff values","ELISA","initial assay optimization","FMIA","novel porcine deltacoronavirus","days post-infection","project","DSe","DSp","surveillance of porcine deltacoronavirus outbreaks","immunohistochemistry staining of intestinal tissues of infected pigs","limited serological capabilities","seroconversion of challenged pigs","fluorescent microsphere immunoassay","porcine coronavirus HKU15","swine herds","na\u00EFve herds","virus isolation attempts","noise ratios","hyperimmune sera","signal","mice","cell culture","control","checkerboard fashion","absence","acute diarrhea","comparative purposes","IFA","specificities","production","valuable tools","states","BACKGROUND","enzyme","CONCLUSION","recombinant protein","transmission","resulting mAbs","Statistical analysis","identifiable pathogens","China","overall objective","RESULTS","number of"],"language":"en"},

Nylon 6 nanofiber filters were loaded with polydispersed NaCl particles, 60%\u003C100nm and 90%\u003C160nm, generated from an aerosol generator. Air jets in form of backpulse, backblow and their combined mode were used to clean a loaded filter. During cleaning, the filter cake was removed first for which the pressure drop across the loaded filter decreased rapidly, followed by loosely attached aerosols in the filter being removed with finite pressure drop reduction at a reasonable rate, ending in the final stage for which much lesser aerosols were being removed. Ultimately, the filter reached a residual pressure drop which was higher than that of the initial clean filter indicating residual aerosols were trapped both in the cake heel and filter. Backpulse has been found to be more effective in removing the cake from the filter surface, whereas backblow provides an added advantage of removing by convection of the detached aerosols away from the filter preventing recapture.

The genetic analysis indicated that they have distinct but relatively close evolutionary relationships to known influenza A viruses. However, the infectivity and adaptation of bat influenza viruses in avian species remain unclear. In this study, two modified bat influenza viruses cH9cN2/H17 and cH9cN2/H18 containing HA and NA coding regions replaced with those of H9N2 influenza A virus were generated in the background of the H17N10 or H18N11 viruses. These two modified viruses replicated less efficiently than wild type H9N2 virus in cultured chicken cells. The mini-genome assay showed that viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) of H9N2 has significantly higher polymerase activity than that of bat influenza viruses in avian cells. In chicken study, compared with H9N2 virus, which replicated and transmitted efficiently in chickens, the cH9cN2/H17 and cH9cN2/H18 viruses only replicated in chicken tracheas with lower titers. Pathological examination showed that the H9N2 caused severer lesions in lung and trachea than the modified bat influenza viruses. Notably, the cH9cN2/H18 transmitted among chickens, but not cH9cN2/H17, and chicken IFN-\u03B2 antagonism results showed that H18N11 NS1 protein inhibited chicken IFN-\u03B2 response more efficiently than H17N10 NS1 protein in avian cells. Taken together, our data indicated that the internal genes of bat influenza viruses adapted poorly to chickens, while the internal genes of H18N11 seemed to adapt to chickens better than H17N10.","publish_time":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Chaochao; Chen, Yinyin; Zhang, Min; Zhang, Ting; Bao, Danqi; Lu, Chenyang; Xue, Ruixue; Zhang, Yanjie; Liu, Wenhua; Chen, Hongjun; Teng, Qiaoyang; Yang, Jianmei; Li, Xuesong; Li, Zejun; Liu, Qinfang","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47f5c3ffb189c8fe45772cb5cb70dcc285f692b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117387.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030840/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518314937; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.04.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518314937","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H9N2 influenza","H18N11 viruses","modified bat influenza viruses cH9cN2","H18 viruses","modified viruses","adaptation of bat influenza viruses","internal genes of bat influenza viruses","Abstract Influenza virus","chickens","chicken study","chicken tracheas","cultured chicken cells","wild type H9N2 virus","avian cells","H17N10 NS1 protein","internal genes of H18N11","sequences of H17N10","H18N11 NS1 protein inhibited chicken IFN-\u03B2 response","live virus isolated","chicken IFN-\u03B2 antagonism results","avian species","HA","lung","viral ribonucleoproteins","NA coding regions","higher polymerase activity","vRNPs","close evolutionary relationships","severer lesions","mini-genome assay","infectivity","background","lower titers","Pathological examination","genetic analysis","data","bats"],"language":"en"},

Host factors associated with more severe HRV illness included maternal and family history of atopy (median score 3.5, IQR [1.0-7.8] vs. 2.0 [1.0-5.2], and 3.5 [1.0-7.5] vs.2.0 [0-4.0]). In adjusted analyses maternal history of atopy conferred an increase in risk for more severe HRV bronchiolitis (OR=2.39, 95% CI:1.14-4.99, p=0.02). In a similar model, maternal asthma was also associated with greater HRV bronchiolitis severity (OR=2.49, 95% CI: 1.10-5.67, p=0.03). Among HRV, 35% were HRVA, 6% HRVB, and 30% HRVC. CONCLUSION: HRV was a frequent cause of bronchiolitis and URI among previously healthy term infants requiring hospitalization or unscheduled outpatient visits. Substantial genetic diversity was seen amongst the HRV, and predominant groups varied by season and year. Host factors including maternal atopy were associated with more severe infant HRV illness.","publish_time":"2011-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, E.

High calf mortality rates can be related to larger numbers of calves in a herd, employee performance, severe weather, and the neonatal period covering the first 4 weeks of life. Although the basic premise of preventing newborn calf mortality is early detection and treatment of calves at risk for failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulins, calf mortality due to infectious diseases such as acute diarrhea increases in the presence of these physical and psychological stressors. This suggests that farmers should not ignore the effects of secondary environmental factors. For prevention rather than cure, the quality of the environment should be improved, which will improve not only animal welfare but also productivity.

In order to study whether HBoV1 can cause RTI, we investigated its presence in children with upper RTI (URTI), lower RTI (LRTI) and a control group of children without RTI. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and blood samples were collected from children admitted to hospital with RTI from 6 June 2007 to 28 February 2009 (n =1154), and from children admitted for elective surgery who had no RTI (n =162). Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the NPAs were examined for 17 infectious agents including HBoV1. Blood samples were tested with HBoV1-PCR only. Results HBoV1 was detected in NPAs from 10% of patients and 17% of controls. Adjusted for age, gender and the presence of other viruses, HBoV1 was not associated with RTI. In the HBoV1-positive NPAs, at least one other virus was detected in 75% and the virus appeared alone in 25%. Adjusted for age and gender, the detection of HBoV1 as the sole virus was associated with RTI, but not with LRTI. Viraemia was found only in children with RTI. The study showed that it was associated with RTI and LRTI. A high HBoV1-load was associated with LRTI, but not with RTI. No interactions between HBoV1 and other infectious agents were found. Conclusions Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 causes RTI in children, because detection of HBoV1 alone, viraemia and high viral load are associated with RTI and/or LRTI in this age group. However, HBoV1 is common in healthy children.","publish_time":"2010-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Christensen, Andreas; Nordb\u00F8, Svein Arne; Krokstad, Sidsel; Rognlien, Anne Gro Wesenberg; D\u00F8llner, Henrik","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40187ae285adc4890e73a767bf78d18f570bc95c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108378.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210003057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20833582/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210003057; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.07.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Viraemia"],"organizations":["LRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of HBoV1","HBoV1-PCR","upper RTI","lower RTI","Results HBoV1","high HBoV1-load","HBoV1-positive NPAs","LRTI","healthy children","control group of children","age group","presence","blood samples","gender","Viraemia","infectious agents","sole virus","high viral load","Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates","URTI","objectives Human bocavirus","hypothesis","Abstract Background","respiratory tract infections","polymerase chain reaction","elective surgery","data","interactions","viruses","Conclusions","patients","hospital","controls","order"],"language":"en"},

In humans, the respiratory epithelium is the only site where the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule is effectively cleaved, generating infectious virus particles. Virus transmission occurs through a susceptible individual\u2019s contact with aerosols or respiratory fomites from an infected individual. The inability of the lung to perform its primary function of gas exchange can result from multiple mechanisms, including obstruction of the airways, loss of alveolar structure, loss of lung epithelial integrity from direct epithelial cell killing, and degradation of the critical extracellular matrix. Approximately 30\u201340% of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza are diagnosed with acute pneumonia. These patients who develop pneumonia are more likely to be \u003C 5 years old, \u003E 65 years old, Caucasian, and nursing home residents; have chronic lung or heart disease and history of smoking, and are immunocompromised. Influenza can primarily cause severe pneumonia, but it can also present in conjunction with or be followed by a secondary bacterial infection, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Influenza is associated with a high predisposition to bacterial sepsis and ARDS. Viral infections presenting concurrently with bacterial pneumonia are now known to occur with a frequency of 30\u201350% in both adult and pediatric populations. The H3N2 subtype has been associated with unprecedented high levels of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Influenza A is the predominant viral etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults. Risk factors independently associated with ARDS are age between 36 and 55 years old, pregnancy, and obesity, while protective factors are female sex, influenza vaccination, and infections with Influenza A (H3N2) or Influenza B viruses. In the ICU, particularly during the winter season, influenza should be suspected not only in patients with typical symptoms and epidemiology, but also in patients with severe pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis with or without bacterial co-infection, as well as in patients with encephalitis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis.","publish_time":"2019-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalil, Andre C.; Thomas, Paul G.","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67a72161f9ca2ec9aa5649980667e7fef2125539.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6642581.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31324202/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-019-2539-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza virus","influenza vaccination","bacterial pneumonia","ARDS","Influenza B viruses","acute pneumonia","severe pneumonia","years old","bacterial sepsis","hospitalized patients","direct viral infection","bacterial co-infection","secondary bacterial infection","respiratory fomites","respiratory tract","respiratory epithelium","Viral infections","loss of lung epithelial integrity","chronic lung","ICU","Virus transmission","predominant viral etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome","direct epithelial cell","infectious virus particles","high predisposition","protective factors","Risk factors","H3N2 subtype","loss of alveolar structure","unprecedented high levels of intensive care unit","susceptible individual\u2019s contact","nursing home residents","aerosols","degradation","damage","obesity","female sex","heart disease","history of smoking","airways","Caucasian","multiple mechanisms","primary function of gas exchange","Staphylococcus aureus","obstruction","admission","site","pregnancy","epidemiology","infected individual","immune system response","molecule","hemagglutinin","critical extracellular matrix","Streptococcus pneumoniae","adults","encephalitis","myocarditis","typical symptoms","winter season","laboratory","pediatric populations","rhabdomyolysis","humans","inability","conjunction","frequency"],"language":"en"},

By this time (February 28, 2020) 58 countries or territories and one international conveyance (Diamond Princess Cruise Ship) were affected. As a part of the global response to manage and contain the pandemic, major emphasis was placed on generating research intelligence to guide evidence-based responses to contain the virus, which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), owing to its genetic similarities with the SARS virus. This review summarizes the emerging evidence which can help guide the public health response, particularly in India. Key areas have been identified in which research needs to be conducted to generate critical intelligence for advising prevention and control efforts. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has once again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness, ability to respond to an infectious threat, the rapidity of transmission of infections across international borders and the ineffectiveness of knee-jerk policy responses to emerging/re-emerging infectious disease threats. The review concludes with the key learning points from the ongoing efforts to prevent and contain COVID-19 and identifies the need to invest in health systems, community-led response mechanisms and the need for preparedness and global health security.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chatterjee, Pranab; Nagi, Nazia; Agarwal, Anup; Das, Bhabatosh; Banerjee, Sayantan; Sarkar, Swarup; Gupta, Nivedita; Gangakhedkar, Raman R","journal":"The Indian journal of medical research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_519_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242874/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Diamond Princess Cruise Ship"],"locations":["Republic","India"],"keyphrases":["public health response","global health security","global response","weaknesses of global health systems preparedness","SARS virus","SARS-CoV","public health emergency of international concern","international conveyance","international borders","need","response mechanisms","research intelligence","emergence of SARS","COVID","review","emerging evidence","confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease","evidence-based responses","infectious disease threats","ongoing efforts","infectious threat","critical intelligence","control efforts","Key areas","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","key learning points","ineffectiveness of knee-jerk policy responses","ability","rapidity of transmission","spillover event","Diamond Princess Cruise Ship","Wuhan","epicenter","infections","overall case fatality rate","People\u0027s Republic of China","countries","territories","prevention","nCoV","community","major emphasis","pandemic","genetic similarities","India","confidence interval","deaths","time","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

The use of vaccines is the main approach to control of the economically important poultry viral respiratory diseases infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) infections and infectious bronchitis (IB). This paper appraises the current methods of vaccine control in the light of the nature of each virus and epidemiological factors associated with each disease. 2. Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) exists as a single type with a wide range of disease severity. It is a serious disease in certain regions of the world. Recent work has distinguished molecular differences between vaccine and field strains and vaccine virus can be a cause of disease. Vaccines have remained unaltered for many years but new ones are being developed to counter vaccine side effects and reversion and reactivation of latent virus. 3. Avian metapneumoviruses, the cause of turkey rhinotracheitis and respiratory disease in chickens exists as 4 subtypes, A, B, C and D. A and B are widespread and vaccines work well provided that accurate doses are given. Newer vaccine developments are designed to eliminate reversion and possibly counter the appearance of newer field strains which may break through established vaccine coverage. 4. IB presents the biggest problem of the three. Being an unstable RNA virus, part of the viral genome that codes for the S1 spike gene can undergo mutation and recombination so that important antigenic variants can appear irregularly which may evade existing vaccine protection. While conventional vaccines work well against homologous types, new strategies are needed to counter this instability. Molecular approaches involving tailoring viruses to suit field challenges are in progress. However, the simple use of two genetically different vaccines to protect against a wide range of heterologous types is now a widespread practice that is very effective. 5. None of the three diseases described can claim to be satisfactorily controlled and it remains to be seen whether the newer generations of vaccines will be more efficacious and cost effective. The importance of constant surveillance is emphasised and the testing of novel vaccines cannot be achieved without the use of vaccine-challenge experiments in poultry.","publish_time":"2010-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Richard C.","journal":"Br Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c24923ebefe15cfec2dee6a0f80698c8dfe56fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154308.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20390564/; https://doi.org/10.1080/00071660903541378","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine virus","counter vaccine","use of vaccines","Newer vaccine developments","different vaccines","conventional vaccines","newer generations of vaccines","cause of disease","Infectious laryngotracheitis virus","established vaccine coverage","existing vaccine protection","current methods of vaccine control","serious disease","testing of novel vaccines","wide range of disease severity","reactivation of latent virus","unstable RNA virus","appearance of newer field strains","important poultry viral respiratory diseases infectious laryngotracheitis","infectious bronchitis","field challenges","reversion","simple use","IB","Recent work","wide range of heterologous types","viral genome","homologous types","molecular differences","Avian metapneumoviruses","Molecular approaches","new ones","new strategies","widespread practice","cause of turkey rhinotracheitis","important antigenic variants","recombination","mutation","aMPV","infections","S1 spike gene","codes","tailoring viruses","nature","chickens","ILTV","effects","light","single type","main approach","certain regions","subtypes","years","epidemiological factors","challenge experiments","world","paper","importance of constant surveillance","biggest problem","progress","accurate doses","instability"],"language":"en"},

Field studies have monitored coronaviruses in surface waters, sewage, slurry, and biosolids. Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 \u00B0C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution. HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods. The scarcity of information on HCoV in the environment suggests that research is needed to understand the fate of these viruses in the water cycle.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Annalaura, Carducci; Ileana, Federigi; Dasheng, Liu; Julian R, Thompson; Marco, Verani","journal":"Water Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199000.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389891/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115907","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["water cycle","different types of water","HCoVs","removal efficiency of water treatments","recovery efficiency of analytical methods","detection methods","low recovery efficiency","Field studies","human coronaviruses","field investigations","non-enveloped viruses","survival","heterogeneous purposes","knowledge gaps","surface waters","fecal elimination","art","sewage","close contacts","slurry","temperature","inclusion criteria","main route of transmission","surrogates","possible spread","current state","new pandemic SARS-CoV","persistence","environment","microbial pollution","research","droplets","lab scale","fate","scarcity of information","scientific literature search","days","biosolids","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Sixty cats, diagnosed with dry FIP by primary care and specialist veterinarians and meeting the acceptance criteria, were treated with PI without intentional selection of less severe cases. The survival time from the start of PI treatment in cats diagnosed with dry FIP showed that of the 60 cats with dry FIP treated with PI, 8 survived over 200 days, and 4 of 60 survived over 300 days. A literature search identified 59 cats with non-effusive or dry FIP; no cat with only dry FIP lived longer than 200 days. Veterinarians of cats treated with PI that survived over 30 days reported improvements in clinical signs and behavior.

The aim of this study was twofold: first, investigate the pathogen profiles and the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viruses among Japanese CAP patients; and second, explore the clinical significance of viral infections. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at Kyorin University Hospital. To identify respiratory pathogens, hospitalized CAP patients were enrolled, and reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction technology was applied alongside conventional microbiological methods. Phylogenetic and pairwise distance analyses of 10 viruses were performed. CAP patients were divided into four etiological groups (virus alone, bacteria alone, co-detection of virus and bacteria, and not detected) and the clinical findings were compared. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were enrolled. Bacteria alone were detected in 39.5% (n=30) of CAP patients. Virus alone or co-detection were found in 10.5% (n=8) and 11.8% (n=9) of cases, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae and human metapneumovirus were the most frequently detected bacterium and virus, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and human respiratory syncytial virus showed that different subgroups and genotypes might be associated with CAP. Respiratory failure was more common when a virus was detected (both virus alone and co-detection groups; n=17, 100%, p\u003C0.05) than when a bacteria alone was detected (n=17, 56.7%).

RNA has intrinsically defined features on the nanometer scale and is a particularly interesting candidate for such applications due to its amazing diversity, flexibility and versatility in structure and function. Specifically, the current use of siRNA to silence target genes involved in disease has generated much excitement in the scientific community. The intrinsic ability to sequence-specifically down-regulate gene expression in a temporally- and spatially-controlled fashion has led to heightened interest and rapid development of siRNA-based therapeutics. Though methods for gene silencing with high efficacy and specificity have been achieved in vitro, the effective delivery of nucleic acids to specific cells in vivo has been a hurdle for RNA therapeutics. This review covers different RNA-based approaches for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human disease, with a focus on the latest developments of nonviral carriers of siRNA for delivery in vivo.

The construction of these clones is commonly based on high- or low-copy number plasmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors, and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Prokaryotic promoters have consistently been used for the transcription of these clones. The goal of this study was to develop a novel DENV infectious clone in a BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and to generate a virus with the fusion envelope-green fluorescent protein in an attempt to track virus infection. The transfection of Vero cells with a plasmid encoding the DENV infectious clone facilitated the recovery of infectious particles that increased in titer after serial passages in C6/36 cells. The plaque size and syncytia phenotypes of the recombinant virus were similar to those of the parental virus. Despite the observation of autonomous replication and the detection of low levels of viral genome after two passages, the insertion of green fluorescent protein and Renilla luciferase reporter genes negatively impacted virus rescue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using a DENV infectious clone under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter to facilitate the recovery of recombinant viruses without the need for in vitro transcription. This novel molecular clone will be useful for establishing the molecular basis of replication, assembly, and pathogenesis, evaluating potential antiviral drugs, and the development of vaccine candidates for attenuated recombinant viruses.","publish_time":"2014-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Usme-Ciro, Jose A.; Lopera, Jaime A.; Enjuanes, Luis; Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando; Gallego-Gomez, Juan C.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4991ef774eb4e7811f8aae5ac768cb335206183.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114509.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24342140/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213004309; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213004309","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel DENV infectious clone","Dengue virus","virus infection","parental virus","use of infectious clones","impacted virus rescue","recovery of infectious particles","novel molecular clone","recovery of recombinant viruses","control","attenuated recombinant viruses","cytomegalovirus promoter","study","transcription","insertion of green fluorescent protein","bacterial artificial chromosomes","molecular basis of replication","fusion envelope-green fluorescent protein","serial passages","cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter","observation of autonomous replication","transfection of Vero cells","yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors","detection of low levels of viral genome","Renilla luciferase reporter genes","development of vaccine candidates","syncytia phenotypes","pathogenesis","assembly","titer","number plasmids","attempt","potential antiviral drugs","Abstract Major progress","C6","biology","need","plaque size","reverse genetics","BACs","knowledge","Prokaryotic promoters","best","goal","construction"],"language":"en"},

The management of these patients is still evolving. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-center observational cohort study of critically ill patients infected with COVID-19. Bedside clinicians abstracted daily patient data on history, treatment, and short-term course. We describe management and a proposed severity scale for treatment used in this hospital. RESULTS: 44 patients were enrolled; with incomplete information on 11. Of the 33 studied patients, 91% were male, median age 64; 88% were overweight or obese. 45% were hypertensive, 12% had been taking an ACE-inhibitor. Noninvasive ventilation was performed on 39% of patients for part or all or their ICU stay with no provider infection. Most patients received antibiotics for pneumonia. Patients also received lopinivir/ritonavir (82%), hydroxychloroquine (79%), and tocilizumab (12%) according to this treatment algorithm. Nine of 10 patients survived their ICU course and were transferred to the floor, with one dying in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: ICU patients with COVID-19 frequently have hypertension. Many could be managed with noninvasive ventilation, despite the risk of aerosolization. The use of a severity scale augmented clinician management.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piva, Simone; Filippini, Matteo; Turla, Fabio; Cattaneo, Sergio; Margola, Alessio; De Fulviis, Silvia; Nardiello, Ida; Beretta, Alessandra; Ferrari, Laura; Trotta, Raffaella; Erbici, Gloria; Foc\u00E0, Emanuele; Castelli, Francesco; Rasulo, Frank; Lanspa, Michael J.; Latronico, Nicola","journal":"J Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80c397cd11a3bcc3ef83acac8da92a4deb8ba208.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194649.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883944120305475; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.04.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944120305475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330817/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ICU patients","ill patients","studied patients","ICU course","treatment algorithm","Noninvasive ventilation","severity scale augmented clinician management","proposed severity scale","ongoing pandemic of COVID","short-term course","history","daily patient data","single-center observational cohort study","massive strain","healthcare infrastructure","Bedside clinicians","Lombardy","use","male","China","Italy","PURPOSE","Hubei","ritonavir","incomplete information","CONCLUSIONS","median age","risk of aerosolization","METHODS","provider infection","antibiotics","pneumonia","lopinivir","RESULTS","hospital","ACE-inhibitor","MATERIALS","hydroxychloroquine","floor","hypertension","tocilizumab"],"language":"en"},

Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns.

Notwithstanding a number of successful case studies, previous works have shown that using different mobility data sources, such as mobile phone data or census surveys, to parametrize infectious disease models can generate divergent outcomes. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent epidemic modelling results may vary when using different proxies for human movements. Here, we systematically compare 658 000 simulated outbreaks generated with a spatially structured epidemic model based on two different human mobility networks: a commuting network of France extracted from mobile phone data and another extracted from a census survey. We compare epidemic patterns originating from all the 329 possible outbreak seed locations and identify the structural network properties of the seeding nodes that best predict spatial and temporal epidemic patterns to be alike. We find that similarity of simulated epidemics is significantly correlated to connectivity, traffic and population size of the seeding nodes, suggesting that the adequacy of mobile phone data for infectious disease models becomes higher when epidemics spread between highly connected and heavily populated locations, such as large urban areas.","publish_time":"2017-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Panigutti, Cecilia; Tizzoni, Michele; Bajardi, Paolo; Smoreda, Zbigniew; Colizza, Vittoria","journal":"R Soc Open Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e398a3cd7f7d75bc06f0f15103309511299bb653.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5451791.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28572990/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["adequacy of mobile phone data","record data","different mobility data sources","temporal epidemic patterns","different human mobility networks","infectious disease models","different proxies","seeding nodes","human movements","structured epidemic model","ability of quantifying human travel patterns","extent epidemic modelling results","similarity of simulated epidemics","populated locations","census surveys","simulated outbreaks","commuting network of France","structural network properties","possible outbreak seed locations","previous works","broad applications","connectivity","population size","number of successful case studies","traffic","epidemiology","divergent outcomes","large urban areas","recent availability of large-scale"],"language":"en"},

As an in-hospital preparation, JZ-1 has been used in Tongji Hospital for many years to treat various infectious diseases of the lower female genital tract, including cervicitis, vaginitis, genital herpes and condyloma acuminatum. Our previous studies have shown that JZ-1 has curative effects on Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections. Aim of the study Genital herpes is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide and is mainly caused by herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2). Current therapies can relieve symptoms in patients but do not cure or prevent the spread of the virus. This study was designed to investigate the effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 infection and its mechanism, which is based on autophagy induction, to provide new ideas and a basis for the study of antiviral drugs. Materials and methods Evaluation of the antiviral activity of JZ-1 was conducted by MTT assay and western blotting. Then, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, observations through transmission electron microscopy and experiments with the recombinant lentivirus vector mRFP-GFP-LC3B were used to monitor autophagic flux in VK2/E6E7 cells. To explore the mechanism by which JZ-1 regulates autophagy, western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and to detect changes in critical molecules in the pathway after the application of a PI3K inhibitor. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, namely, IL-6, IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2 and TNF-\u03B1, were measured with qRT-PCR. Results HSV-2 infection inhibited autophagy in the VK2/E6E7 cells. Further study revealed that the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway induced by HSV-2 infection may result in the blocked autophagic flux and inhibited autophagosome and autolysosome formation. JZ-1 exhibited significant antiviral activity in the VK2/E6E7 cells, which showed increased cell vitality and reduced viral protein expression, namely, earliest virus-specific infected cell polypeptides 5 (ICP5) and glycoprotein D (gD). We found that JZ-1 treatment inhibited the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and promoted autophagy to combat HSV-2 infection, while PI3K inhibitor pretreatment prevented the enhanced autophagy induced by JZ-1. Moreover, JZ-1 attenuated the increase in inflammatory cytokines that had been induced HSV-2 infection.

Transmission of vector borne pathogens are particularly sensitive to these changes due to the complexity of their cycle, where the transmission of a microparasite depends on the interaction between its vector, usually a macroparasite, and its reservoir host, in many cases represented by a wildlife vertebrate. The scope of this paper focuses on the effect of some major, fast-occurring anthropogenic changes on the vectorial capacity for tick and mosquito borne pathogens. Specifically, we review and present the latest advances regarding two emerging vector-borne viruses in Europe: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and West Nile virus (WNV). In both cases, variation in vector to host ratio is critical in determining the intensity of pathogen transmission and consequently infection hazard for humans. Forecasting vector-borne disease hazard under the global change scenarios is particularly challenging, requiring long term studies based on a multidisciplinary approach in a One-Health framework.","publish_time":"2019-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rizzoli, Annapaola; Tagliapietra, Valentina; Cagnacci, Francesca; Marini, Giovanni; Arnoldi, Daniele; Rosso, Fausta; Ros\u00E0, Roberto","journal":"Int J Parasitol Parasites Wildl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52d9b4cc7d694101b07e611e194f0115f359249a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5237c45681cad45eb4e6c51317e32c0e9b638c08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6630057.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213224419300288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341772/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213224419300288; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2019.05.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["Transmission of vector","emerging vector","anthropogenic changes","parasites-host interaction","reservoir host","pathogens","cases","intensity of pathogen transmission","infection hazard","disease hazard","wildlife vertebrate","Tick-borne encephalitis virus","West Nile virus","important anthropogenic factors","wildlife zoonotic diseases emergence","TBEV","Europe","climate","viruses","vectorial capacity","global change scenarios","multidisciplinary approach","long term studies","land use","biodiversity","mosquito","ratio","Anthropocene context","effect","WNV","latest advances","humans","variation","macroparasite","Health framework","paper","cycle","complexity","microparasite","scope"],"language":"en"},

Previous experimental FIPV infection studies suggested a role for cell-mediated immunity in resistance to development of FIP. This experimental FIPV infection study in specific pathogen free (SPF) kittens describes longitudinal antiviral T cell responses and clinical outcomes ranging from rapid progression, slow progression, and resistance to disease. RESULTS: Differences in disease outcome provided an opportunity to investigate the role of T cell immunity to FIP determined by T cell subset proliferation after stimulation with different viral antigens. Reduced total white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte and T cell counts in blood were observed during primary acute infection for all experimental groups including cats that survived without clinical FIP. Antiviral T cell responses during early primary infection were also similar between cats that developed FIP and cats remaining healthy. Recovery of antiviral T cell responses during the later phase of acute infection was observed in a subset of cats that survived longer or resisted disease compared to cats showing rapid disease progression. More robust T cell responses at terminal time points were observed in lymph nodes compared to blood in cats that developed FIP. Cats that survived primary infection were challenged a second time to pathogenic FIPV and tested for antiviral T cell responses over a four week period. Nine of ten rechallenged cats did not develop FIP or T cell depletion and all cats demonstrated antiviral T cell responses at multiple time points after rechallenge. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, definitive adaptive T cell responses predictive of disease outcome were not detected during the early phase of primary FIPV infection. However emergence of antiviral T cell responses after a second exposure to FIPV, implicated cellular immunity in the control of FIPV infection and disease progression. Virus host interactions during very early stages of FIPV infection warrant further investigation to elucidate host resistance to FIP.","publish_time":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mustaffa-Kamal, Farina; Liu, Hongwei; Pedersen, Niels C.; Sparger, Ellen E.","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa0ea39aff2c19a92de12d6f0323721a9bfa38a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6532132.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118053/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1909-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cell depletion","robust T cell responses","longitudinal antiviral T cell responses","Recovery of antiviral T cell responses","emergence of antiviral T cell responses","role of T cell immunity","experimental infection","T cell subset proliferation","control of FIPV infection","subset of cats","cell-mediated immunity","early primary infection","face of infection","experimental FIPV infection study","clinical FIP","FIP virus","development of FIP","rechallenged cats","definitive adaptive T cell responses predictive of disease outcome","early stages of FIPV infection","primary acute infection","early phase of primary FIPV infection","Previous experimental FIPV infection studies","total white blood cell","pathogenic FIPV","rapid disease progression","later phase of acute infection","resisted disease","rapid progression","experimental groups","slow progression","host resistance","terminal time points","multiple time points","implicated cellular immunity","Virus host interactions","clinical outcomes","kittens","SPF","specific pathogen free","stimulation","WBC","exposure","summary","investigation","lymphocyte","lymph nodes","different viral antigens","opportunity","BACKGROUND","Feline infectious peritonitis","Differences","nature","week period","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","form"],"language":"en"},

They were exposed to a panel of 18 different viruses, including HIV and influenza viruses. Several lectins showed highly potent antiviral activity, often within the low nanomolar range. DSclerL and DLasiL exhibited EC(50) values (effective concentration of lectin required to inhibit virus-induced cytopathicity by 50%) of 9 nM to 46 nM for HIV-1 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively, DLasiL also inhibited feline corona virus at an EC(50) of 5 nM, and DSclerL, ConBr and ConM showed remarkably low EC(50) values ranging from 0.4 to 6 nM against influenza A virus strain H3N2 and influenza B virus. For HIV, evidence pointed to the blockage of entry of the virus into its target cells as the underlying mechanism of antiviral action of these lectins. Overall, the most promising lectins based on their EC(50) values were DLasiL, DSclerL, ConBr, ConM, SfL and HML.

Bats are also major hosts for biological agents responsible for zoonoses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs). The islands of the Western Indian Ocean are identified as a major biodiversity hotspot, with more than 50 bat species. In this study, we tested 1,013 bats belonging to 36 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles, based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. In total, 88 bats (8.7%) tested positive for coronaviruses, with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (20.5% \u00B1 4.9%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.5% \u00B1 1.5%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of \u03B1- and \u03B2-CoVs and a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species, with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites. This is the first study to report the presence of coronaviruses (CoVs) in bats in Mayotte, Mozambique and Reunion Island, and in insectivorous bats in Madagascar. Eight percent of the tested bats were positive for CoVs, with higher prevalence in continental Africa than on islands. A high genetic diversity of \u03B1- and \u03B2-CoVs was found, with strong association between bat host and virus phylogenies, supporting a long history of co-evolution between bats and their associated CoVs in the Western Indian Ocean.

In this study, the antiviral activities of H. perforatum on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo for the first time. The results of in vitro experiments confirmed that the antiviral component of H. perforatum was ethyl acetate extraction section (HPE), and results showed that treatment with HPE significantly reduced the relative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression and virus titer of IBV, and reduced positive green immunofluorescence signal of IBV in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells. HPE treatment at doses of 480\u2013120 mg/kg for 5 days, reduced IBV induced injury in the trachea and kidney, moreover, reduced the mRNA expression level of IBV in the trachea and kidney in vivo. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03B1), and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u03BAB) significantly decreased, but melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), mitochondrial antiviral signaling gene, interferon alpha (IFN-\u03B1), and interferon beta (IFN-\u03B2) mRNA levels significantly increased in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrated that HPE had significant anti-IBV effects in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In addition, it is possible owing to up-regulate mRNA expression of type I interferon through the MDA5 signaling pathway and down-regulate mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1 via the NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway. Moreover, the mainly active compositions of HPE analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization\u2013mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) are hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin, pseudohypericin, and hypericin, and a combination of these compounds could mediate the antiviral activities.

Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of \u201Cimmune enhancement\u201D). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MHC Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published gastrointestinal symptoms and detection of virus in stool, and also summarized data from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Methods We collected data from the cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong (n=59; diagnosis from February 2 through Feb 29, 2020), and searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and three Chinese databases through March 11, 2020 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We analyzed pooled data on the prevalence of overall and individual gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort) using a random effects model. Results Among the 59 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 15 patients (25.4%) had gastrointestinal symptoms and 9 patients (15.3%) had stool that tested positive for virus RNA. Stool viral RNA was detected in 38.5% and 8.7% among those with and without diarrhea, respectively (P=.02). The median fecal viral load was 5.1 log10cpm in patients with diarrhea vs 3.9 log10cpm in patients without diarrhea (P=.06). In a meta-analysis of 60 studies, comprising 4243 patients, the pooled prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 17.6% (95% CI, 12.3%\u201324.5%); 11.8% of patients with non-severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 4.1%\u201329.1%) and 17.1% of patients with severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 6.9%\u201336.7%). In the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of stool samples that were positive for virus RNA was 48.1% (95% CI, 38.3%\u201357.9%); of these samples, 70.3% of those collected after loss of virus from respiratory specimens tested positive for the virus (95% CI, 49.6%\u201385.1%). Conclusions In an analysis of data from the Hong Kong cohort of patients with COVID-19 and a meta-analysis of findings from publications, we found that 17.6% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms.

All type-specific qPCR assays reproducibly detected as few as 5 copies/reaction of quantified hexon recombinant plasmids with a linear dynamic range of 8 log units (5\u20135 \u00D7 10(7) copies). No non-specific amplifications were observed with concentrated nucleic acid from other HAdV types or other common respiratory pathogens. Of 199 previously typed HAdV field isolates and positive clinical specimens, all were detected and correctly identified to type by the qPCR assays; 10 samples had 2 HAdV types and 1 sample had 3 types identified which were confirmed by amplicon sequencing. The species C HAdV qPCR assays permit rapid, sensitive, specific and quantitative detection and identification of four recognized endemic HAdVs. Together with our previously developed qPCR assays for the epidemic respiratory HAdVs, these assays provide a convenient alternative to classical typing methods.","publish_time":"2016-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Xiaoyan; Erdman, Dean D.","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/984c03f0fe203604a4903fa8a620faf9b2969546.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173114.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416301689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27363737/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.05.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416301689","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Species C HAdV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HAdV types","species C HAdV qPCR assays","developed qPCR assays","type-specific qPCR assays","Species C HAdV infections","species C HAdVs","HAdV hexon gene","epidemic respiratory HAdVs","recognized species","recognized endemic HAdVs","quantitative detection","typed HAdV field isolates","important respiratory pathogens","common respiratory pathogens","quantitative type-specific real-time PCR","identification","upper respiratory tracts","copies","reaction of quantified hexon recombinant plasmids","linear dynamic range","immunocompromised persons","newborn","positive clinical specimens","concentrated nucleic acid","convenient alternative","severe disseminated disease","persistent shedding","classical typing methods","log units","samples","non-specific amplifications","serotypes","Human adenoviruses","therapeutic intervention","people","amplicon sequencing","life"],"language":"en"},

In this study we have characterized the apoptotic pathways activated by PRRSV infection. PRRSV-infected cells showed evidence of apoptosis including phosphatidylserine exposure, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, caspase activation (including caspase-8, 9, 3), and PARP cleavage. DNA fragmentation was dependent on caspase activation but blocking apoptosis by a caspase inhibitor did not affect PRRSV replication. Upregulation of Bax expression by PRRSV infection was followed by disruption of the mitochondria transmembrane potential, resulting in cytochrome c redistridution to the cytoplasm and subsequent caspase-9 activation. A crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways was demonstrated by dependency of caspase-9 activation on active caspase-8 and by Bid cleavage. Furthermore, in this study we provide evidence of the possible involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress in apoptosis induced by PRRSV. Our data indicated that cell death caused by PRRSV infection involves necrosis as well as apoptosis. In summary, these findings demonstrate mechanisms by which PRRSV induces apoptosis and will contribute to an enhanced understanding of PRRSV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2007-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sang-Myeong; Kleiboeker, Steven B.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/641fba8930688a3a0c95e376cdc04e5289410c8c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127477.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207002346; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207002346","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV infection","caspase activation","PRRSV replication","subsequent caspase","dependency of caspase","active caspase","caspase inhibitor","evidence of apoptosis","PRRSV-infected cells","enhanced understanding of PRRSV pathogenesis","DNA fragmentation","study","intrinsic pathways","apoptotic pathways","Bid cleavage","PARP cleavage","chromatin condensation","phosphatidylserine exposure","cytochrome c redistridution","cytoplasm","possible involvement of reactive oxygen species","respiratory syndrome virus","mitochondria transmembrane potential","viruses","disruption","cell death","oxidative stress","number","Upregulation of Bax expression","mechanisms","necrosis","crosstalk","findings","summary","data"],"language":"en"},

Antiviral drugs and vaccination may not be adequate to prevent catastrophe in such an event. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence of effectiveness of interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses (excluding vaccines and antiviral drugs, which have been previously reviewed). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, issue 4); MEDLINE (1966 to November 2006); OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965); EMBASE (1990 to November 2006); and CINAHL (1982 to November 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: We scanned 2300 titles, excluded 2162 and retrieved the full papers of 138 trials, including 49 papers of 51 studies. The quality of three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was poor; as were most cluster RCTs. The observational studies were of mixed quality. We were only able to meta\u2010analyse case\u2010control data. We searched for any interventions to prevent viral transmission of respiratory viruses (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection and hygiene). Study design included RCTs, cohort studies, case\u2010control studies, cross\u2010over studies, before\u2010after, and time series studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We scanned the titles, abstracts and full text articles using a standardised form to assess eligibility. RCTs were assessed according to randomisation method, allocation generation, concealment, blinding, and follow up. Non\u2010RCTs were assessed for the presence of potential confounders and classified as low, medium, and high risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: The highest quality cluster RCTs suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures around younger children. Additional benefit from reduced transmission from children to other household members is broadly supported in results of other study designs, where the potential for confounding is greater. The six case\u2010control studies suggested that implementing barriers to transmission, isolation, and hygienic measures are effective at containing respiratory virus epidemics. We found limited evidence that the more uncomfortable and expensive N95 masks were superior to simple surgical masks. The incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease respiratory disease remains uncertain. The lack of proper evaluation of global measures such as screening at entry ports and social distancing prevent firm conclusions about these measures. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS: Many simple and probably low\u2010cost interventions would be useful for reducing the transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses. Routine long\u2010term implementation of some of the measures assessed might be difficult without the threat of a looming epidemic. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses Although respiratory viruses usually only cause minor disease, they can cause epidemics. Approximately 10% to 15% of people worldwide contract influenza annually, with attack rates as high as 50% during major epidemics. Global pandemic viral infections have been devastating because of their wide spread. In 2003 the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic affected \u02DC8,000 people, killed 780, and caused an enormous social and economic crisis. A new avian influenza pandemic caused by the H5N1 strain might be more catastrophic. Single measures (particularly the use of vaccines or antiviral drugs) may be insufficient to interrupt the spread. We found 51 studies including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies with a mixed risk of bias. Respiratory virus spread might be prevented by hygienic measures around younger children. These might also reduce transmission from children to other household members. Implementing barriers to transmission, isolation, and hygienic measures may be effective at containing respiratory virus epidemics. There was limited evidence that (more uncomfortable and expensive) N95 masks were superior to simple ones. Adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing is of uncertain benefit. There is insufficient evaluation of global measures such as screening at entry ports and social distancing.","publish_time":"2008-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jefferson, Tom; Foxlee, Ruth; Del Mar, Chris; Dooley, Liz; Ferroni, Eliana; Hewak, Bill; Prabhala, Adi; Nair, Sreekumaran; Rivetti, Alessandro","journal":"Evid Based Child Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313518/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ebch.291","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread of respiratory viruses","respiratory virus spread","respiratory disease","respiratory virus epidemics","control studies","viral transmission of respiratory viruses","transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses","observational studies","hygienic measures","cohort studies","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Single measures","Non\u2010RCTs","time series studies","wide spread","Viral epidemics","highest quality cluster RCTs","randomised controlled trials","case","Antiviral drugs","social distancing","reduced transmission","mixed quality","control data","younger children","low\u2010cost interventions","major epidemics","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","lack of proper evaluation of global measures","SARS","isolation","barriers","Global pandemic viral infections","high risk of bias","looming epidemic","mixed risk of bias","titles","papers","new avian influenza pandemic","people worldwide contract influenza","simple surgical masks","firm conclusions","use of vaccines","Cochrane Library","MAIN RESULTS","minor disease","study designs","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","limited evidence","evidence of effectiveness","significant threat","DATA COLLECTION","expensive N95 masks","presence of potential confounders","screening","entry ports","antiseptics","quarantine","normal handwashing","allocation generation","concealment","virucidals","text articles","randomisation method","personal protection","pandemics","H5N1 strain","attack rates","household members","standardised form","Additional benefit","incremental effect","blinding","confounding","issue","abstracts","hygiene","economic crisis","PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY","ANALYSIS","vaccination","BACKGROUND","Routine long\u2010term implementation","SEARCH STRATEGY","catastrophe","eligibility","SELECTION CRITERIA","event","OBJECTIVES","OLDMEDLINE","EMBASE","CINAHL","transmission","insufficient evaluation of global measures","N95 masks","simple ones","uncertain benefit","children"],"language":"en"},

An adjudication committee composed of infectious disease specialists, pneumologists and radiologists blinded to PCR results reviewed patient records, including computed tomography and day 28 follow up, to categorize final diagnostic probability of CAP as definite, probable, possible, or excluded. Among the 254 patients enrolled, 78 (31%) had positive PCR, which detected viruses in 72/254 (28%) and intracellular bacteria in 8 (3%) patients.

In support of this long-term objective, our team developed TaqMan Array Cards (TACs) for testing postmortem specimens (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, lung tissue, respiratory tract swabs, and rectal swabs) for \u003E100 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targets in total (30\u201345 per card depending on configuration). Multipathogen panels were configured by syndrome and customized to include pathogens of significance in young children within the regions where CHAMPS is conducted, including bacteria (57 targets covering 30 genera), viruses (48 targets covering 40 viruses), parasites (8 targets covering 8 organisms), and fungi (3 targets covering 3 organisms). The development and application of multiplex real-time PCR reactions to the TAC microfluidic platform increased the number of targets in each panel while maintaining assay efficiency and replicates for heightened sensitivity. These advances represent a substantial improvement in the utility of this technology for infectious disease diagnostics and surveillance.

As students, we were facing a review of the literature for our dissertations. We encountered several different ways of conducting a review but were unable to locate any resources that synthesized all of the various synthesis methodologies. Our purpose is to present a comprehensive overview and assessment of the main approaches to research synthesis. We use \u2018research synthesis\u2019 as a broad overarching term to describe various approaches to combining, integrating, and synthesizing research findings. METHODS: We conducted an integrative review of the literature to explore the historical, contextual, and evolving nature of research synthesis. We searched five databases, reviewed websites of key organizations, hand-searched several journals, and examined relevant texts from the reference lists of the documents we had already obtained. RESULTS: We identified four broad categories of research synthesis methodology including conventional, quantitative, qualitative, and emerging syntheses. Each of the broad categories was compared to the others on the following: key characteristics, purpose, method, product, context, underlying assumptions, unit of analysis, strengths and limitations, and when to use each approach. CONCLUSIONS: The current state of research synthesis reflects significant advancements in emerging synthesis studies that integrate diverse data types and sources. New approaches to research synthesis provide a much broader range of review alternatives available to health and social science students and researchers.","publish_time":"2016-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schick-Makaroff, Kara; MacDonald, Marjorie; Plummer, Marilyn; Burgess, Judy; Neander, Wendy","journal":"AIMS Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2079a44557da9aa2ce74d6af8ac0e8a344c1ad8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5690272.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29546155/; https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2016.1.172","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current state of research synthesis","evolving nature of research synthesis","broad categories of research synthesis methodology","emerging synthesis studies","various synthesis methodologies","research methods course","synthesizing research findings","various approaches","integrative review","main approaches","purpose","New approaches","doctoral students","literature","social science students","broad overarching term","broader range of review alternatives available","key characteristics","emerging syntheses","reviewed websites of key organizations","health","significant advancements","underlying assumptions","product","context","faculty member","diverse data types","unit of analysis","hand","assessment","comprehensive overview","reference lists","relevant texts","journals","strengths","databases","researchers","limitations","process","following","CONCLUSIONS","documents","resources","different ways","RESULTS","dissertations","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Methods The antiviral activity of LH against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells using CPE and plaque reduction assay. The effect of LH on virion morphology was visualized under transmission electron microscope. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. Results LH significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Furthermore, LH treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of virion in cells. Conclusions LH significantly inhibits the SARS-COV-2 replication, affects virus morphology and exerts anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. These findings indicate that LH protects against the virus attack, making its use a novel strategy for controlling the COVID-19 disease.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Runfeng, Li; Yunlong, Hou; Jicheng, Huang; Weiqi, Pan; Qinhai, Ma; Yongxia, Shi; Chufang, Li; Jin, Zhao; Zhenhua, Jia; Haiming, Jiang; Kui, Zheng; Shuxiang, Huang; Jun, Dai; Xiaobo, Li; Xiaotao, Hou; Lin, Wang; Nanshan, Zhong; Zifeng, Yang","journal":"Pharmacological Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ba7ca9fc65acc03c64948018ddcd5da54e94203.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102548.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S104366182030743X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104366182030743X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32205232/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LH","CPE"],"locations":["Vero"],"keyphrases":["effect of LH","antiviral activity of LH","LH treatment","Results LH","Conclusions LH","novel SARS-CoV","inhibited SARS-CoV","virus morphology","Vero E6 cells","virion morphology","replication","virus attack","anti-inflammatory activity","abnormal particle morphology of virion","exerted broad-spectrum antiviral effects","pro-inflammatory cytokines","Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels","immune regulatory effects Ding","potential effect","novel strategy","mRNA levels","series of influenza viruses","host immune response","traditional Chinese medicine","CPE","TNF-\u03B1","formula","plaque reduction assay","IL","TCM","Abstract Purpose Lianhuaqingwen","real-time quantitative PCR assays","transmission electron microscope","CCL","production","COVID","study","Methods","infection","CXCL","MCP","IP","disease","goal","findings"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN: This was an observational cohort study in two primary care pediatric practices in Madison, WI. Nasal samples were obtained during 4 asymptomatic surveillance visits and during symptomatic URIs. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay for 9 respiratory viruses was performed on nasal samples. A diagnosis of sinusitis was based on published criteria. RESULTS: 236 children ages 48-96 months were enrolled. A total of 327 URIs were characterized. The mean number of URIs per child was 1.3 (range 0-9) per year. Viruses were detected in 81% of URIs; rhinovirus (RV) was most common. Seventy-two percent of URIs were resolved clinically by the tenth day. RV-A and RV-C were detected more frequently at URI visits; RV-B was detected at the same rate for both asymptomatic surveillance visits and URI visits. Sinusitis was diagnosed in 8.8% of symptomatic URIs. Viruses were detected frequently (33%) in samples from asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Sinusitis occured in 8.8% of symptomatic URIs in our study. The virus most frequently detected with URIs in children was RV; RV-A and RV-C detection but not RV-B detection were associated with illness.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a negative regulator of angiotensin II in the renin\u2013angiotensin system, has been reported to have a crucial role in ALI. Downregulation of ACE2 is always associated with the ALI or ARDS induced by avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and sepsis. However, the molecular mechanism of the decreased expression of ACE2 in ALI is unclear. Here we show that avian influenza virus H5N1 induced the upregulation of miR-200c-3p, which was then demonstrated to target the 3\u2032-untranslated region of ACE2. Then, we found that nonstructural protein 1 and viral RNA of H5N1 contributed to the induction of miR-200c-3p during viral infection. Additionally, the synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA (poly (I:C)), bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid can all markedly increase the expression of miR-200c-3p in a nuclear factor-\u03BAB-dependent manner. Furthermore, markedly elevated plasma levels of miR-200c-3p were observed in severe pneumonia patients. The inhibition of miR-200c-3p ameliorated the ALI induced by H5N1 virus infection in vivo, indicating a potential therapeutic target. Therefore, we identify a shared mechanism of viral and bacterial lung infection-induced ALI/ARDS via nuclear factor-\u03BAB-dependent upregulation of miR-200c-3p to reduce ACE2 levels, which leads increased angiotensin II levels and subsequently causes lung injury.","publish_time":"2017-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Qiang; Du, Jianchao; Yu, Xuezhong; Xu, Jun; Huang, Fengming; Li, Xiaoyun; Zhang, Cong; Li, Xiao; Chang, Jiahui; Shang, Daozhen; Zhao, Yan; Tian, Mingyao; Lu, Huijun; Xu, Jiantao; Li, Chang; Zhu, Huadong; Jin, Ningyi; Jiang, Chengyu","journal":"Cell Discov","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b530925f860fe1a3191519482c19e8240834caf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5485385.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/celldisc.2017.21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28690868/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","expression of miR","ACE2 levels","bacterial lung infection-induced ALI","H5N1 virus infection","Influenza infection","induction of miR","inhibition of miR","dependent upregulation of miR","avian influenza virus H5N1","ARDS","viral RNA of H5N1","Downregulation of ACE2","elevated plasma levels of miR","respiratory syncytial virus","decreased expression of ACE2","increased angiotensin","angiotensin system","severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","severe form of acute lung injury","shared mechanism of viral","acute respiratory distress syndrome","untranslated region of ACE2","nuclear factor-\u03BAB","severe pneumonia patients","negative regulator of angiotensin","synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA","bacterial lipopolysaccharide","dependent manner","molecular mechanism","potential therapeutic target","sepsis","renin","mortality","lipoteichoic acid","nonstructural protein","crucial role","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0\u201316 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients\u0027 epidemiological and clinical features. FINDINGS: From Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8\u00B73 [SD 3\u00B75] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]). Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]). Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38\u00B75\u00B0C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37\u00B75\u201338\u00B75\u00B0C. Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]). Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB. All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir\u2013ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation. Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured. INTERPRETATION: Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.

Previous studies have shown that peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) can be an effective antiviral against the PRRS virus (PRRSV). PPMO is structurally similar to DNA with modified backbone and is resistant to nuclease. This study was designed to examine increasing inhibitory effect of PPMO combination. Two pairs of PPMOs were identified to have enhanced suppression of PRRSV replication in cell culture, while individual constituents did not work under the same testing conditions. PPMO 5UP1 that is complementary to 5\u2032 terminus of PRRSV genome was paired with 4P1 or 7P1 that are complementary to sequence in the translation initiation regions of ORFs 4 and 7, respectively. The PPMO combination also inhibited replication of heterologous strains in the North American PRRSV genotype. Treatment of the cells with the combinations reduced PRRSV RNA and protein levels. In cell-free or cell-based luciferase reporter assays, the PPMO combination suppressed target mRNA translation more effectively than individual constituents, indicating that the suppression was due to their antisense effect. These results suggest potential application of these PPMO combinations for PRRS control.","publish_time":"2009-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Xue; Fan, Sumin; Patel, Deendayal; Zhang, Yan-Jin","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/859ffa8109b72b1b18ebe76c76cfd32c8783d92f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114178.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19428596/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354209000278; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209000278; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.01.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPMO","PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPMO combinations","PPMO 5UP1","inhibitory effect of PPMO combination","PRRSV RNA","PRRS control","enhanced suppression of PRRSV replication","PRRS virus","terminus of PRRSV genome","cell culture","cell-free","North American PRRSV genotype","individual constituents","antisense effect","cell-based luciferase reporter assays","replication of heterologous strains","target mRNA translation","translation initiation regions of ORFs","swine industry","respiratory syndrome","peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer","heavy economic losses","modified backbone","current strategies","sequence","DNA","potential application","effective antiviral","7P1","4P1","cells","protein levels","nuclease","results","Previous studies","pairs of PPMOs","Treatment","testing conditions","study"],"language":"en"},

In this Review, we discuss the potential threat of bioterrorism, agents that could be exploited, and recent developments in technologies and policy for detecting and controlling epidemics that have been initiated intentionally. The local and international response to infectious disease epidemics, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome and west African Ebola virus epidemic, revealed serious shortcomings which bioterrorists might exploit when intentionally initiating an epidemic. Development of new vaccines and antimicrobial therapies remains a priority, including the need to expedite clinical trials using new methodologies. Better means to protect health-care workers operating in dangerous environments are also needed, particularly in areas with poor infrastructure. New and improved approaches should be developed for surveillance, early detection, response, effective isolation of patients, control of the movement of potentially infected people, and risk communication. Access to dangerous pathogens should be appropriately regulated, without reducing progress in the development of countermeasures. We conclude that preparedness for intentional outbreaks has the important added value of strengthening preparedness for natural epidemics, and vice versa.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Green, Manfred S; LeDuc, James; Cohen, Daniel; Franz, David R","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/364891a0374c2c6f12b0fbe99c514f3653a2d165.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106434.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309918302986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340981/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(18)30298-6; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309918302986","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["African Ebola"],"keyphrases":["preparedness","Development of new vaccines","natural epidemics","new methodologies","risk of bioterrorism","infectious disease epidemics","potential threat of bioterrorism","international response","growing threat","dangerous environments","risk communication","dangerous pathogens","development of countermeasures","African Ebola virus epidemic","important added value","severe acute respiratory syndrome","effective isolation of patients","serious shortcomings","control","surveillance","early detection","intentional outbreaks","antimicrobial therapies","infected people","movement","priority","policy","clinical trials","need","world security","Summary Global terrorism","health-care workers","recent developments","technologies","bioterrorists","improved approaches","agents","areas","poor infrastructure","Access","progress","Review"],"language":"en"},

The polyprotein is proposed to be processed by viral proteinases to generate the functional replicase complex. To date, only the MHV-JHM amino-terminal proteins p28 and p72, which is processed to p65, have been identified. To further elucidate the biogenesis of the MHV-JHM replicase, we cloned and expressed five regions of ORF1a in bacteria and prepared rabbit antisera to each region. Using the immune sera to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled proteins from MHV-JHM infected cells, we determined that the MHV-JHM ORF1a is initially processed to generate p28, p72, p250, and p150. Pulse\u2013chase analysis revealed that these intermediates are further processed to generate p65, p210, p40, p27, the MHV 3C-like proteinase, and p15. A putative replicase complex consisting of p250, p210, p40, p150, and a large protein (\u003E300 kDa) coprecipitate from infected cells disrupted with NP-40, indicating that these proteins are closely associated even after initial proteolytic processing. Immunofluorescence studies revealed punctate labeling of ORF1a proteins in the perinuclear region of infected cells, consistent with a membrane-association of the replicase complex. Furthermore,in vitrotranscription/translation studies of the MHV-JHM 3Cpro and flanking hydrophobic domains confirm that 3C protease activity is significantly enhanced in the presence of canine microsomal membranes. Overall, our results demonstrate that the MHV-JHM ORF1a polyprotein: (1) is processed into more than 10 protein intermediates and products, (2) requires membranes for efficient biogenesis, and (3) is detected in discrete membranous regions in the cytoplasm of infected cells.","publish_time":"1998-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schiller, Jennifer J.; Kanjanahaluethai, Amornrat; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b7491d63549cf2643cdaae2441623d7bac20587.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682297990103; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297990103","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-JHM replicase","MHV-JHM infected cells","MHV-JHM ORF1a polyprotein","MHV-JHM amino-terminal proteins p28","regions of ORF1a","cytoplasm of infected cells","functional replicase complex","putative replicase complex","replicase of mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM","punctate labeling of ORF1a proteins","perinuclear region of infected cells","immunoprecipitate radiolabeled proteins","p250","p72","p40","p210","p150","protein intermediates","p65","kDa precursor polyprotein","Immunofluorescence studies","translation studies","large protein","efficient biogenesis","C protease activity","discrete membranous regions","presence of canine microsomal membranes","hydrophobic domains","prepared rabbit antisera","overlapping open reading frames","bacteria","membrane-association","coprecipitate","p27","immune sera","ORF1b","Cpro","viral proteinases","chase analysis","products","vitrotranscription","NP","initial proteolytic processing","Pulse","date","results"],"language":"en"},

The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressively expanded from China, involving several countries throughout the world, leading to the classification of the disease as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to published reports, COVID-19 severity and mortality are higher in elderly patients and those with active comorbidities. In particular, lung cancer patients were reported to be at high risk of pulmonary complications related to SARS-CoV2 infection. Therefore, the management of cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic is a crucial issue, to which national and international oncology organizations have replied with recommendations concerning patients receiving anticancer treatments, delaying follow-up visits and limiting caregiver admission to the hospitals. In this historical moment, medical oncologists are required to consider the possibility to delay active treatment administration based on a case-by-case risk/benefit evaluation. Potential risks associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered, considering tumor histology and natural course, disease setting, clinical conditions, and disease burden, together with the expected benefit, toxicities (e.g., myelosuppression or interstitial lung disease), and response obtained from the planned or ongoing treatment. In this study, we report the results of proactive measures including social media, telemedicine, and telephone triage for screening patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak in the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy). Proactive management and containment measures, applied in a structured and daily way, has significantly aided the identification of advance patients with suspected symptoms related to COVID-19, limiting their admission to our cancer center; we have thus been more able to protect other patients from possible contamination and at the same time guarantee to the suspected patients the immediate treatment and evaluation in referral hospitals for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Marinis, Filippo; Attili, Ilaria; Morganti, Stefania; Stati, Valeria; Spitaleri, Gianluca; Gianoncelli, Letizia; Del Signore, Ester; Catania, Chiara; Rampinelli, Cristiano; Omodeo Sal\u00E8, Emanuela; Spaggiari, Lorenzo; Mastrilli, Fabrizio; Passaro, Antonio","journal":"Front Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1148e02bb3dd950414027661da6770f4cd93c09c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188943.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.00665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391282/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","European Institute of Oncology"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","lung cancer patients","suspected patients","elderly patients","screening patients","disease setting","identification of advance patients","disease burden","interstitial lung disease","spread of coronavirus disease","cancer center","management of cancer care","immediate treatment","pandemic","case risk","benefit evaluation","SARS-CoV2 infection","active treatment administration","ongoing treatment","Proactive management","results of proactive measures","suspected symptoms","novel coronavirus","containment measures","referral hospitals","expected benefit","caregiver admission","active comorbidities","European Institute of Oncology","international oncology organizations","World Health Organization","high risk of pulmonary complications","telemedicine","telephone triage","social media","natural course","clinical conditions","severe acute respiratory syndrome","severity","recommendations","follow-up visits","anticancer treatments","tumor histology","time guarantee","response","myelosuppression","mortality","outbreak","Milan","toxicities","crucial issue","possible contamination","possibility","medical oncologists","historical moment","Italy","published reports","classification","daily way","Potential risks","countries","China","study"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, a concern for an infectious nidus led to left cranial lung lobectomy at 9 months of age. Histopathology predominantly revealed polypoid and constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans (i.e., small airway disease). Intermittent antimicrobial administration over the next 5 years failed to blunt progressive clinical signs. At 8 years, necropsy confirmed severe airway-centered interstitial fibrosis. This pattern of fibrosis was strongly suggestive of underlying small airway disease as the trigger. In retrospect, post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO), a syndrome in young children caused by pulmonary infections but not yet recognized in pet dogs, likely initiated a pathway of fibrosis in this dog. In dogs with risk factors for community-acquired pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica, PIBO is a differential diagnosis with development of severe, persistent respiratory signs incompletely responsive to appropriate antimicrobials.

CD13 is expressed by granulocytes and monocytes and their precursors. CD13 is a marker for most acute myeloid leukaemias and a smaller proportion of acute lymphoid leukaemias. Various nonhematopoietic cells express CD13, including epithelial cells from renal proximal tubules and intestinal brush border, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, brain cells, bone marrow stromal cells, osteoclasts, and cells lining the biliary caniculae. CD13 is a member of a group of type II integral membrane metalloproteases that includes the leucocyte antigens CD10, CD26, CD73, and BP-1. The CD13 glycoprotein has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region that functions as a signal peptide, and a large C-terminal extracellular region that contains 11 N-linked glycosylation sites and also O-linked glycosylation. CD13 is a receptor for coronaviruses, RNA viruses that cause respiratory diseases in humans and several species of animals. The binding site on CD 13 for the swine coronavirus TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) is distinct from the enzymatic site. CD13 is a zinc-binding metalloprotease that plays a role in cell surface antigen presentation by trimming the N-terminal amino acids from MHC Class II-bound peptides.","publish_time":"1997-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barclay, A.

Antipyretic / analgesic drugs such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) are widely used to improve the comfort of the child but may cause medically unneeded antipyresis and rare but potentially serious side effects. We assess whether treatment with Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs 7630 reduces the administration of paracetamol in children with acute tonsillopharyngitis (ATP) or acute bronchitis (AB). DESIGN: Meta-analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials. METHODS: We searched clinical trial registries (ISRCTN, ClinicalTrials.gov) and medical literature (MEDLINE, EMBASE), for randomised, placebo-controlled trials investigating the administration of EPs 7630 to children with ATP or AB and reporting the co-administration of paracetamol. Based on the individual participant data of the eligible trials, study populations were characterized according to sex and age, and meta-analyses were performed for cumulative paracetamol use and ability to attend school at treatment end. RESULTS: Six trials including a total of 523 children aged 6\u201310 years (EPs 7630: 265; placebo: 258) and suffering from non-\u03B2-hemolytic streptococcal ATP (3 trials) or from AB (3 trials) were identified and eligible. Children received EPs 7630 or placebo for 6 (ATP) or 7 days (AB). Compared to placebo, EPs 7630 reduced the cumulative dose of paracetamol in 5 out of the 6 trials, by an average of 244 mg (Hedges\u2019 g; \u2212 0.28; 95% confidence interval: [\u2212 0.53; \u2212 0.02]; p \u003C 0.03). At treatment end, 30.2% (EPs 7630) and 74.4% (placebo) of the children were still unable to attend school (risk ratio: 0.43; 95% confidence interval: [0.29; 0.65]; p \u003C 0.001).

Numerous investigations have demonstrated that portable air cleaning devices can reduce concentrations of asthma triggers in indoor air; however, their benefits for breathing problems have not always been reproducible. The potential exposure benefits of whole house high efficiency in-duct air cleaners for sensitive subpopulations have yet to be evaluated. METHODS: We used an indoor air quality modeling system (CONTAM) developed by NIST to examine peak and time-integrated concentrations of common asthma triggers present in indoor air over a year as a function of natural ventilation, portable air cleaners, and forced air ventilation equipped with conventional and high efficiency filtration systems. Emission rates for asthma triggers were based on experimental studies published in the scientific literature. RESULTS: Forced air systems with high efficiency filtration were found to provide the best control of asthma triggers: 30\u201355% lower cat allergen levels, 90\u201399% lower risk of respiratory infection through the inhalation route of exposure, 90\u201398% lower environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) levels, and 50\u201375% lower fungal spore levels than the other ventilation/filtration systems considered. These results indicate that the use of high efficiency in-duct air cleaners provide an effective means of controlling allergen levels not only in a single room, like a portable air cleaner, but the whole house. CONCLUSION: These findings are useful for evaluating potential benefits of high efficiency in-duct filtration systems for controlling exposure to asthma triggers indoors and for the design of trials of environmental interventions intended to evaluate their utility in practice.","publish_time":"2008-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Myatt, Theodore A; Minegishi, Taeko; Allen, Joseph G; MacIntosh, David L","journal":"Environ Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52264dd990e495e82f511cfa80a14b52ec063722.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2543006.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18684328/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-069x-7-43","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["air systems","air ventilation","duct air cleaners","portable air cleaners","concentrations of asthma triggers","asthma exacerbations","asthma symptoms","high efficiency filtration systems","house high efficiency","portable air cleaning devices","potential benefits of high efficiency","best control of asthma triggers","use of high efficiency","duct filtration systems","indoor air quality modeling system","potential exposure benefits","time-integrated concentrations of common asthma triggers present","lower cat allergen levels","lower fungal spore levels","lower environmental tobacco smoke","effective means of controlling allergen levels","environmental agents","inhalation route of exposure","environmental interventions","RESULTS","lower risk of respiratory infection","function of natural ventilation","CONTAM","year","important component","experimental studies","lead","ETS","single room","NIST","peak","findings","strategy","design of trials","sensitive subpopulations","Numerous investigations","scientific literature","utility","breathing problems","BACKGROUND","Emission rates","CONCLUSION","individuals","METHODS","practice"],"language":"en"},

Focussing on recent progress in revitalisation of industrial buildings in Hong Kong, this research investigates the Government regulations and market responses. It is found that simply relieving the regulations and institutional constraints in revitalisation does not work, either for the policy aim in a narrow sense or for the local economy in a broad sense. New revitalisation measures by the Government have led to new constraints in revitalisation. It is necessary to address the policy lag.

Strain identification was characterised by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the amplified hypervariable region of the spike 1 (S1) gene. These five IBV isolates were found to be of the IBV strain CK/CH/LDL/97I. Nucleotide identity between these five IBV isolates ranged from 96.9% to 99.7%, and between these isolates and the CK/CH/LDL/97I strain in the range of 96.6\u201399.1%.

Interactions can be static, such as spatial overlap, or dynamic based on the interactions of movements, and can be mediated through communication, such as the deployment of scent marks. Interactions and their behavioural outcomes can be difficult to determine, especially for species that live at low densities. With the use of GPS collars we quantify both static and dynamic interactions between male cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and the behavioural outcomes. The 99% home-ranges of males overlapped significantly while there was little overlap of the 50% home-ranges. Despite this overlap, male cheetahs rarely came into close proximity of one another, possibly because presence was communicated through frequent visits to marking posts. The minimum distance between individuals in a dyad ranged from 89m to 196m but the average proximity between individuals ranged from 17,145 \u00B1 6,865m to 26,367 \u00B1 11,288m. Possible interactions took place more frequently at night than by day and occurred mostly in the 50% home-range of one individual of a dyad or where cores of both individuals overlapped. After a possible encounter male cheetahs stayed in close proximity to each other for up to 6 hours, which could be the result of a territory defence strategy or the presence of a receptive female. We believe that one of the encounters between a singleton and a 5-male coalition resulted in the death of the singleton. Our results give new insights into cheetah interactions, which could help our understanding of ecological processes such as disease transmission.","publish_time":"2019-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broekhuis, Femke; Madsen, Emily K.; Keiwua, Kosiom; Macdonald, David W.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a52566f6d96ec5a9a371582766a992a4ac38bd64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6447186.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30943236/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213910","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dynamic interactions","Possible interactions","cheetah interactions","interactions of movements","Intraspecific interactions","groups of individuals","possible encounter male cheetahs","male coalition","close proximity","home-ranges","presence","species","dyad","behavioural outcomes","spatial overlap","average proximity","little overlap","singleton","Acinonyx jubatus","territory defence strategy","understanding of ecological processes","results","new insights","important component of population dynamics","disease transmission","frequent visits","use of GPS collars","night","males","death","minimum distance","cores","place","receptive female","deployment of scent marks","posts","low densities","communication","day","hours","encounters"],"language":"en"},

The lethal pathology associated with FIP (granulomatous inflammation and T-cell lymphopenia) is thought to be mediated by aberrant modulation of the immune system due to infection of cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs in cats with FIP, and has been suggested to play a significant role in the disease process. However, the mechanism underlying this process remains unknown. Here we show that infection of primary blood-derived feline mononuclear cells by FIPV WSU 79-1146 and FIPV-DF2 leads to rapid activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and that this activation regulates production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). FIPV-induced p38 MAPK activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production was inhibited by the pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors SB 203580 and SC 409 in a dose-dependent manner. FIPV-induced p38 MAPK activation was observed in primary feline blood-derived mononuclear cells individually purified from multiple SPF cats, as was the inhibition of TNF-alpha production by pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors.","publish_time":"2009-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Regan, Andrew D.; Cohen, Rebecca D.; Whittaker, Gary R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c9f7f000678d675ea274867fc737f53ce4d7d95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103373.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208007356; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.11.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19058829/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208007356","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV WSU","SC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIPV-induced p38 MAPK activation","alpha production","feline coronavirus","infection of cells","FIPV WSU","FIPV-DF2","pro-inflammatory cytokine production","infection of primary blood-derived feline mononuclear cells","primary feline blood-derived mononuclear cells","rapid activation","TNF-alpha","feline infectious peritonitis virus","Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis","p38 MAPK pathway","pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha","Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines","systemic infection","fatal disease of cats","disease process","beta","pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors SB","multiple SPF cats","inhibition of TNF","FCoV","granulomatous inflammation","SC","immune system","T-cell lymphopenia","interleukin","lethal pathology","aberrant modulation","significant role","IL","monocytes","dose-dependent manner","mechanism","macrophages"],"language":"en"},

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR\u002BQ). The SEIR\u002BQ dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR\u002BQ dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12\u201314, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Yongyue; Wei, Liangmin; Jiang, Yue; Shen, Sipeng; Zhao, Yang; Hao, Yuantao; Du, Zhicheng; Tang, Jinling; Zhang, Zhijie; Jiang, Qingwu; Li, Liming; Chen, Feng; Shen, Hongbing","journal":"Engineering (Beijing)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e062f4241789be2bf8795af450c697683828afe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204764.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809920301077?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382449/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.04.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095809920301077","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["number of cases","number of infections","unconfirmed cases","Q dynamics model","daily new cases","cases fewer","majority of cases","observed number of cumulative confirmed cases","number of daily new diagnosed cases","epidemic control","model predictions","city of Wuhan","transmission dynamics model","implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria","universal symptom surveys","epidemic data","daily reported number of confirmed infections","implementation of clinical diagnostics","Effective reproductive number R","proposed SEIR","combination of epidemic mitigation","observed frequencies","observed case","trend","coronavirus disease","control measures","large increase","rapid increase","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","analysis","good fit","remarkable decline","quarantined compartments","SARS-CoV","contraction","deaths","magnitude","China","predicted count","COVID","conclusion","curve","duration","study","susceptibles"],"language":"en"},

However, evidence suggests that a high proportion of Twitter posts (ie, tweets) are not necessarily accurate, and many studies suggest that tweets do not need to be accurate, or at least evidence based, to receive traction. This is a dangerous combination in the sphere of health information. OBJECTIVE: The first objective of this study is to examine health-related tweets originating from Saudi Arabia in terms of their accuracy. The second objective is to find factors that relate to the accuracy and dissemination of these tweets, thereby enabling the identification of ways to enhance the dissemination of accurate tweets. The initial findings from this study and methodological improvements will then be employed in a larger-scale study that will address these issues in more detail. METHODS: A health lexicon was used to extract health-related tweets using the Twitter application programming interface and the results were further filtered manually. A total of 300 tweets were each labeled by two medical doctors; the doctors agreed that 109 tweets were either accurate or inaccurate. Other measures were taken from these tweets\u2019 metadata to see if there was any relationship between the measures and either the accuracy or the dissemination of the tweets. The entire range of this metadata was analyzed using Python, version 3.6.5 (Python Software Foundation), to answer the research questions posed. RESULTS: A total of 34 out of 109 tweets (31.2%) in the dataset used in this study were classified as untrustworthy health information. These came mainly from users with a non-health care background and social media accounts that had no corresponding physical (ie, organization) manifestation. Unsurprisingly, we found that traditionally trusted health sources were more likely to tweet accurate health information than other users. Likewise, these provisional results suggest that tweets posted in the morning are more trustworthy than tweets posted at night, possibly corresponding to official and casual posts, respectively. Our results also suggest that the crowd was quite good at identifying trustworthy information sources, as evidenced by the number of times a tweet\u2019s author was tagged as favorited by the community. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate some initially surprising factors that might correlate with the accuracy of tweets and their dissemination. For example, the time a tweet was posted correlated with its accuracy, which may reflect a difference between professional (ie, morning) and hobbyist (ie, evening) tweets. More surprisingly, tweets containing a kashida\u2014a decorative element in Arabic writing used to justify the text within lines\u2014were more likely to be disseminated through retweets. These findings will be further assessed using data analysis techniques on a much larger dataset in future work.","publish_time":"2019-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albalawi, Yahya; Nikolov, Nikola S; Buckley, Jim","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6914129.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/14731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Python Software Foundation"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["accuracy of tweets","health-related tweets","dissemination of accurate tweets","accurate health information","dissemination of health information","health lexicon","sphere of health information","untrustworthy health information","trusted health sources","non-health care background","trustworthy information sources","provisional results","OBJECTIVE","larger-scale study","larger dataset","users","morning","evidence","measures","total","social media accounts","Social media platforms","high proportion of Twitter posts","corresponding physical","tweets\u2019 metadata","initial findings","casual posts","medical doctors","surprising factors","Python Software Foundation","Twitter application programming interface","vital role","Saudi Arabia","version","Arabic writing","decorative element","tweet\u2019s author","text","data analysis techniques","kashida","terms","number of times","methodological improvements","dangerous combination","organization","future work","difference","crowd","hobbyist","night","identification of ways","manifestation","entire range","example","lines","issues","METHODS","evening","studies","research questions","community","traction","relationship","retweets","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

CoV infection requires spike proteins, which bind viruses to host cell receptors and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. Several CoV strains have spike proteins with two receptor-binding domains, an S1A that engages host sialic acids and an S1B that recognizes host transmembrane proteins. As this bivalent binding may enable broad zoonotic CoV infection, we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages. Focusing on two betacoronaviruses, murine JHM-CoV and human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by sialic acids; however, the transmembrane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection. These results favored a two-step process in which viruses first adhere to sialic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry. However, sialic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell-cell membrane fusion, without requiring protein receptors. This virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive S1A mutations. Overall, these findings reveal roles for sialic acids in virus-cell binding, viral spike protein-directed cell-cell fusion, and resultant spread of CoV infections.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qing, Enya; Hantak, Michael; Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Tom","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fa90782b0cd99871663f5317bb69d255cfde50f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7018658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32047128/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02764-19","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["cell receptors","cell-cell fusion","virus-cell binding","cell-cell membrane fusion","virus-cell membrane fusion","host sialic acids","transmembrane protein receptors","subsequent virus infection","prototype protein receptors","virus particle binding","MERS-CoV","CoV strains","infectious cell entry","viral spike protein","spike proteins","broad zoonotic CoV infection","later stages of virus","resultant spread of CoV infections","murine JHM-CoV","host transmembrane proteins","bivalent binding","receptor-binding domains","distinct infection stages","roles","subsequent engagement","human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","adaptive S1A mutations","severe respiratory disease syndromes","S1B","cells","animal pathogens","CoVs","absence","two-step process","betacoronaviruses","findings","results"],"language":"en"},

Viral agents are one of the main causes of acute diarrhea, particularly in infants and young children. Astrovirus, coronavirus, torovirus, and picobirnavirus are increasingly being identified as causative agents of gastroenteritis. Astroviruses have been detected in the stools of between 1.2 % and 20 % of children with diarrhea requiring medical care in a variety of geographical areas. Outbreaks have been described in schools, day care settings and pediatric wards. Children younger than 3 years old are the most frequently affected. In temperate climates incidence is greater in winter whereas in tropical areas infection occurs throughout the year. Transmission is mainly through the fecal-oral route. At least seven serotypes of human astroviruses have been recognized and serotype 1 is more common than the other serotypes. Astroviruses are often shed in stools during long periods and can be detected by electron microscopy. An enzyme-immunoassay technique that detects the astrovirus group antigen has been widely used in epidemiological studies. Nucleic acid hybridization and polymerase chain reaction-based techniques have also been used. Enteric coronaviruses have most frequently been associated with gastrointestinal disease in neonates and children younger than 12 years old.

Vaccines contribute to a healthy community and robust health system; the Ebola outbreak has raised awareness of the threat and damage one single infectious disease can make, and it is clear that the world was not prepared. However, more research to better understand emerging infectious agents might lead to suitable vaccines which help prevent future outbreaks. DCVMN members presented their progress in developing novel vaccines against Dengue, HPV, Chikungunya, Cholera, cell-based influenza and other vaccines, demonstrating the commitment towards eliminating and eradicating preventable diseases worldwide through global collaboration and technology transfer. The successful introduction of novel Sabin-IPV and Oral Cholera vaccine in China and Korea respectively in 2015 was highlighted. In order to achieve global immunisation, local authorities and community leaders play an important role in the decision-making in vaccine introduction and uptake, based on the ability of vaccines to protect vaccinated people and protect non-vaccinated in the community through herd immunity. Reducing the risk of vaccine shortages can also be achieved by increasing regulatory convergence at regional and international levels. Combatting preventable diseases remains challenging, and collective efforts for improving multi-centre clinical trials, creating regional vaccine security strategies, fostering developing vaccine markets and procurement, and building trust in vaccines were discussed.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pagliusi, Sonia; Ting, Ching-Chia; Khomvilai, Sumana; Homma, Akira; Meng, Li; Suhardono, Mahendra; Tippoo, Patrick; Jadhav, Suresh; Gao, Steven; Prasad, Ray; Suri, Rajinder K.; Thai, Pan Hong; Vonghangool, Vitoon","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bef591a0af76de32c50959f47cd4d9261a09015.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127051.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.02.067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26947496/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16002620; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16002620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DCVMN"],"locations":["China","Korea"],"keyphrases":["vaccine introduction","novel vaccines","suitable vaccines","quality vaccines","ability of vaccines","developing vaccine markets","Oral Cholera vaccine","risk of vaccine shortages","regional vaccine security strategies","Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network","community leaders","global immunisation","global health organisations","healthy community","global collaboration","vaccinated people","preventable diseases","high-profile leaders","DCVMN members","successful introduction of novel Sabin-IPV","robust health system","emerging infectious agents","single infectious disease","cell-based influenza","multi-centre clinical trials","collective efforts","threat","local authorities","Chikungunya","Dengue","HPV","important role","Ebola outbreak","damage","decision-making","China","progress","procurement","common goal","awareness","regulatory convergence","international levels","uptake","Korea","Annual General Meeting","technology transfer","herd immunity","research","order","future outbreaks","trust","commitment","world"],"language":"en"},

Thailand is an important point of focus in terms of global pandemic preparedness and response due to its role as the major transportation hub for Southeast Asia, the endemic presence of multiple types of influenza, and its role as a major receiving country for migrants. Our aim was to collect information about vulnerable migrants\u2019 perceptions of and ability to implement NPIs proposed by the WHO. We hope that this information will help us to gauge the capacity of this population to engage in pandemic preparedness and response efforts, and to identify potential barriers to NPI effectiveness. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was performed. The study was conducted during the influenza H1N1 2009 pandemic and included 801 migrant participants living in border areas thought to be high risk by the Thailand Ministry of Public Health. Data were collected by Migrant Community Health Workers using a 201-item interviewer-assisted questionnaire. Univariate descriptive analyses were conducted. RESULTS: With the exception of border measures, to which nearly all participants reported they would be adherent, attitudes towards recommended NPIs were generally negative or uncertain. Other potential barriers to NPI implementation include limited experience applying these interventions (e.g., using a thermometer, wearing a face mask) and inadequate hand washing and household disinfection practices. CONCLUSIONS: Negative or ambivalent attitudes towards NPIs combined with other barriers identified suggest that vulnerable migrants in Thailand have a limited capacity to participate in pandemic preparedness efforts. This limited capacity likely puts migrants at risk of propagating the spread of a pandemic virus. Coordinated risk communication and public education are potential strategies that may reduce barriers to individual NPI implementation.","publish_time":"2014-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hickey, Jason; Gagnon, Anita J; Jitthai, Nigoon","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/403d1861771bf1e5e3625b0f86247d7134c3873d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4090173.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973943/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Thailand Ministry of Public Health","Migrant Community Health Workers","NPI"],"locations":["Southeast Asia","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["pandemic preparedness efforts","potential barriers","pandemic virus","limited capacity","terms of global pandemic preparedness","principal public health response","Thailand Ministry of Public Health","recommended NPIs","response efforts","influenza H1N1","public education","potential strategies","role","high risk","previous influenza","limited experience","individual NPI implementation","migrant participants","NPI effectiveness","information","Migrant Community Health Workers","Coordinated risk communication","border areas","ambivalent attitudes","endemic presence of multiple types of influenza","major transportation hub","vulnerable migrants\u2019 perceptions","Non-pharmaceutical interventions","major receiving country","exception of border measures","inadequate hand washing","Southeast Asia","key area of ongoing preparation","important point of focus","face mask","household disinfection practices","future pandemics","BACKGROUND","ability","spread","item interviewer","thermometer","CONCLUSIONS","Data","population","METHODS","cross-sectional survey","Univariate descriptive analyses","questionnaire","RESULTS","aim","study"],"language":"en"},

During the first half of the 20th century, microbiological quality control of lab animals was at best rudimentary as colonies were conventionally housed and little or no diagnostic testing was done. Hence, animal studies were often curtailed and confounded by infectious disease (Mobraaten and Sharp, 1999; Morse, 2007; Weisbroth, 1999). By the 1950s, it became apparent to veterinarians in the nascent field of comparative medicine that disease-free animals suitable for research could not be produced by standard veterinary disease control measures (e.g., improved sanitation and nutrition, antimicrobial treatments) in conventional facilities. Henry Foster, the veterinarian who founded Charles River Breeding Laboratories in 1948 and a pioneer in the large-scale production of laboratory rodents, stated in a seminar presented at the 30th anniversary of AALAS, \u201CAfter a variety of frustrating health-related problems, it was decided that a major change in the company\u2019s philosophy was required and an entirely different approach was essential\u201D. Consequently, he and others developed innovative biosecurity systems to eliminate and exclude pathogens (Allen, 1999). In 1958, Foster reported on the Cesarean-originated barrier-sustained (COBS) process for the large-scale production of specific pathogen-free (SPF) laboratory rodents (Foster, 1958). To eliminate horizontally transmitted pathogens, a hysterectomy was performed on a near-term dam from a contaminated or conventionally housed colony. The gravid uterus was pulled through a disinfectant solution into a sterile flexible film isolator where the pups were removed from the uterus and suckled on axenic (i.e., germ-free) foster dams. After being mated to expand their number and associated with a cocktail of nonpathogenic bacteria to normalize their physiology and prime their immune system, rederived rodents were transferred to so-called barrier rooms for large-scale production. The room-level barrier to adventitious infection entailed disinfection of the room, equipment, and supplies, limiting access to trained and properly gowned personnel, and the application of new technologies such as high-efficiency particulate air-filtration of incoming air (Dubos and Schaedler, 1960; Foster, 1980; Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983; Trexler and Orcutt, 1999). The axenic and associated rodents mentioned in the COBS process are collectively classified as gnotobiotic to indicate that they have a completely known microflora. By contrast, barrier-reared rodent colonies are not gnotobiotic because they are housed in uncovered cages and thus acquire a complex microflora from the environment, supplies, personnel, and other sources. Instead, they are described as SPF to indicate that according to laboratory testing, they are free from infection with a defined list of infectious agents, commonly known as an \u2018exclusion\u2019 list.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shek, William R.; Smith, Abigail L.; Pritchett-Corning, Kathleen R.","journal":"Laboratory Animal Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4544948ac508d9b1b6a98d5a18885af20a45b97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150201.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124095274000110; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095274000110","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Henry Foster","Schaedler"],"organizations":["Charles River Breeding Laboratories"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["large-scale production of laboratory rodents","associated rodents","foster dams","Henry Foster","rederived rodents","laboratory testing","room-level barrier","barrier-reared rodent colonies","large-scale production of specific pathogen-free","so-called barrier rooms","COBS process","Cesarean-originated barrier","supplies","infectious disease","research","Schaedler","SPF","gnotobiotic","Orcutt","housed colony","incoming air","adventitious infection","rodent species","defined list of infectious agents","gowned personnel","complex microflora","transmitted pathogens","gravid uterus","diagnostic testing","microbiological quality control of lab animals","standard veterinary disease control measures","disease-free animals suitable","high-efficiency particulate air-filtration","nascent field of comparative medicine","improved sanitation","antimicrobial treatments","disinfectant solution","disinfection","sterile flexible film isolator","Rattus norvegicus","rats","veterinarians","nutrition","application of new technologies","domestic rabbits","pups","century","Dubos","pioneer","Charles River Breeding Laboratories","Mus musculus","variety of frustrating health-related problems","physiology","Oryctolagus cuniculus","hysterectomy","immune system","Mobraaten","access","equipment","environment","contrast","company\u2019s philosophy","conventional facilities","near-term dam","cocktail of nonpathogenic bacteria","major change","Morse","Mice","uncovered cages","Trexler","seminar","innovative biosecurity systems","different approach","anniversary of AALAS","half","sources","animal studies","number","Weisbroth","Allen","exclusion","years"],"language":"en"},

The distribution of viruses in patients with ILI was investigated during the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic (A/H1N1p). From June 2009 to January 2010, 660 patients with suspected influenza were questioned and examined, and nasal swabs were collected. All patient samples were tested for influenza virus, and 286 negative nasal swabs were tested further for 18 other respiratory viruses using real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. Two waves of ILI were observed in the epidemic curve (weeks 35\u201342 and 42\u201349). At least eight viruses co\u2010circulated during this period: human rhinovirus (HRV) (58), parainfluenza 1\u20134 viruses (PIV) (9), human Coronavirus (hCoV) OC43 (9), enterovirus (5), adenovirus (AdV) (4), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (2); however, 204 samples remained negative for all viruses tested. ILI symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for ILI definition, were reported in 75% of cases. These patients had positive swabs for A/H1N1p, HRV, hCoV\u2010OC43, PIV, AdV, and hMPV without significant difference with non\u2010ILI patients. This study found that many respiratory viruses circulated during this period and that the A/H1N1p did not impact on the kinetics of other respiratory viruses. The proportion of non\u2010documented cases remains high. ILI could not distinguish A/H1N1p infection from that due to other respiratory viruses. However, in multivariate anlaysis, cough, chills, hyperemia, and dyspnea were associated significantly with influenza virus versus other respiratory viruses. J. Med.

However, little is known about how social capital may influence health-protective behavior in the general population. This study examined whether each of the social capital dimensions (bonding, bridging, and linking) contributed to the intention to adopt any of the health-protective behaviors in an influenza pandemic. The data of this study were from the 2014 Taiwan Social Change Survey. A stratified, three-stage probability proportional-to-size sampling from across the nation, was conducted to select adults aged 20 years and older (N = 1,745). Bonding social capital was measured by the frequency of neighborly contact and support. Bridging social capital was measured based on association membership. Linking social capital was measured according to general government trust and trust in the government\u2019s capacity to counter an influenza pandemic. Binary logistic regressions were used to assess the multivariate associations between social capital and behavioral intention. The study results indicate that social capital may influence the response to influenza pandemic. Specifically, the intention to receive a vaccine and to wash hands more frequently were associated with the linking dimension and the bonding dimension of social capital, while the intention to wear a face mask was associated with all forms of social capital. The findings of this study suggest that government credibility and interpersonal networks may play a crucial role in health-protective behavior.

More than one million people have been infected since the appearance of the virus in Brazil in 2015. Approximately 80% of infected patients are asymptomatic. An association with microcephaly and other birth defects as well as Guillain-Barre Syndrome has led to a World Health Organization declaration of Zika virus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Zika virus is a vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Male to female sexual transmission has been reported and there is potential for transmission via blood transfusions. After an incubation period of 2\u20137 days, symptomatic patients develop rapid onset fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis, often associated with headache and myalgias. Emergency department (ED) personnel must be prepared to address concerns from patients presenting with symptoms consistent with acute Zika virus infection, especially those who are pregnant or planning travel to Zika-endemic regions, as well as those women planning to become pregnant and their partners. The identify-isolate-inform (3I) tool, originally conceived for initial detection and management of Ebola virus disease patients in the ED, and later adjusted for measles and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, can be adapted for real-time use for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I tool for initial detection and management of patients under investigation for Zika virus. Following an assessment of epidemiologic risk, including travel to countries with mosquitoes that transmit Zika virus, patients are further investigated if clinically indicated. If after a rapid evaluation, Zika or other arthropod-borne diseases are the only concern, isolation (contact, droplet, airborne) is unnecessary. Zika is a reportable disease and thus appropriate health authorities must be notified. The modified 3I tool will facilitate rapid analysis and triggering of appropriate actions for patients presenting to the ED at risk for Zika.","publish_time":"2016-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koenig, Kristi L.; Almadhyan, Abdulmajeed; Burns, Michael J.","journal":"West J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f4d59790ebb50fad78486e25156bcbb6b1edb40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4899052.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27330653/; https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2016.3.30188","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Brazil","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Zika forest","acute Zika virus infection","management of patients","infected patients","management of Ebola virus disease patients","Zika-endemic regions","World Health Organization declaration of Zika virus","symptomatic patients","tool","reportable disease","pregnant women","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","initial detection","rapid analysis","appropriate health authorities","rapid evaluation","emerging infectious disease","travel","concerns","mosquitoes","rapid onset fever","international attention","Guillain-Barre Syndrome","appropriate actions","Emergency department","fetal microcephaly","following year","assessment of epidemiologic risk","female sexual transmission","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","symptoms consistent","maculopapular rash","days","countries","arthralgia","droplet","isolation","birth defects","measles","investigation","real-time use","conjunctivitis","contact","personnel","monkey","diseases","arthropod","Uganda","blood transfusions","association","appearance","vector","Aedes aegypti mosquito","headache","incubation period","modification","Brazil","myalgias","paper","people","partners","isolate"],"language":"en"},

With the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019-nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was shown that the RBD-ACE2 binding free energy for 2019-nCoV is significantly lower than that for SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Jiahua; Tao, Huanyu; Yan, Yumeng; Huang, Sheng-You; Xiao, Yi","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d697f0206dbcb0b0974a8c6a7841e956ea43d080.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.952903","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["nCoV binding","RBD of SARS","human SARS-CoV","binding ACE2","spike protein","human ACE2","RBD-ACE2 complex","protein-protein docking","binding site","higher temperature","free RBD systems","spike receptor binding domain","higher body-temperature","temperature-sensitive","rising temperature","terms of human infection","lower free energy","host cell infection","infection ability","evolution","higher entropy penalty","host cells","coronavirus envelope","molecular dynamics","new coronavirus","molecular mechanisms","vaccine development","continuous development","control","urgent antiviral treatments","MD","national public health crisis","virus vitality","drug","angiotensin","disease prevention","city of Wuhan","Hubei Province","vaccines","epidemic","simulations","enzyme","humans","outbreak of pneumonia","present findings","Previous studies","fact","addition","coronaviruses","insights","study","bats"],"language":"en"},

In this regard, in an effort to supplant antibiotics from bovine feeds, several alternatives were proposed including the use of immunomodulatory probiotics (immunobiotics). The purpose of this review is to provide an update of the status of the modulation of intestinal antiviral innate immunity of the bovine host by immunobiotics, and the beneficial impact of immunobiotics on viral infections, focused on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). The results of our group, which demonstrate the capacity of immunobiotic strains to beneficially modulate Toll-like receptor 3-triggered immune responses in bovine IECs and improve the resistance to viral infections, are highlighted.

By introducing the social preference theory, the target of this paper is to reveal the micro-interaction mechanism of public opinion polarization. Firstly, we divide the social preferences of Internet users (network nodes) into three categories: egoistic, altruistic, and fair preferences, and adopt the revenue function to define the benefits obtained by individuals with different preferences among their interaction process so as to analyze their decision-making behaviors driven by the revenue. Secondly, the revenue function is used to judge the exit rules of nodes in a network, and then a dynamic network of spreading public opinion with the node (individual) exit mechanism is built based on a BA scale-free network. Subsequently, the influences of different social preferences, as well as individual revenue on the effect of public opinion polarization, are analyzed through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that (1) Different social preferences demonstrate different influences on the evolution of public opinions, (2) Individuals tend to interact with ones with different preferences, (3) The network with a single preference or a high aggregation is more likely to form public opinion polarization. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by a real case.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Tinggui; Li, Qianqian; Fu, Peihua; Yang, Jianjun; Xu, Chonghuan; Cong, Guodong; Li, Gongfa","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0850c64c0da308f2f30ed9f9bca1f6eb4a6423d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7037295.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17030946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32033012/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different preferences","polarization of public opinion","influences of different social preferences","effect of public opinion polarization","fair preferences","different influences","network nodes","social preferences of Internet users","Social conflicts","micro-interaction mechanism of public opinion polarization","dynamic network","social preference theory","individual revenue","revenue function","evolution of public opinions","social transition period","BA scale-free network","individuals","exit rules of nodes","interaction process","single preference","simulation experiments","simulation results","benefits","proposed model","high aggregation","paper","categories","target","practicability","effectiveness","ones","real case","decision-making behaviors"],"language":"en"},

However, this hypothesis remains to be fully tested. Here, we studied 6 young and 12 old Chinese rhesus macaques (ChRM) over the course of three months after simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) SIVmac239 infection. Old ChRM showed a higher risk of accelerated AIDS development than did young macaques, owing to rapidly elevated plasma viral loads and decreased levels of CD4(\u002B) T cells. The low frequency of na\u00EFve CD4(\u002B) T cells before infection was strongly predictive of an increased disease progression, whereas the severe depletion of CD4(\u002B) T cells and the rapid proliferation of na\u00EFve lymphocytes accelerated the exhaustion of na\u00EFve lymphocytes in old ChRM. Moreover, in old ChRM, a robust innate host response with defective regulation was associated with a compensation for na\u00EFve T cell depletion and a high level of immune activation. Therefore, we suggest that immunosenescence plays an important role in the accelerated AIDS progression in elderly individuals and that SIV-infected old ChRM may be a favorable model for studying AIDS pathogenesis and researching therapies for elderly AIDS patients.","publish_time":"2017-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Hong-Yi; Zhang, Ming-Xu; Chen, Min; Jiang, Jin; Song, Jia-Hao; Lian, Xiao-Dong; Tian, Ren-Rong; Zhang, Xiao-Liang; Zhang, Lin-Tao; Pang, Wei; Zhang, Gao-Hong; Zheng, Yong-Tang","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bd22fc1297bd20710ca26f6e79b6339d576bb74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5428349.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28232735/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-00084-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accelerated AIDS progression","SIV-infected old ChRM","T cells","rapid AIDS progression","AIDS pathogenesis","elderly AIDS patients","na\u00EFve T cell depletion","HIV infection","exhaustion of na\u00EFve lymphocytes","rapid proliferation of na\u00EFve lymphocytes","old Chinese rhesus macaques","low frequency of na\u00EFve CD4","higher risk of accelerated AIDS development","severe depletion of CD4","young macaques","elderly individuals","SIVmac239 infection","elderly population","immunosenescence","decreased levels of CD4","increased disease progression","robust innate host response","simian immunodeficiency virus","elevated plasma viral loads","defective regulation","compensation","poor treatment outcome","favorable model","months","high level of immune activation","course","therapies","important role","aging","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Such technology allows for real-time evaluation of disease progression and when applied to studying infectious diseases may provide insight into pathogenesis. Insertion of a SPECT-compatible reporter gene into a virus may provide insight into mechanisms of pathogenesis and viral tropism. The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), a SPECT and positron emission tomography reporter gene, was inserted into Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a recently emerged virus that can cause severe respiratory disease and death in afflicted humans to obtain a quantifiable and sensitive marker for viral replication to further MERS-CoV animal model development. The recombinant virus was evaluated for fitness, stability, and reporter gene functionality. The recombinant and parental viruses demonstrated equal fitness in terms of peak titer and replication kinetics, were stable for up to six in vitro passages, and were functional. Further in vivo evaluation indicated variable stability, but resolution limits hampered in vivo functional evaluation. These data support the further development of hNIS for monitoring infection in animal models of viral disease. IMPORTANCE Advanced medical imaging such as single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) enhances fields such as oncology and cardiology. Application of SPECT/CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography to infectious disease may enhance pathogenesis studies and provide alternate biomarkers of disease progression. The experiments described in this article focus on insertion of a SPECT/CT-compatible reporter gene into MERS-CoV to demonstrate that a functional SPECT/CT reporter gene can be inserted into a virus.","publish_time":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chefer, Svetlana; Seidel, Jurgen; Cockrell, Adam S.; Yount, Boyd; Solomon, Jeffrey; Hagen, Katie R.; Liu, David X.; Huzella, Louis M.; Kumar, Mia R.; Postnikova, Elena; Bohannon, J.

The procedure embeds the MD energy profiles on a 2D Cartesian coordinates system using simple heuristic rules. At the same time, we associate the LN with a Markov matrix that describes the probabilities of passing from one state to other in the new 2D space. We construct this type of LNs for 422 MD trajectories obtained in DNA\u2013drug docking experiments of 57 furocoumarins. The combined use of psoralens\u002Bultraviolet light (UVA) radiation is known as PUVA therapy. PUVA is effective in the treatment of skin diseases such as psoriasis and mycosis fungoides. PUVA is also useful to treat human platelet (PTL) concentrates in order to eliminate Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi. Both are parasites that cause Leishmaniosis (a dangerous skin and visceral disease) and Chagas disease, respectively; and may circulate in blood products collected from infected donors. We included in this study both lineal (psoralens) and angular (angelicins) furocoumarins. In the study, we grouped the LNs on two sets; set1: DNA\u2013drug complex MD trajectories for active compounds and set2: MD trajectories of non-active compounds or no-optimal MD trajectories of active compounds. We calculated the respective \u03C0k (L) values for all these LNs and used them as inputs to train a new classifier that discriminate set1 from set2 cases.

Extensive clinical use of these drugs has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains, mainly in immunocompromised patients. This highlights the need for the development of new anti-herpesviral drugs with novel targets. Herein the effects of a plant anthraquinone, emodin, on the HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity and virus yields were investigated. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity was examined by nuclease activity assay. Inhibition of virus yields was measured by plaque reduction assay and immunohistochemical staining. Interaction between emodin and alkaline nuclease was analysed by docking technology. KEY RESULTS: Emodin specifically inhibited the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12 alkaline nuclease in a biochemical assay. Plaque reduction assay revealed that emodin reduced the plaque formation with an EC(50) of 21.5\u00B14.4 \u03BCM. Immunohistochemical staining using the anti-nucleocapsid protein antibody demonstrated that emodin induced the accumulation of viral nucleocapsids in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner. Docking analysis further suggested that the inhibitory effect of emodin on the UL12 activity may result from the interaction between emodin and critical catalytic amino acid residues of UL12. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that emodin is a potent anti-HSV agent that inhibits the yields of HSV-1 via the suppression of a novel target, UL12.","publish_time":"2009-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsiang, C-Y; Ho, T-Y","journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ab3be28a3e67aca45aede2cecae9339848254a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2538697.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18552872/; https://doi.org/10.1038/bjp.2008.242; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2538697?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nuclease activity of HSV","alkaline nuclease activity","nuclease activity assay","UL12 alkaline nuclease","UL12 activity","yields of HSV","inhibitory effect of emodin","plaque reduction assay","potent anti-HSV agent","biochemical assay","Inhibition of virus yields","Interaction","immunohistochemical staining","plaque formation","viral polymerase","herpes simplex virus","accumulation of viral nucleocapsids","development of new anti-herpesviral drugs","anti-nucleocapsid protein antibody","critical catalytic amino acid residues of UL12","novel targets","emergence of resistant viral strains","nucleus","antiviral therapies","infections","small group of nucleoside analogues","findings","suppression","immunocompromised patients","dose-dependent manner","plant anthraquinone","EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH","BACKGROUND","PURPOSE","Extensive clinical use","need","IMPLICATIONS","effects","KEY RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","analysis","technology","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

Several coronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), have been identified as the causative agents of these diseases. Effective measures to control these diseases are lacking. The major host cells of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus have thought to be epithelial cells on small intestine villi. Aminopeptidase-N (APN) has been described as the putative receptor for entry of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus into cells in vitro. Recently, Whitworth et al. have reported that APN knockout pigs are resistant to TGEV but not PEDV after weaning. However, it remains unclear if APN-null neonatal pigs are protected from TGEV. Here we report the generation of APN-null pigs by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer. APN-null pigs are produced with normal pregnancy rate and viability, indicating lack of APN is not embryonic lethal. After viral challenge, APN-null neonatal piglets are resistant to highly virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Histopathological analyses indicate APN-null pigs exhibit normal small intestine villi, while wildtype pigs show typical lesions in small intestines. Immunochemistry analyses confirm that no transmissible gastroenteritis virus antigen is detected in target tissues in APN-null piglets. However, upon porcine epidemic diarrhea virus challenge, APN-null pigs are still susceptible with 100% mortality. Collectively, this report provides a viable tool for producing animals with enhanced resistance to TGEV and clarifies that APN is dispensable for the PEDV infection in pigs.","publish_time":"2019-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Lei; Wang, Shaohua; Zhu, Lin; Fan, Baochao; Liu, Tong; Wang, Lefeng; Zhao, Panpan; Dang, Yanna; Sun, Pei; Chen, Jianwen; Zhang, Yunhai; Chang, Xinjian; Yu, Zhengyu; Wang, Huanan; Guo, Rongli; Li, Bin; Zhang, Kun","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6742759.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-49838-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515498/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APN","PEDV","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["APN-null pigs","APN-null neonatal pigs","APN knockout pigs","APN-null piglets","lack of APN","generation of APN","APN-null neonatal piglets","entry of transmissible gastroenteritis virus","virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus","transmissible gastroenteritis virus antigen","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus challenge","wildtype pigs","major host cells of transmissible gastroenteritis virus","TGEV","normal small intestine villi","small intestines","epithelial cells","Swine enteric diseases","PEDV infection","report","viral challenge","major threat","Histopathological analyses","Immunochemistry analyses","normal pregnancy rate","global swine industry","Cas9 technology","target tissues","CRISPR","typical lesions","somatic cell nuclear transfer","animals","enhanced resistance","viability","significant economic loss","viable tool","putative receptor","coronaviruses","causative agents","Effective measures","Aminopeptidase-N","Whitworth","weaning","mortality"],"language":"en"},

Replication of RVs is restricted in a host species-specific manner, and this barrier is determined predominantly by the host interferon (IFN) signaling and the ability of different RV strains to successfully negate IFN activation and amplification pathways. In addition, viral attachment to the target intestinal epithelial cells also regulates host range restriction. Several studies have focused on the role of the innate immune response in regulating RV replication and pathogenesis. The knowledge accrued from these efforts is likely to result in rational attenuation of RV vaccines to closely match circulating (and host species-matched) virus strains. In this chapter, we review prevalent models of RV interactions with innate immune factors, viral strategies employed to regulate their function, and the implications of these findings for improved RV vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sen, Adrish; Ding, Siyuan; Greenberg, Harry B.","journal":"Mucosal Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75662e9515101f5b72f81b1bdc2d3917b1338b24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148637.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128119242000419; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128119242000419","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rotaviruses"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV replication","host interferon","rational attenuation of RV vaccines","ability of different RV strains","viral attachment","prevalent models of RV interactions","viral strategies","improved RV vaccine development","host range restriction","host species-specific manner","Replication of RVs","important causative agents of viral gastroenteritis","innate immune response","innate immune factors","IFN activation","important cause of severe gastroenteritis","mammalian species","virus strains","effective vaccines","target intestinal epithelial cells","availability","findings","young","implications","role","barrier","circulating","Abstract Rotaviruses","efforts","amplification pathways","function","addition","pathogenesis","knowledge","chapter","humans","studies"],"language":"en"},

The process and problems in establishing a local skin bank will be described together with a retrospective review of skin allograft recipients to determine the efficacy of the programme. For the skin bank set-up, pertinent issues related to legislation, methods, logistics, quality assurance and donation rate are discussed. In this retrospective review, a comparison between patients who had early complete excision with skin allograft transplantation and those who received conventional staged excision and coverage, was analysed in terms of clinical profile and outcome using statistical methods.

The establishment of the skin bank has helped in the management of severe burn patients by facilitating early excision and allografting. In a Burn Centre, therefore, it is essential to have an ample supply of skin allograft for burn victims in readiness for mass disaster situations.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chua, Alvin; Song, Colin; Chai, Andrea; Chan, Lennard; Tan, Kok Chai","journal":"Burns","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e81abc917bdc87684252269d31abde117e28544e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131307.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305417904001196; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305417904001196","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["skin bank set-up","skin allograft transplantation","local skin bank","skin banking programme","ample supply of skin allograft","retrospective review of skin allograft recipients","early excision","management of severe burn patients","complete excision","Burn Centre","conventional staged excision","statistical methods","donation rate","severe burns","significant reduction of mortality rate","victims","logistics","legislation","readiness","pertinent issues","quality assurance","outcome","Singapore","terms of clinical profile","ready source of allografts","mass disaster situations","hospital","coverage","comparison","problems","efficacy","group","allografting","process","establishment","days"],"language":"en"},

Abstract In December 2019, in Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China, there was a report on a group of 27 patients with a pneumonia of unknown origin, linked to exposure in a market with shellfish, fish, and live animals. In January 2020, a new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated in these patients. The disease caused by this virus has been given the name of COVID-19. During the initial stages of the pandemic, and given the scarcity of studies published about this, it was believed that this coronavirus only caused respiratory symptoms. However, as the number of patients increased, it was observed that cardiovascular disease had a fundamental role in the development and prognosis of the infection. The most important risk factors associated with mortality are age and the presence of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular ones. The increase in the levels of troponin, natriuretic peptides, and D-dimer are of prognostic values in patients with an infection due to SARS-CoV-2. Patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, and sudden death, in relation to the systematic response to the virus and to the treatments needed in the acute phase. A review is presented in this article of the cardiovascular involvement due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Triana, Juan Francisco Figueroa; M\u00E1rquez, Diego Alfredo Salas; Silva, Juan Sebasti\u00E1n Cabrera; Castro, Cristian Camilo Alvarado; Sandoval, Andr\u00E9s Felipe Buitrago","journal":"Revista Colombiana de Cardiolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7e67929a356685eb91dad3c68010e0013385e58.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0120563320300760?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rccar.2020.04.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0120563320300760","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["en Wuhan en","en relaci\u00F3n","aumento en","virus y","Hubei en China","papel fundamental en","incremento en niveles","Resumen En diciembre","coronavirus aislada en estos pacientes","los tratamientos necesarios en","Los pacientes","En este documento se revisa","compromiso cardiovascular por SARS-CoV","infecci\u00F3n por SARS-CoV","edad y","cardiovascular disease","tipo cardiovascular","cardiovascular involvement","cardiovascular ones","desarrollo y pron\u00F3stico","p\u00E9ptidos natriur\u00E9ticos y d\u00EDmero-D tiene valor pron\u00F3stico en pacientes","se observ\u00F3 que","se report\u00F3","pacientes aument\u00F3","enfermedad cardiovascular ten\u00EDa","number of patients","arritmias y muerte s\u00FAbita","pescado y animales vivos","Los factores","enfermedad producida por este virus ha sido denominada COVID","pandemia y dados los pocos estudios publicados","se cre\u00EDa que este coronavirus causaba s\u00EDntomas netamente respiratorios","medida que","new strain of coronavirus","infection","se identific\u00F3 una nueva sepa","increased risk of acute myocardial infarction","D-dimer","fundamental role","province of Hubei","acute phase","important risk factors","riesgo m\u00E1s importantes relacionados","respecto","sin embargo","mortalidad son","myocarditis","mariscos","mercado","presencia","insuficiencia cardiaca","choque","troponina","n\u00FAmero","respuesta sist\u00E9mica","heart failure","provincia","infarto agudo","shock","vinculados","exposici\u00F3n","miocarditis","miocardio","comorbilidades","grupo","tienen","etiolog\u00EDa desconocida","etapas iniciales","shellfish","arrhythmias","mortality","natriuretic peptides","neumon\u00EDa","prognostic values","especialmente","fase aguda","sudden death","levels of troponin","presence of comorbidities","relation","exposure","development","prognosis","pneumonia of unknown origin","systematic response","pandemic","live animals","market","Durante","group","enero","article","treatments","initial stages","respiratory symptoms","scarcity of studies","review","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

We performed a systematic review of the literature to summarise the evidence. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid and WEB of Science databases, major organisation websites and reference lists of published studies were searched. The quality of studies was assessed using the STROBE tool (von Elm et al., 1) Individual study data was analyzed using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals as a measure of association between exposure (co-infection), patient outcome and results summarised using forest plots and tables Results Nineteen (19) studies from all over the world were identified and included in the review. Most of the studies 73.7% (14/19) recruited children \u22646 years old. Evidence on the role of co-infection in increasing disease severity was inconclusive. In five out of eight studies, co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to general ward (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3 - 4.4, p = 0.005; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1 - 7.7, P = 0.04; OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 2.0 - 5.1, p = \u003C0.001; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.7-3.4, p = \u003C0.0001 and OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1 - 5.1, p = 0.34), one found it did not (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.4 - 0.9, p = 0.02) and the other 2 had insignificant results. Similarly on risk of admission to ICU, some studies found that co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to ICU (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4 - 5.9, p = 0.004 and OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.7 - 5.6, p = \u003C0.0001), whereas others did not (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05 - 0.75, p = 0.02 and OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2 - 0.6, p = \u003C0.0001). There was no evidence for or against respiratory virus co-infections and risk of bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Conclusion The influence of co-infections on severe viral respiratory disease is still unclear. The observed conflict in outcomes could be because they were conducted in different seasons and covered different years and periods. It could also be due to bias towards the null, especially in studies where only crude analysis was conducted.

Such DAAs target viral proteins and are thus better tolerated but they suffer from emergence of vial resistance. Furthermore, DAAs are often HCV genotype specific. Novel drug candidates targeting host factors required for HCV propagation, so called host-targeting antivirals (HTAs), promise to overcome both caveats. The genetic barrier to resistance is usually considered to be high for HTAs and all HCV genotypes presumably use the same host factors.

However, their elicitation in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. We have hypothesized that HIV-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of the highly conserved epitopes of such antibodies by using \u201Choles\u201D (absence or very weak binding to these epitopes of germline antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an efficient immune response) in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. To begin to test this hypothesis we have designed germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to b12, 2G12 and 2F5 as well as to X5, m44 and m46 which are cross-reactive but with relatively weak neutralizing activity as natively occurring antibodies due to size and/or other effects. The germline-like X5, m44 and m46 bound with relatively high affinity to all tested Envs. In contrast, germline-like b12, 2G12 and 2F5 lacked measurable binding to Envs in an ELISA assay although the corresponding mature antibodies did. These results provide initial evidence that Env structures containing conserved vulnerable epitopes may not initiate humoral responses by binding to germline antibodies. Even if such responses are initiated by very weak binding undetectable in our assay it is likely that they will be outcompeted by responses to structures containing the epitopes of X5, m44, m46, and other antibodies that bind germline BCRs with much higher affinity/avidity. This hypothesis, if further supported by data, could contribute to our understanding of how HIV-1 evades immune responses and offer new concepts for design of effective vaccine immunogens.","publish_time":"2009-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Xiaodong; Chen, Weizao; Feng, Yang; Zhu, Zhongyu; Prabakaran, Ponraj; Wang, Yanping; Zhang, Mei-Yun; Longo, Nancy S.; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7cf3b88c42da6e87294d50416e8c5987d68db94d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ee714e9529ef2965c4a5b980d6b9482ea494b1ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2787893.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.09.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X09018178; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X09018178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19748484/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2787893?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epitopes of germline antibodies","germline BCRs","human monoclonal antibodies","corresponding mature antibodies","epitopes of X5","conserved epitopes","b12","2G12","immune responses","m46","m44","weak binding undetectable","measurable binding","humoral responses","broad HIV","human germline B cell receptor","conserved vulnerable epitopes","weak neutralizing activity","Env structures","2F5 exhibit","hypothesis","ELISA assay","design of effective vaccine immunogens","high affinity","higher affinity","tested Envs","efficient immune response","new concepts","initial evidence","hmAbs","repertoire","results","avidity","envelope glycoprotein","immunogenicity","absence","holes","data","understanding","strategy","elicitation","size","contrast","effects"],"language":"en"},

Porcine bocavirus (PBoV), a newly identified porcine parvovirus, has received attention because it shows clinically high co-infection prevalence with other pathogens in post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PWMS) and diarrheic piglets. In this study, we screened the structural and non-structural proteins encoded by PBoV and found that the non-structural protein NP1 significantly suppressed IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) activity and subsequent IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. However, NP1 affected neither the activation and translocation of STAT1/STAT2, nor the formation of the heterotrimeric transcription factor complex ISGF3 (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9). Detailed analysis demonstrated that PBoV NP1 blocked the ISGF3 DNA-binding activity by combining with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of IRF9. In summary, these results indicate that PBoV NP1 interferes with type I IFN signaling pathway by blocking DNA binding of ISGF3 to attenuate innate immune responses.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ruoxi; Fang, Liurong; Wang, Dang; Cai, Kaimei; Zhang, Huan; Xie, Lilan; Li, Yi; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4f9207d49147ef1be839aa08adbfec11b7e46d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111627.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215003517; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215003517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26342467/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PBoV NP1","DNA binding of ISGF3","ISGF3 DNA-binding activity","DNA-binding domain","non-structural protein NP1","subsequent IFN-stimulated gene","STAT2","pathway","IRF9","suppressed IFN-stimulated response element","innate immune responses","host antiviral immune responses","translocation of STAT1","non-structural proteins","porcine parvovirus","Porcine bocavirus","heterotrimeric transcription factor complex ISGF3","pathogens","syndrome","viruses","ISRE","PWMS","post-weaning multisystemic","formation","evolved countermeasures","high co-infection prevalence","attention","activation","DBD","type","diarrheic piglets","expression","results","Detailed analysis","summary","study"],"language":"en"},

Avian influenza outbreaks in downwind areas of Asian dust storms (ADS) suggest that viruses might be transported by dust storms. OBJECTIVES: We developed a technique to measure ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses. We then used this technique to measure concentrations of these viruses on ADS days and background days, and to assess the relationships between ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses, and air pollutants. METHODS: A high-volume air sampler was used in parallel with a filter cassette to evaluate spiked samples and unspiked samples. Then, air samples were monitored during ADS seasons using a filter cassette coupled with a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. Air samples were monitored during ADS season (1 January to 31 May 2006). RESULTS: We successfully quantified ambient influenza virus using the filtration/real-time qPCR method during ADS days and background days. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the concentration of influenza virus in ambient air. In both the spiked and unspiked samples, the concentration of influenza virus sampled using the filter cassette was higher than that using the high-volume sampler. The concentration of ambient influenza A virus was significantly higher during the ADS days than during the background days. CONCLUSIONS: Our data imply the possibility of long-range transport of influenza virus.","publish_time":"2010-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Pei-Shih; Tsai, Feng Ta; Lin, Chien Kun; Yang, Chun-Yuh; Chan, Chang-Chuan; Young, Chea-Yuan; Lee, Chien-Hung","journal":"Environ Health Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ce2f11a7c4da992b9a8686bd3b2ed53064a2ac8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2944079.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.0901782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20435545/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ambient influenza virus","avian influenza viruses","concentration of influenza virus","concentration of ambient influenza","spread of influenza","ADS days","Avian influenza outbreaks","pathogenic avian influenza","background days","ambient air","air samples","possibility of long-range transport of influenza virus","ADS seasons","unspiked samples","filter cassette","air pollutants","high-volume air sampler","high-volume sampler","technique","real-time qPCR method","downwind areas of Asian dust storms","real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction","filtration","H5N1","significant threat","relationships","data","assay","report","concentrations","human health","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","knowledge","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Wildlife trade can facilitate zoonotic disease transmission and represents a threat to human health and economies in Asia, highlighted by the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak, where a Chinese wildlife market facilitated pathogen transmission. Additionally, wildlife trade poses a serious threat to biodiversity. Therefore, the combined impacts of Asian wildlife trade, sometimes termed bush meat trade, on public health and biodiversity need assessing. From 2010 to 2013, observational data were collected in Lao PDR from markets selling wildlife, including information on volume, form, species and price of wildlife; market biosafety and visitor origin. The potential for traded wildlife to host zoonotic diseases that pose a serious threat to human health was then evaluated at seven markets identified as having high volumes of trade. At the seven markets, during 21 observational surveys, 1,937 alive or fresh dead mammals (approximately 1,009 kg) were observed for sale, including mammals from 12 taxonomic families previously documented to be capable of hosting 36 zoonotic pathogens. In these seven markets, the combination of high wildlife volumes, high risk taxa for zoonoses and poor biosafety increases the potential for pathogen presence and transmission. To examine the potential conservation impact of trade in markets, we assessed the status of 33,752 animals observed during 375 visits to 93 markets, under the Lao PDR Wildlife and Aquatic Law. We observed 6,452 animals listed by Lao PDR as near extinct or threatened with extinction. The combined risks of wildlife trade in Lao PDR to human health and biodiversity highlight the need for a multi-sector approach to effectively protect public health, economic interests and biodiversity.","publish_time":"2016-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greatorex, Zoe F.; Olson, Sarah H.; Singhalath, Sinpakone; Silithammavong, Soubanh; Khammavong, Kongsy; Fine, Amanda E.; Weisman, Wendy; Douangngeun, Bounlom; Theppangna, Watthana; Keatts, Lucy; Gilbert, Martin; Karesh, William B.; Hansel, Troy; Zimicki, Susan; O\u2019Rourke, Kathleen; Joly, Damien O.; Mazet, Jonna A.

While exposure is conditioned by the type of animal and the location in which interactions occur, these in turn are influenced by human activity. The activities people engage in are determined by social as well as contextual factors including gender, age, socio-economic status, occupation, social norms, settlement patterns and livelihood systems, family and community dynamics, as well as national and global influences. This paper proposes an expanded \u201COne Health\u201D conceptual model for human-animal exposure that accounts for social as well as epidemiologic factors. The expanded model informed a new study approach to document the extent of human exposure to animals and explore the interplay of social and environmental factors that influence risk of transmission at the individual and community level. The approach includes a formative phase using qualitative and participatory methods, and a representative, random sample survey to quantify exposure to animals in a variety of settings. The paper discusses the different factors that were considered in developing the approach, including the range of animals asked about and the parameters of exposure that are included, as well as factors to be considered in local adaptation of the generic instruments. Illustrative results from research using this approach in Lao PDR are presented to demonstrate the effect of social factors on how people interact with animals. We believe that the expanded model can be similarly operationalized to explore the interactions of other social and policy-level determinants that may influence transmission of zoonoses.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woldehanna, Sara; Zimicki, Susan","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92b444a77fbb4359ce225fc6e57098bd980d4584.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115783.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464873/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953614007199; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614007199; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.10.059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of social factors","ecologic factors","environmental factors","contextual factors","different factors","epidemiologic factors","social norms","interplay of social","range of animals","human-animal exposure","extent of human exposure","expanded model","parameters of exposure","transmission of zoonoses","risk of transmission","new study approach","conceptual model","community level","human activity","interactions","activities people","paper","community dynamics","type of animal","policy-level determinants","livelihood systems","occupation","settlement patterns","socio-economic status","family","age","document","participatory methods","representative","research","formative phase","gender","random sample survey","Health","opportunities","biological process","local adaptation","individual","Abstract Zoonotic disease emergence","humans","Lao PDR","generic instruments","Illustrative results","location","turn","variety of settings","global influences"],"language":"en"},

The latter represent an assortment of fairly unrelated sequences essentially characterised by a high content of basic amino acids and a length of 10\u201330 residues. CPPs are capable of mediating the cellular uptake of hydrophilic macromolecules like peptides and nucleic acids (e.g. siRNAs, aptamers and antisense-oligonucleotides), which are internalised by cells at a very low rate when applied alone. Up to now, numerous sequences have been reported to show cell-penetrating properties and many of them have been used to successfully transport a variety of different cargos into mammalian cells. In recent years, it has become apparent that endocytosis is a major route of internalisation even though the mechanisms underlying the cellular translocation of CPPs are poorly understood and still subject to controversial discussions. In this review, we will summarise the latest developments in peptide-based cellular delivery of nucleic acid cargos. We will discuss different mechanisms of entry, the intracellular fate of the cargo, correlation studies of uptake versus biological activity of the cargo as well as technical problems and pitfalls.","publish_time":"2008-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Veldhoen, Sandra; Laufer, Sandra D.; Restle, Tobias","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/910a5b6256028ed6f3d360a28f14f49488b56db4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2635728.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms9071276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19325804/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleic acids","viral vectors","cellular delivery of nucleic acid cargos","cellular translocation of CPPs","non-viral nucleic acid delivery systems","cell-penetrating peptides","viral counterpart","recent years","cellular uptake of hydrophilic macromolecules","different mechanisms of entry","variety of different cargos","cell-penetrating properties","cationic polymers","cationic liposomes","synthetic vectors","mammalian cells","unrelated sequences","numerous sequences","correlation studies of uptake","high content of basic amino acids","branched dendrimers","intracellular fate","siRNAs","superior safety profile","biological activity","aptamers","fact","major route of internalisation","endocytosis","length","latest developments","antisense-oligonucleotides","technical problems","controversial discussions","pitfalls","low rate","assortment","residues","review"],"language":"en"},

These patients presented symptoms of acute infection of the lower respiratory tract: high fever, scanty productive cough with or without sputum, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, and other atypical symptoms. Chest radiography showed focal inflammatory condensation in the affected lung and bilateral alveolo-interstitial infiltrate. Laboratory tests showed increased values of leukocytes and C-reactive protein, deficiency of IgG and low lymphocyte CD4\u002B.

We review studies that have exploited internet use and search trends to monitor two such diseases: influenza and dengue. Internet-based surveillance systems have good congruence with traditional surveillance approaches. Additionally, internet-based approaches are logistically and economically appealing.

Design A computable general equilibrium model of the UK economy was specified for various combinations of mortality and morbidity from pandemic influenza, vaccine efficacy, school closures, and prophylactic absenteeism using published data. Setting The 2004 UK economy (the most up to date available with suitable economic data). Main outcome measures The economic impact of various scenarios with different pandemic severity, vaccination, school closure, and prophylactic absenteeism specified in terms of gross domestic product, output from different economic sectors, and equivalent variation. Results The costs related to illness alone ranged between 0.5% and 1.0% of gross domestic product (\u00A38.4bn to \u00A316.8bn) for low fatality scenarios, 3.3% and 4.3% (\u00A355.5bn to \u00A372.3bn) for high fatality scenarios, and larger still for an extreme pandemic. School closure increases the economic impact, particularly for mild pandemics. If widespread behavioural change takes place and there is large scale prophylactic absence from work, the economic impact would be notably increased with few health benefits. Vaccination with a pre-pandemic vaccine could save 0.13% to 2.3% of gross domestic product (\u00A32.2bn to \u00A338.6bn); a single dose of a matched vaccine could save 0.3% to 4.3% (\u00A35.0bn to \u00A372.3bn); and two doses of a matched vaccine could limit the overall economic impact to about 1% of gross domestic product for all disease scenarios. Conclusion Balancing school closure against \u201Cbusiness as usual\u201D and obtaining sufficient stocks of effective vaccine are more important factors in determining the economic impact of an influenza pandemic than is the disease itself. Prophylactic absence from work in response to fear of infection can add considerably to the economic impact.","publish_time":"2009-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Richard D; Keogh-Brown, Marcus R; Barnett, Tony; Tait, Joyce","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61d619975b1d560811f05b5aad82fbeed380f2d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2779854.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19926697/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b4571","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bn","overall economic impact","economic impact of various scenarios","potential economic impact of pandemic influenza","influenza pandemic","different economic sectors","pre-pandemic vaccine","suitable economic data","school closures","extreme pandemic","matched vaccine","terms of gross domestic product","different pandemic severity","prophylactic absenteeism","vaccination","vaccine efficacy","disease scenarios","Conclusion Balancing school closure","high fatality scenarios","low fatality scenarios","work","large scale prophylactic absence","sufficient stocks of effective vaccine","UK economy","behavioural responses","published data","various combinations of mortality","widespread behavioural change","morbidity","output","place","business","important factors","computable general equilibrium model","date available","fear of infection","equivalent variation","single dose","Main outcome","mild pandemics","Objectives","doses","United Kingdom","costs","illness","health benefits"],"language":"en"},

Wild rodents and ectoparasites were collected from 2014 to 2018 in Nan province, Thailand where scrub typhus is highly endemic. Samples from undifferentiated febrile illness (UFI) patients were obtained from a local hospital. A total of 200 UFI patient samples were obtained and 309 rodents and 420 pools of ectoparasites were collected from rodents (n = 285) and domestic animals (n = 135). The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced with the Illumina. Real-time PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm the next-generation sequencing (NGS) results and to characterize pathogen species. Several pathogens were detected by NGS in all populations studied and the most common pathogens identified included Bartonella spp., Rickettsia spp., Leptospira spp., and Orientia tsutsugamushi. Interestingly, Anaplasma spp. was detected in patient, rodent and tick populations, although they were not previously known to cause human disease from this region. Candidatus Neoehrlichia, Neorickettsia spp., Borrelia spp., and Ehrlichia spp. were detected in rodents and their associated ectoparasites. The same O. tsutsugamushi genotypes were shared among UFI patients, rodents, and chiggers in a single district indicating that the chiggers found on rodents were also likely responsible for transmitting to people. Serological testing using immunofluorescence assays in UFI samples showed high prevalence (IgM/IgG) of Rickettsia and Orientia pathogens, most notably among samples collected during September\u2013November. Additionally, a higher number of seropositive samples belonged to patients in the working age population (20\u201360 years old). The results presented in this study demonstrate that the increased risk of human infection or exposure to chiggers and their associated pathogen (O. tsutsugamushi) resulted in part from two important factors; working age group and seasons for rice cultivation and harvesting. Evidence of pathogen exposure was shown to occur as there was seropositivity (IgG) in UFI patients for bartonellosis as well as for anaplasmosis. Using a metagenomic approach, this study demonstrated the circulation and transmission of several pathogens in the environment, some of which are known causative agents of illness in human populations.","publish_time":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takhampunya, Ratree; Korkusol, Achareeya; Pongpichit, Chalermpol; Yodin, Komsan; Rungrojn, Artharee; Chanarat, Nitima; Promsathaporn, Sommai; Monkanna, Taweesak; Thaloengsok, Sasikanya; Tippayachai, Bousaraporn; Kumfao, Naruemon; Richards, Allen L.; Davidson, Silas A.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5479a0b2eb8bb566074e933d9e398fbb7db09ab1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6399164.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30863381/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["UFI","Illumina","NGS","IgM/IgG"],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["UFI samples","UFI patients","human populations","UFI patient samples","Wild rodents","chiggers","diverse populations","human disease","animal populations","tick populations","Orientia pathogens","study","common pathogens","associated pathogen","associated ectoparasites","Orientia tsutsugamushi","causative agents of illness","causative agents of disease","higher number of seropositive samples","metagenomic approach","Evidence of pathogen exposure","results","NGS","pathogen species","pools of ectoparasites","tsutsugamushi genotypes","increased risk of human infection","working age population","age group","bacterial communities","domestic animals","Sanger sequencing","generation sequencing","undifferentiated febrile illness","immunofluorescence assays","high prevalence","humans","IgM","Thailand","scrub typhus","seasons","included Bartonella","Serological testing","Borrelia","Nan province","rice cultivation","role","microorganisms","transmission","Leptospira","circulation","bartonellosis","important factors","single district","Candidatus Neoehrlichia","Neorickettsia","Real-time PCR","S rRNA gene","vectors","seropositivity","total","years old","people","environment","local hospital","region","anaplasmosis","Anaplasma","Illumina"],"language":"en"},

While ASEAN member countries have already signed the Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers, the health rights of migrants still need to be addressed, especially with ongoing universal health coverage (UHC) reforms in most ASEAN countries. This paper seeks to examine the inclusion of migrants in the UHC systems of five ASEAN countries which exhibit diverse migration profiles and are currently undergoing varying stages of UHC development. DESIGN: A scoping review of current migration trends and policies as well as ongoing UHC developments and migrant inclusion in UHC in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand was conducted. RESULTS: In general, all five countries, whether receiving or sending, have schemes that cover migrants to varying extents. Thailand even allows undocumented migrants to opt into its Compulsory Migrant Health Insurance scheme, while Malaysia and Singapore are still yet to consider including migrants in their government-run UHC systems. In terms of predominantly sending countries, the Philippines\u0027s social health insurance provides outbound migrants with portable insurance yet with limited benefits, while Indonesia still needs to strengthen the implementation of its compulsory migrant insurance which has a health insurance component. Overall, the five ASEAN countries continue to face implementation challenges, and will need to improve on their UHC design in order to ensure genuine inclusion of migrants, including undocumented migrants. However, such reforms will require strong political decisions from agencies outside the health sector that govern migration and labor policies. Furthermore, countries must engage in multilateral and bilateral dialogue as they redefine UHC beyond the basis of citizenship and reimagine UHC systems that transcend national borders. CONCLUSIONS: By enhancing migrant coverage, ASEAN countries can make UHC systems truly \u2018universal\u2019. Migrant inclusion in UHC is a human rights imperative, and it is in ASEAN\u0027s best interest to protect the health of migrants as it pursues the path toward collective social progress and regional economic prosperity.","publish_time":"2015-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guinto, Ramon Lorenzo Luis R.; Curran, Ufara Zuwasti; Suphanchaimat, Rapeepong; Pocock, Nicola S.","journal":"Glob Health Action","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57a3e8ebd6f29c8e8126ff652f6f79b1b8fbffc6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4308585.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626624/; https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v8.25749","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASEAN","Association of South East Asian Nations","UHC","Philippines, Singapore","Compulsory Migrant Health Insurance"],"locations":["Thailand","Malaysia","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["health of migrants","UHC systems","ASEAN countries","UHC design","health rights of migrants","undocumented migrants","migrant inclusion","outbound migrants","ASEAN member countries","ongoing UHC developments","genuine inclusion of migrants","health insurance component","compulsory migrant insurance","Compulsory Migrant Health Insurance scheme","health sector","migrant coverage","Philippines\u0027s social health insurance","varying stages of UHC development","Rights of Migrant Workers","ongoing universal health coverage","portable insurance","Malaysia","Indonesia","reforms","Singapore","Thailand","diverse migration profiles","human rights imperative","regional integration","labor policies","implementation challenges","scoping review of current migration trends","collective social progress","regional economic prosperity","cross-border mobility of workers","gears","Association of South East Asian Nations","agencies","strong political decisions","path","Promotion","limited benefits","Declaration","basis of citizenship","bilateral dialogue","Protection","multilateral","national borders","government","ASEAN\u0027s best","BACKGROUND","schemes","extents","CONCLUSIONS","coming years","RESULTS","paper","terms"],"language":"en"},

Sialic acid-bearing glycan structures are prominently displayed at the cell surface, and, consequently, these structures can function as receptors for a large number of diverse viruses. Structural biology research has helped to establish the molecular bases for many virus\u2013sialic acid interactions. Due to the icosahedral 532 point group symmetry that underlies many viral capsids, the receptor binding sites are frequently arranged in a highly symmetric fashion and linked by five-fold, three-fold, or two-fold rotation axes. For the inhibition of viral attachment, one emerging strategy is based on developing multivalent sialic acid-based inhibitors that can simultaneously engage several of these binding sites, thus binding viral capsids with high avidity. In this review, we will evaluate the structures of non-enveloped virus capsid proteins bound to sialylated glycan receptors and discuss the potential of these structures for the development of potent antiviral attachment inhibitors.","publish_time":"2019-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rustmeier, Nils H.; Strebl, Michael; Stehle, Thilo","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab6ea04273419326cd53f7e41f36e6120a63f18b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6832341.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11100947; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615155/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral capsids","glycan structures","inhibition of viral attachment","viral particle","sialic acid interactions","multivalent sialic acid-based inhibitors","carbohydrate receptors","sialylated glycan receptors","Virus infections","receptor binding sites","structures of non-enveloped virus capsid proteins","fold rotation axes","development of potent antiviral attachment inhibitors","host cell","cell surface","emerging strategy","potential","point group symmetry","molecular bases","large number of diverse viruses","high avidity","Structural biology research","symmetric fashion","review"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1000 mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant. Air and sewage disinfection was proceeded routinely and strictly. Hospital environmental surfaces and PPE of staffs in isolation wards were sampled using swabs. The sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled. The respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected. The respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods were used to confirm the existence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Viral culture was done for the samples positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. RESULTS: During the study period, 33 laboratory-confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital. None of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staffs PPE samples in isolation wards. Though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection pool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection pool was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative.

Discussion Ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 include follicular conjunctivitis and have been repeatedly noted as an initial or subsequent symptom of COVID-19 positive patients. Particularly in patients with ocular manifestations, there is evidence that the virus may present in tears based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab samples via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The virus may therefore be transmittable from the ocular surface to a new host via contact with the ocular mucosa, tears, or subsequent fomites. Conclusions All healthcare professionals should ask patients about ocular symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2, use eye protection such as goggles or face shields as part of the standard personal protective equipment (PPE) for high-risk patients in addition to wearing of masks both by the patient and provider, and should consider tears to be potentially infectious.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dockery, Dominique M.; Rowe, Susannah G.; Murphy, Marjorie A.; Krzystolik, Magdalena G.","journal":"J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d40163aa648a837209bf31d0c3b54b8a38e6969.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S073646792030398X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.04.060; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073646792030398X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","ocular mucosa","ocular surface","ocular transmission","ocular signs","Discussion Ocular manifestations of SARS","ocular symptoms consistent","detection of SARS","tears","high-risk patients","positive patients","novel coronavirus","subsequent symptom of COVID","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Abstract Background Coronavirus disease","respiratory droplets","close contact","subsequent fomites","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","conjunctival swab samples","PPE","standard personal protective equipment","new host","face shields","RT-PCR","eye protection","healthcare professionals","goggles","masks","addition","possibility","case reports","conduit","provider","Conclusions","evidence","follicular conjunctivitis","Research","source of infection"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, the mutations identified in GP2, nsp9 and M of the second experiment pointed to changes in the amino acid charges and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase structure.

However, the exact mechanism by which DDX3 functions in antiviral innate immunity remains to be determined. We found that the expression of the protein activator of the interferon\u2010induced protein kinase (PACT) was regulated by DDX3 in human cells. PACT acts as a cellular activator of retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene\u2010I\u2010like receptors in the sensing of viral RNAs. DDX3 facilitated the translation of PACT mRNA that may contain a structured 5\u2032 UTR. Knockdown of DDX3 decreased the viral RNA detection sensitivity of the cells. PACT partially rescued defects of interferon\u2010\u03B21 and chemokine (C\u2010C motif) ligand 5/RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) induction in DDX3\u2010knockdown HEK293 cells. Therefore, DDX3 may participate in antiviral innate immunity, at least in part, by translational control of PACT. Moreover, we show that overexpression of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein inhibited the translation of a reporter mRNA harboring the PACT 5\u2032 UTR. The HCV core protein was associated and colocalized with DDX3 in cytoplasmic stress granules, suggesting that the HCV core may abrogate the function of DDX3 by sequestering DDX3 in stress granules. The perturbation of DDX3 by viral proteins delineates a critical role for DDX3 in antiviral host defense.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Ming\u2010Chih; Sun, H.

METHODS: Fifty general ICU survivors (ventilated for \u22655 days) performed a maximal cycle ergometer CPET within 6 weeks of hospital discharge. Health-related quality of life was measured by the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 version 2.0 questionnaire. RESULTS: Fifty patients (median age, 57 years; median Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 16) completed a CPET 24 \u00B1 14 days after hospital discharge with no adverse events. Significant exercise limitation was present with peak Vo(2) 56% \u00B1 16% predicted and anaerobic threshold (AT) 41% \u00B1 13% of peak predicted Vo(2). Prospectively stratified subgroup comparison showed that patients ventilated for 14 days or more had a significantly lower AT and peak Vo(2) than those ventilated for 5 to 14 days (AT: 9.6 vs 11.7 mL/kg per minute O(2), P = .009; peak Vo(2): 12.9 vs 15.3 mL/kg per minute O(2), P = .022). At peak exercise, heart rate reserve was 25% \u00B1 14%, breathing reserve was 47% \u00B1 19%, and the respiratory exchange ratio was 0.96 \u00B1 0.11. Ventilatory equivalents for CO(2) (Eqco(2)) were 39 \u00B1 9. CONCLUSIONS: Significant exercise limitation is evident in patients who have had critical illness. Etiology of exercise limitation appears multifactorial, with general deconditioning and muscle weakness as major contributory factors. Early CPET appears a practical method of assessing exercise capacity in ICU survivors. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing could be used to select patients who may benefit most from a targeted physical rehabilitation program, aid in exercise prescription, and help assess the response to intervention.","publish_time":"2011-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benington, Steve; McWilliams, David; Eddleston, Jane; Atkinson, Dougal","journal":"J Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58fbfe5b0bcba03408aa2644b9583d42ecc37ead.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125548.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088394411100373X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21958985/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2011.07.080; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088394411100373X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","CPET","the Medical Outcome Study Short Form","Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II","CO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peak exercise","exercise prescription","exercise capacity","Significant exercise limitation","pathophysiology of exercise limitation","Etiology of exercise limitation","peak Vo","patients","days","peak predicted Vo","feasibility of cardiopulmonary exercise testing","general ICU survivors","Early CPET","general deconditioning","minute O","vs","maximal cycle ergometer CPET","weeks of hospital discharge","median age","general adult intensive care unit","median Acute Physiology","Chronic Health Evaluation","heart rate reserve","early assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness","Health-related quality of life","Medical Outcome Study Short Form","aid","years","muscle weakness","version","practical method","targeted physical rehabilitation program","major contributory factors","help","score","questionnaire","CONCLUSIONS","adverse events","response","stratified subgroup comparison","RESULTS","population","METHODS","critical illness","respiratory exchange ratio","intervention","PURPOSE","aims","anaerobic threshold","Ventilatory equivalents","Eqco"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about healthcare professionals\u0027 fears and attitudes to start CPR and the impact of training. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there were any changes in the attitudes among healthcare professionals to performing CPR from before to after training. METHODS: Healthcare professionals from two Swedish hospitals were asked to answer a questionnaire before and after training. The questions were relating to physical and mental discomfort and attitudes to CPR. Statistical analysis used was generalized McNemar\u0027s test. RESULTS: Overall, there was significant improvement in 10 of 11 items, reflecting various aspects of attitudes to CPR. All groups of health care professionals (physicians, nurses, assistant nurses, and \u0022others\u0022 = physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social welfare officers, psychologists, biomedical analysts) felt more secure in CPR knowledge after education. In other aspects, such as anxiety prior to a possible cardiac arrest, only nurses and assistant nurses improved. The concern about being infected, when performing mouth to mouth ventilation, was reduced with the most marked reduction in physicians (75%; P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this hospital-based setting, we found a positive outcome of education and training in CPR concerning healthcare professionals\u0027 attitudes to perform CPR.

Discovering pathogenic viruses through surveillance is the key to preparedness for this potential threat. Next generation sequencing (NGS) helps us to identify viruses without the design of a specific PCR primer. The major task in NGS data analysis is taxonomic identification for vast numbers of sequences. However, taxonomic identification via a BLAST search against all the known sequences is a computational bottleneck. DESCRIPTION: Here we propose an enhanced lowest-common-ancestor based method (ELM) to effectively identify viruses from massive sequence data. To reduce the computational cost, ELM uses a customized database composed only of viral sequences for the BLAST search. At the same time, ELM adopts a novel criterion to suppress the rise in false positive assignments caused by the small database. As a result, identification by ELM is more than 1,000 times faster than the conventional methods without loss of accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that ELM will contribute to direct diagnosis of viral infections.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In silico bioinformatic experiments were used to select an optimum annotation strategy for discovering human viruses in virome datasets, and applied to annotate a class B biosolids virome. Results from the in silico study indicated that less than 1% errors in virus identification could be achieved when nucleotide-based search programs (BLASTn or tBLASTx), viral genome only databases, and sequence reads greater than 200 nt were considered. Within the 51,925 annotated sequences, 94 DNA and 19 RNA sequences were identified as human viruses. Virus diversity included environmentally transmitted agents such as parechovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and aichi virus, as well as viruses associated with chronic human infections such as human herpes and hepatitis C viruses. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a bioinformatic approach for identifying pathogens in a virome dataset, and demonstrated the human virus diversity in a relevant environmental sample.

Italy was early and severely involved, with a critical spread of the infection and a very high number of victims. Person-to-person spread mainly occurs via respiratory droplets and contact. The median incubation period is 5 days. The spectrum of respiratory symptoms may range from mild to severe, strictly depending on the age of the patient and the underlying comorbidities. In children COVID-19 related disease is less frequent and less aggressive. In Italy 1% of positive cases are under 18 years of age, and no deaths have been recorded before 29 years of age. For patients affected by rheumatic disease, despite the concerns related to the imbalance of their immune response and the effect of immunosuppressive treatments, there are still few data to understand the real consequences of this infection. Major scientific societies have issued recommendations to help rheumatologists in caring their patients. Interestingly, some of the drugs mostly used by rheumatologists appear to be promising in critical COVID-19 infected patients, where the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm seem to drive to the multiorgan failure.

Due to its unique, universal conservation in all RNA viruses, the palm subdomain of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) is widely used for evolutionary and taxonomic inferences. We report here the results of elaborated computer-assisted analysis of newly sequenced replicases from Thosea asigna virus (TaV) and the closely related Euprosterna elaeasa virus (EeV), insect-specific ssRNA\u002B viruses, which revise a capsid-based classification of these viruses with tetraviruses, an Alphavirus-like family. The replicases of TaV and EeV do not have characteristic methyltransferase and helicase domains, and include a putative RdRp with a unique C\u2013A\u2013B motif arrangement in the palm subdomain that is also found in two dsRNA birnaviruses. This circular motif rearrangement is a result of migration of \u223C22 amino acid (aa) residues encompassing motif C between two internal positions, separated by \u223C110aa, in a conserved region of \u223C550aa. Protein modeling shows that the canonical palm subdomain architecture of poliovirus (ssRNA\u002B) RdRp could accommodate the identified sequence permutation through changes in backbone connectivity of the major structural elements in three loop regions underlying the active site. This permutation transforms the ferredoxin-like \u03B21\u03B1A\u03B22\u03B23\u03B1B\u03B24 fold of the palm subdomain into the \u03B22\u03B23\u03B21\u03B1A\u03B1B\u03B24 structure and brings \u03B2-strands carrying two principal catalytic Asp residues into sequential proximity such that unique structural properties and, ultimately, unique functionality of the permuted RdRps may result. The permuted enzymes show unprecedented interclass sequence conservation between RdRps of true ssRNA\u002B and dsRNA viruses and form a minor, deeply separated cluster in the RdRp tree, implying that other, as yet unidentified, viruses may employ this type of RdRp. The structural diversification of the palm subdomain might be a major event in the evolution of template-dependent polynucleotide polymerases in the RNA\u2013protein world.","publish_time":"2002-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Pringle, Fiona M; Zeddam, Jean-Louis; Luke, Brian T; Cameron, Craig E; Kalmakoff, James; Hanzlik, Terry N; Gordon, Karl H.J; Ward, Vernon K","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/430e170a0e1d7b50278f2626184d00ed87edd2d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127740.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283602010331; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283602010331","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["palm subdomain of RNA","ubiquitous \u03B1\u03B2 palm subdomain","unique C","dsRNA viruses","dependent RNA polymerases","canonical palm subdomain architecture of poliovirus","motif C","unique structural properties","sequence conservation","unique functionality","permuted RdRps","putative RdRp","RdRp tree","type of RdRp","dependent polynucleotide polymerases","RdRps of true ssRNA","C sequence motifs crucial","EeV","B motif arrangement","major structural elements","identified sequence permutation","replicases of TaV","permuted enzymes","structural diversification","Abstract Template-dependent polynucleotide synthesis","insect-specific ssRNA","circular motif rearrangement","major event","evolution of template","universal conservation","sequenced replicases","Protein modeling","result of migration","protein world","separated cluster","dsRNA birnaviruses","Thosea asigna virus","principal catalytic Asp residues","related Euprosterna elaeasa virus","sequential proximity","backbone connectivity","\u03B2-strands","analysis","loop regions","changes","core component","tetraviruses","amino acid","\u03B22\u03B23\u03B21\u03B1A\u03B1B\u03B24 structure","helicase domains","characteristic methyltransferase","\u03B21\u03B1A\u03B22\u03B23\u03B1B\u03B24 fold","capsid-based classification","catalysis","minor","internal positions","results of elaborated computer","active site","ferredoxin","Alphavirus","conserved region","taxonomic inferences","family"],"language":"en"},

In contrast to the existing literature, that relies heavily on qualitative accounts of the epidemic and ethnography, this study tests the dynamics of the connections between critical actors with quantitative network analysis. This novel approach explores how individuals are embedded in social relationships and how this may affect the production and use of evidence. The meso-level analysis, conducted between March and June 2019, is based on the traces of individuals\u0027 engagement found in secondary sources. Source material includes policy and strategy documents, committee papers, meeting minutes and personal correspondence. Social network analysis software, UCINet, was used to analyse the data and Netdraw for the visualisation of the network. Far from being one cohesive community of experts and government officials, the network of 134 people was weakly held together by a handful of super-connectors. Social scientists\u2019 poor connections to the government embedded biomedical community may explain why they were most successful when they framed their expertise in terms of widely accepted concepts. The whole network was geographically and racially almost entirely isolated from those affected by or directly responding to the crisis in West Africa. Nonetheless, the case was made for interdisciplinarity and the value of social science in emergency preparedness and response. The challenge now is moving from the rhetoric to action on complex infectious disease outbreaks in ways that value all perspectives equally.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Georgalakis, James","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e75eca2d1b8149aa2e8e18f1a0286a96485434fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115759.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32143087/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953620300708; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.112851; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620300708","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Sierra Leone","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["Social network analysis software","quantitative network analysis","UK policy network","social relationships","value of social science","inclusion of social scientists","Social scientists\u2019 poor connections","meso-level analysis","government officials","biomedical community","Ebola crisis","cohesive community of experts","use of interdisciplinary research","strategy documents","committee papers","meeting minutes","complex infectious disease outbreaks","critical actors","ethnography","rhetoric","ways","action","dynamics","emergency preparedness","personal correspondence","expertise","epidemic","study","Source material","response","interdisciplinarity","UCINet","traces of individuals\u0027 engagement","secondary sources","qualitative accounts","transformational moment","terms","accepted concepts","Sierra Leone","Netdraw","visualisation","existing literature","handful of super-connectors","contrast","novel approach","data","perspectives","West Africa","people","production","evidence","case","challenge"],"language":"en"},

In this study, pig foetuses at different stages of gestation were injected in utero with (a) partially UV-inactivated wild TGEV or (b) fully UV-inactivated wild or dm49-4 mutant TGEV Coronavirus. Nucleated cells from foetal liver, bone marrow, spleen and blood were isolated 10 or 20 h after injection and assayed ex vivo for IFN\u03B1 secretion by ELISPOT and ELISA techniques. The administration of TGEV induced IFN\u03B1-secreting cells in foetal lymphohaematopoietic organs at mid-gestation. In contrast, IFN\u03B1 was not detected in control sham-operated foetuses. A specific point mutation in the amino acid sequence of the viral membrane glycoprotein M of TGEV mutant dm49-4 was associated with lower or absent IFN\u03B1 in utero inducibility by mutant virus as compared with wild virus. Row cytometry analysis did not show differences in leukocyte surface marker expression between control and TGEV- or between dm49-4 and wild virus-treated foetus cells, with the exception of a reduction in percentages of polymorphonuclear cells in TGEV-treated lymphohaematopoietic tissues, which is probably due to IFN\u03B1 secretion. The present data provided in vivo evidence of IFN\u03B1 secretion at the cell level in foetal lymphohaematopoietic organs.

The virus may contaminate live canine vaccines based on cultured feline cells. The in vivo infectivity, acute and subacute pathogenicity, and viral proliferation of the RD114 virus were evaluated by experimental infection of dogs. METHODS: Nine specific pathogen free dogs were divided into three groups, with each group consisting of one female and two male dogs. Dogs were subcutaneously inoculated in the neck with either 1 ml RD114 stock virus (group A), inactivated RD114 virus suspension (group B), or cell culture medium (group C) as a negative control. To assess blood cell counts and biochemical properties, blood samples from each group were collected 5 days before inoculation, just prior to inoculation, and 1, 3, 7 and 10 days post-inoculation. RESULT: During the experimental period of 51 days, none of the dogs inoculated with RD114 virus showed any clinical signs, significant increases in rectal temperature or abnormal blood biochemical characteristics including C-reactive protein when compared with the negative controls. We were not able to re-isolate the RD114 virus from buffy coat cells of group A dogs. Additionally, we could not detect RD114 provirus in the genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph node, spleen and sternal bone marrow cells. CONCLUSIONS: Signs of RD114 virus proliferation were not found after subcutaneous infection of dogs. Although the potential risk caused by infection with RD114 virus in dogs could not be assessed in this study, we suspect that RD114 virus has little or no virulence in dogs.","publish_time":"2011-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Narushima, Rie; Horiuchi, Noriyuki; Usui, Tatsufumi; Ogawa, Takashi; Takahashi, Toshio; Shimazaki, Tomoaki","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c6a45d1e56660fa713b637825b96e287a0acef5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3038973.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21269522/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-53-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RD114 stock virus","Signs of RD114 virus proliferation","RD114 provirus","inactivated RD114 virus suspension","male dogs","experimental infection of dogs","subcutaneous infection of dogs","group C","group B","feline endogenous retrovirus RD114","blood cell","specific pathogen free dogs","buffy coat cells of group","blood samples","days post-inoculation","abnormal blood biochemical characteristics","peripheral blood leukocytes","cultured feline cells","biochemical properties","clinical signs","viral proliferation","sternal bone marrow cells","experimental period","negative controls","C-reactive protein","cell culture medium","rectal temperature","spleen","lymph node","significant increases","genomic DNA","live canine vaccines","subacute pathogenicity","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","potential risk","infectivity","female","groups","neck","virulence","RESULT","genome of cats","study"],"language":"en"},

Although vaccines provide the most effective means for preventing infectious diseases, there are two main reasons why it is often difficult to reach a socially optimal level of vaccine coverage: (i) the emergence of operational issues (such as yield uncertainty) on the supply side, and (ii) the existence of negative network effects on the consumption side. In particular, uncertainties about production yield and vaccine imperfections often make manufacturing some vaccines a risky process and may lead the manufacturer to produce below the socially optimal level. At the same time, negative network effects provide incentives to potential consumers to free ride off the immunity of the vaccinated population. In this research, we consider how a central policy-maker can induce a socially optimal vaccine coverage through the use of incentives to both consumers and the vaccine manufacturer. We consider a monopoly market for an imperfect vaccine; we show that a fixed two-part subsidy is unable to coordinate the market, but derive a two-part menu of subsidies that leads to a socially efficient level of coverage.","publish_time":"2013-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adida, Elodie; Dey, Debabrata; Mamani, Hamed","journal":"Eur J Oper Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/483dd65eb6b06ffb4f69b0da8e3a1f9ea1a92fb0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/32a76c6098177841292dd6c2fe22aaee715e97ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126193.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377221713004335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288068/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221713004335; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2013.05.034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimal vaccine coverage","vaccine manufacturer","optimal level of vaccine coverage","vaccine imperfections","imperfect vaccine","efficient level of coverage","vaccines","existence of negative network effects","prevention of infectious diseases","potential consumers","use of incentives","production yield","monopoly market","fixed two-part subsidy","two-part menu of subsidies","manufacturing","public health","free ride","immunity","uncertainties","risky process","effective means","time","main reasons","uncertainty","important concerns","emergence of operational issues","central policy-maker","consumption","vaccinated population","supply","research"],"language":"en"},

Nowadays, IFNs (specifically type I IFNs), have been ascribed as the cytokines that bridge the innate and adaptive immunity soon after the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by the infected host. Notably, a unifying mechanism for type I IFN production has been established upon innate immune detection. Thus, TLR 3, 4, 7 and 9 associate endosomal recognition of PAMPs to type I IFN responses, a mechanism that has been shown in plasmacytoid dendritic cells to be dependent on the PI3K/mTOR/S6K pathway. It is worth noting that pathogen recognition triggers a fine-tuned controlled program that not only includes the production of antiviral (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines to initiate the antiviral response but also signals the cessation of the response through the induction of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS). SOCS in turn is under tight regulation of the TAM receptors (protein tyrosine kinase receptors TYRO3, AXL and MER), and activation of which thereby protects the host from the threats of autoimmune diseases.","publish_time":"2009-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonjardim, Cl\u00E1udio A.; Ferreira, Paulo C.P.; Kroon, Erna G.","journal":"Immunology Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15edc032af91b8816dba3ea640dcb5a92b74f7c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112942.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19059436/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247808002484; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247808002484; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2008.11.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TAM","AXL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFNs","type","recognition of pathogen","pathogen recognition","IFN production","production of antiviral","antiviral response","IFN responses","antiviral agents","SOCS","associate endosomal recognition of PAMPs","TAM receptors","unifying mechanism","infected host","pro-inflammatory cytokines","innate immune detection","protein tyrosine kinase receptors TYRO3","AXL","tight regulation","PI3K","MER","molecular patterns","fine-tuned controlled program","mTOR","induction of suppressors","years","cessation","adaptive immunity","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","S6K pathway","threats of autoimmune diseases","turn","activation","enormous progress","Abstract Interferons","TLR"],"language":"en"},

U.S. Federal health agencies are leveraging these platforms to \u2018engage\u2019 social media users to read, spread, promote and encourage health related discussions. However, different agencies and their communications get varying levels of engagement. In this study we use statistical models to identify factors that associate with engagement. METHODS: We analyze over 45,000 Facebook posts from 72 Facebook accounts belonging to 24 health agencies. Account usage, user activity, sentiment and content of these posts are studied. We use the hurdle regression model to identify factors associated with the level of engagement and Cox proportional hazards model to identify factors associated with duration of engagement. RESULTS: In our analysis we find that agencies and accounts vary widely in their usage of social media and activity they generate. Statistical analysis shows, for instance, that Facebook posts with more visual cues such as photos or videos or those which express positive sentiment generate more engagement. We further find that posts on certain topics such as occupation or organizations negatively affect the duration of engagement.

The objective of this study was to determine if CDP capacity (i.e., skills and resources) and involvement in CDP programming improved in public health organizations in Canada from 2004 to 2010. Data for this repeated cross-sectional study were drawn from two waves of a national census of organizations mandated to carry out primary prevention of chronic disease and/or promotion of healthy eating, physical activity and tobacco control. Medians for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables were compared across time. Neither resources nor level of priority for CDP increased over time. There was little difference in the proportion of organizations with high levels of skills and involvement in core CDP practices (i.e., needs assessment, identification of relevant practices, planning, evaluation). Skills and involvement in CDP risk factor programming showed some gains, some steady states and some losses. Specifically, skill and involvement in tobacco control programming declined markedly while the proportion of organizations involved in healthy eating and physical activity programming increased. Skills to address and involvement in programming related to social determinants of health remained low over time as did involvement in programming addressing multiple risk factors concurrently. The lack of marked improvement in CDP capacity between 2004 and 2010 against a backdrop of initiatives favourable to strengthening the preventive health system in Canada suggests that efforts may have fallen short.","publish_time":"2014-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanusaik, N.; Contandriopoulos, D.; Kishchuk, N.; Maximova, K.; Paradis, G.; O\u0027Loughlin, J.L.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5599ef44b976e30bf33b8cae917fc478b5db1b83.json; document_parses/pdf_json/96ad27a7f65fcceadf5c12578849c6d280e97c89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111625.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25132388/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2014.05.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350614001280; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350614001280","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDP"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["CDP programming","involvement","CDP capacity","CDP risk factor programming","public health organizations","physical activity programming","core CDP practices","tobacco control programming","proportion of organizations","Canada","time","public health infrastructure","social determinants of health","preventive health system","high levels of skills","national census of organizations","resources","primary prevention of chronic disease","promotion of healthy eating","numerous new chronic disease prevention","continuous variables","categorical variables","identification of relevant practices","multiple risk factors","backdrop of initiatives favourable","repeated cross-sectional study","gains","collective impact of major shifts","frequencies","waves","assessment","planning","efforts","lack of marked improvement","steady states","level of priority","Data","evaluation","Medians","decade","place","little difference","losses","objective"],"language":"en"},

Clinical presentation is characterized with acute diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration in pigs of all ages, with a possible high mortality in suckling piglets. The disease emerged in the USA in 2013 causing heavy losses, and re-emerged in Europe in 2014, but with milder consequences. RESULTS: In the spring 2016, PED-like symptoms were reported to be seen on an agricultural holding in Eastern Croatia; laboratory workup confirmed the Croatia\u2019s first PED outbreak ever. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) strain responsible for the outbreak was of the S-INDEL genotype, much the same as other European PEDV strains. In 2017, a post-outbreak serology was carried out in three counties in Eastern Croatia, revealing seropositivity in pigs bred on four large industrial holdings (9.09%). The seroprevalence across PEDV-positive holdings was up to 82.8%. The latter holdings were unanimously managed by an enterprise that had never reported PED before. CONCLUSIONS: PED has emerged in Croatian pig population causing potentially considerable losses. The circulating strain was of the S-INDEL genotype. Serological workup proved PEDV spread to another four agricultural holdings, demonstrating the importance of not only external, but also internal biosecurity measures.","publish_time":"2019-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brni\u0107, Dragan; \u0160imi\u0107, Ivana; Lojki\u0107, Ivana; Kre\u0161i\u0107, Nina; Jungi\u0107, Andreja; Bali\u0107, Davor; Loli\u0107, Marica; Kne\u017Eevi\u0107, Dra\u017Een; Hengl, Brigita","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0cbbb6421bb2fb309021936921aaadadfe74844.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6637520.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319854/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2002-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["Europe","Eastern Croatia","Croatia"],"keyphrases":["PED outbreak","PEDV-positive holdings","agricultural holdings","Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","Eastern Croatia","acute diarrhoea","pigs","European PEDV strains","large industrial holdings","S-INDEL genotype","post-outbreak serology","re-emergent viral pig disease","laboratory workup","considerable losses","Serological workup","heavy losses","global importance","circulating strain","Croatian pig population","Alphacoronavirus genus","possible high mortality","ages","seropositivity","Croatia\u2019s","Coronaviridae family","suckling piglets","counties","dehydration","BACKGROUND","internal biosecurity measures","Clinical presentation","USA","spring","seroprevalence","symptoms","CONCLUSIONS","enterprise","milder consequences","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The change in airborne endotoxin concentration during UV inactivation was analyzed, and UVC and UVA irradiation showed no marked effect on endotoxin degradation.

Methods A cross-sectional point prevalence survey, was developed and disseminated through the pediatric emergency medicine research networks for Europe (REPEM) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI). We aimed to include ten EDs for countries with \u003E 20 million inhabitants and five EDs for less populated countries, unless the number of eligible EDs was below five. ED directors or their delegates completed the survey between March 20th and 21st to report practice at that time. We used descriptive statistics to analyse data. Results Overall 102 centers from 18 countries (86% response rate) completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events. Wide variation on PPE items was shown for recommended PPE use at pre-triage and for patient assessment, with 62% of centers experiencing shortage in one or more PPE items, most frequently FFP2/N95 masks. Only 17% of EDs had negative pressure isolation rooms. COVID-19 positive ED staff was reported in 25% of centers. Conclusion We found variation and identified gaps in preparedness and response to the COVID-19 epidemic across European referral EDs for children. A lack in early availability of a documented contingency plan, provision of simulation training, appropriate use of PPE, and appropriate isolation facilities emerged as gaps that should be optimized to improve preparedness and inform responses to future pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bressan, Silvia; Buonsenso, Danilo; Farrugia, Ruth; Parri, Niccolo\u2019; Oostenbrink, Rianne; Titomanlio, Luigi; Roland, Damian; Nijman, Ruud G.; Maconochie, Ian; Da Dalt, Liviana; Mintegi, Santiago","journal":"Ann. emerg. med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69bf0bc626913320be45f8af0bd8714c71e5fa18.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064420303668; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064420303668?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.05.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419713/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["PPE","ED"],"locations":["Europe","United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["European EDs","PPE items","COVID","preparedness","European referral EDs","gaps","centers","appropriate use of PPE","number of eligible EDs","recommended PPE use","populated countries","children","response rate","ED directors","documented contingency plan","appropriate isolation facilities","positive ED staff","cross-sectional point prevalence survey","future pandemics","Wide variation","negative pressure isolation rooms","provision of simulation training","REPEM","pre-triage","epidemic","pediatric emergency medicine research networks","early availability","United Kingdom","patient assessment","Methods","FFP2","Ireland","PERUKI","lack","responses","delegates","variability","inhabitants","shortage","N95 masks","Abstract Study objective","descriptive statistics","data","Conclusion","Results","practice","time","simulations","events"],"language":"en"},

Although a number of G and P genotypes have been identified in porcine GARs, few attempts have been made to study the molecular epidemiology of these viruses associated with diarrhea outbreaks within a farm over an extended period of time. Here, we investigated the molecular characteristics of GARs that caused four outbreaks of diarrhea among suckling pigs in a farrow-to-finish farm over the course of a year. G and P genotyping of GARs detected at each outbreak demonstrated genetic diversity in this farm as follows: G9P[23] was detected at the first outbreak, G9P[13]/[22] and G9P[23] at the second, G3P[7] at the third, and G9P[23], G5P[13]/[22], and P[7] combined with an untypeable G genotype at the fourth. Sequence analysis of the detected GARs revealed that such genetic diversity could have resulted not only from the introduction of new GAR strains, but also from gene reassortment between GAR strains within the farm. Further, the GAR strain carrying the untypeable G genotype was shown to be a novel porcine GAR bearing a new G26 genotype, as confirmed by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group.","publish_time":"2011-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miyazaki, Ayako; Kuga, Kazufumi; Suzuki, Tohru; Kohmoto, Mariko; Katsuda, Ken; Tsunemitsu, Hiroshi","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f33cc82e136a1cc89b2382e6fcc6ae520e364ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3245447.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-42-112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22067072/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["G and P","GAR","Rotavirus Classification Working Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detected GARs","G9P","porcine GARs","untypeable G genotype","P genotyping of GARs","molecular characteristics of GARs","diarrhea outbreaks","outbreaks of diarrhea","finish farm","number of G","novel porcine GAR","introduction of new GAR strains","new G26 genotype","suckling pigs","genetic diversity","P genotypes","Group","common causes of diarrhea","molecular epidemiology","farrow","gene reassortment","extended period of time","course","Sequence analysis","Rotavirus Classification","year","attempts","G5P","rotaviruses","G3P"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, the potential emergence of highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus poses a significant public health threat. Thus, the development of vaccines capable of eliciting long-lasting protective immunity to those pathogens is a major public health priority. CD8(\u002B) Tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells are a newly defined population that resides permanently in the nonlymphoid tissues including the lung. These cells are capable of providing local protection immediately after infection, thereby promoting rapid host recovery. Recent studies have offered new insights into the anatomical niches that harbor lung CD8(\u002B) T(RM) cells, and also identified the requirement and limitations of T(RM) maintenance. However, it remains controversial whether lung CD8(\u002B) T(RM) cells are continuously replenished by new cells from the circulation or permanently lodged in this site. A better understanding of how lung CD8(\u002B) T(RM) cells are generated and maintained and the tissue-specific factors that drive local T(RM) formation is required for optimal vaccine development. This review focuses on recent advance in our understanding of CD8(\u002B) T(RM) cell establishment and maintenance in the lung, and describes how those processes are uniquely regulated in this tissue.","publish_time":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takamura, Shiki","journal":"Viral Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f37e28d5d912f4361695c361f5400b0045b88005.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5512299.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28418771/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["local T","lung CD8","limitations of T","new cells","understanding of CD8","Tissue-resident memory T","respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenza virus","Respiratory virus infections","pathogenic strains of influenza virus","maintenance","tissue-specific factors","significant public health threat","local protection","major public health priority","new insights","recent advance","Recent studies","better understanding","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","optimal vaccine development","development of vaccines capable of eliciting long-lasting protective immunity","pathogens","RSV","SARS-CoV","formation","mortality","adenovirus","anatomical niches","cell establishment","substantial morbidity","children","rhinovirus","requirement","potential emergence","rapid host recovery","circulation","older adults","nonlymphoid tissues","defined population","review","processes","site"],"language":"en"},

We projected the number of excess suicides in Canada as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment. Annual suicide mortality (2000-2018) and unemployment (2000-2019) data were derived from Statistics Canada. Time-trend regression models were used to evaluate and predict the number of excess suicides in 2020 and 2021 for two possible projection scenarios following the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) an increase in unemployment of 1.6% in 2020, 1.2% in 2021, or 2) an increase in unemployment of 10.7% in 2020, 8.9% in 2021. A percentage point increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.0% increase in suicide between 2000-2018. In the first scenario, the rise in unemployment rates resulted in a projected total of 418 excess suicides in 2020-2021 (suicide rate per 100,000: 11.6 in 2020). In the second scenario, the projected suicide rates per 100,000 increased to 14.0 in 2020 and 13.6 in 2021, resulting in 2,114 excess suicides in 2020-2021. These results indicate that suicide prevention in the context of COVID-19-related unemployment is a critical priority.

SAPNs are formed from a peptide containing a pentameric and a trimeric coiled-coil domain. At near physiological conditions the peptide self-assembles into about 27nm, roughly spherical SAPNs. The average size of the SAPNs increases with the salt concentration. The optimal pH for their formation is between 7.5 and 8.5, while aggregation occurs at lower and higher values.

The infection of adult ducks with DHAV-1 was previously shown to result in transient cytokine storms in their kidneys. To understand how DHAV-1 infection impacts the host liver, we conducted animal experiments with the virulent CH DHAV-1 strain and the attenuated CH60 commercial vaccine strain. Visual observation and standard hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed to detect pathological damage in the liver, and viral copy numbers and cytokine expression in the liver were evaluated by quantitative PCR. The CH strain (10(8.4) copies/mg) had higher viral titers than the CH60 strain (10(4.9) copies/mg) in the liver and caused ecchymotic hemorrhaging on the liver surface. Additionally, livers from ducklings inoculated with the CH strain were significantly infiltrated by numerous red blood cells, accompanied by severe cytokine storms, but similar signs were not observed in the livers of ducklings inoculated with the CH60 strain. In conclusion, the severe cytokine storm caused by the CH strain apparently induces hemorrhagic lesions in the liver, which might be a key factor in the rapid death of ducklings.","publish_time":"2018-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Jinyan; Wang, Mingshu; Cheng, Anchun; Zhao, Xin-Xin; Liu, Mafeng; Zhu, Dekang; Chen, Shun; Jia, Renyong; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Zhang, Shaqiu; Liu, Yunya; Yu, Yanling; Zhang, Ling; Sun, Kunfeng; Chen, Xiaoyue","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/272b73f1f4852e9c37a862eab96131a5d27e1892.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5920089.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24729-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29700351/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CH strain","CH60 strain","host liver","liver surface","virulent CH DHAV","severe cytokine storms","attenuated CH60 commercial vaccine strain","cytokine expression","livers of ducklings","transient cytokine storms","copies","rapid death of ducklings","Duck hepatitis","duck industry","viral copy numbers","higher viral titers","infection of adult ducks","eosin staining","animal experiments","numerous red blood cells","standard hematoxylin","Visual observation","similar signs","key factor","virus type","pathological damage","hemorrhagic lesions","harmful pathogens","kidneys","conclusion","ecchymotic","quantitative PCR"],"language":"en"},

This process is mediated by virus surface envelope glycoprotein, in which the loop between residues D98\u2013G112 is considered to be crucial, acting as a fusion peptide. Here, we have characterized functionally and structurally the interaction between the DV fusion peptide and different model membranes by fluorescence and NMR. Its interaction was strongest in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles and anionic phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol vesicles, the only vesicle that was fused by DV fusion peptide. The three-dimensional structure of DV fusion peptide bound to DPC micelles was solved by solution homonuclear NMR with an r.m.s.d. of 0.98 \u00C5. The most striking result obtained from the solution structure was the hydrophobic triad formed by residues W101, L107, and F108, pointing toward the same direction, keeping the segment between G102 and G106 in a loop conformation. The interaction of DV fusion peptide with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol vesicles was also mapped by transfer-nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) experiments, in which the majority of the NOE cross-peaks were from the hydrophobic triad, corroborating the DPC-bound structure. Substitution of the residue W101 by an alanine residue completely abolished membrane binding and, thus, fusion by the peptide and its NOE cross-peaks. In conclusion, the 15-residue DV fusion peptide has intrinsic ability to promote membrane fusion, most likely due to the hydrophobic interaction among the residues W101, L107, and F108, which maintains its loop in the correct spatial conformation.","publish_time":"2009-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Melo, Manuel Nuno; Sousa, Francisco J.R.; Carneiro, Fabiana A.; Castanho, Miguel A.R.B.; Valente, Ana Paula; Almeida, Fabio C.L.; Da Poian, Andrea T.; Mohana-Borges, Ronaldo","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dece55ca4326ff6107a8b0fffc67afdccfeb9d51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094664.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619560/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.07.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283609008742; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283609008742","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DV","NMR","DPC","NOE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interaction of DV fusion peptide","residue DV fusion peptide","three-dimensional structure of DV fusion peptide","step of membrane fusion","hydrophobic interaction","residue W101","residues W101","DPC-bound structure","DPC micelles","hydrophobic triad","solution structure","loop conformation","NOE cross-peaks","alanine residue","phosphatidylglycerol vesicles","residues D98","F108","L107","abolished membrane binding","solution homonuclear NMR","anionic phosphatidylcholine","Summary Dengue virus","correct spatial conformation","virus surface envelope glycoprotein","different model membranes","intrinsic ability","infection","transfer-nuclear Overhauser enhancement","experiments","G102","fluorescence","dodecylphosphocholine","G106","G112","majority","segment","process","direction","striking result","acidic environment","endosome","Substitution","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

In both physiological (meals) and pathological (infections, traumas and tumors) conditions immune cells are activated responding with the release of cytokines and other immune mediators (afferent signals). In the hypothalamus (central integration), cytokines influence metabolism by acting on nucleus involved in feeding and homeostasis regulation leading to the acute phase response (efferent signals) aimed to maintain the body integrity. Peripheral administration of cytokines, inoculation of tumor and induction of infection alter, by means of cytokine action, the normal pattern of food intake affecting meal size and meal number suggesting that cytokines acted differentially on specific hypothalamic neurons. The effect of cytokines-related cancer anorexia is also exerted peripherally. Increase plasma concentrations of insulin and free tryptophan and decrease gastric emptying and d-xylose absorption. In addition, in obesity an increase in interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 occurs in mesenteric fat tissue, which together with an increase in corticosterone, is associated with hyperglycemia, dyslipidemias and insulin resistance of obesity-related metabolic syndrome. These changes in circulating nutrients and hormones are sensed by hypothalamic neurons that influence food intake and metabolism. In anorectic tumor-bearing rats, we detected upregulation of IL-1\u03B2 and IL-1 receptor mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, a negative correlation between IL-1 concentration in cerebro-spinal fluid and food intake and high levels of hypothalamic serotonin, and these differences disappeared after tumor removal. Moreover, there is an interaction between serotonin and IL-1 in the development of cancer anorexia as well as an increase in hypothalamic dopamine and serotonin production. Immunohistochemical studies have shown a decrease in neuropeptide Y (NPY) and dopamine (DA) and an increase in serotonin concentration in tumor-bearing rats, in first- and second-order hypothalamic nuclei, while tumor resection reverted these changes and normalized food intake, suggesting negative regulation of NPY and DA systems by cytokines during anorexia, probably mediated by serotonin that appears to play a pivotal role in the regulation of food intake in cancer. Among the different forms of therapy, nutritional manipulation of diet in tumor-bearing state has been investigated. Supplementation of tumor bearing rats with \u03C9-3 fatty acid vs. control diet delayed the appearance of tumor, reduced tumor-growth rate and volume, negated onset of anorexia, increased body weight, decreased cytokines production and increased expression of NPY and decreased \u03B1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03B1-MSH) in hypothalamic nuclei. These data suggest that \u03C9-3 fatty acid suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines production and improved food intake by normalizing hypothalamic food intake-related peptides and point to the possibility of a therapeutic use of these fatty acids. The sum of these data support the concept that immune cell-derived cytokines are closely related with the regulation of metabolism and have both central and peripheral actions, inducing anorexia via hypothalamic anorectic factors, including serotonin and dopamine, and inhibiting NPY leading to a reduction in food intake and body weight, emphasizing the interconnection of the immune and neuroendocrine systems in regulating metabolism during infectious process, cachexia and obesity.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guijarro, Ana; Laviano, Alessandro; Meguid, Michael M.","journal":"Progress in Brain Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02154d68d1d688f14983c90e35d4eb5f6e571205.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119041.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612306530225; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079612306530225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPY"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulation of food intake","hypothalamic food intake-related peptides","hypothalamic dopamine","improved food intake","normalized food intake","anorectic tumor","cytokines influence metabolism","release of cytokines","effect of cytokines","central hypothalamic levels","tumor resection","regulation of metabolism","inoculation of tumor","appearance of tumor","Supplementation of tumor","tumor removal","high levels of hypothalamic serotonin","decreased cytokines production","normal pattern of food intake","serotonin production","Peripheral administration of cytokines","immune cell-derived cytokines","hypothalamic anorectic factors","order hypothalamic nuclei","specific hypothalamic neurons","serotonin concentration","related cancer anorexia","negative regulation of NPY","pro-inflammatory cytokines production","upregulation of IL","reduced tumor-growth rate","homeostasis regulation","immune mediators","development of cancer anorexia","rats","inhibiting NPY","DA systems","neuroendocrine systems","increased expression of NPY","increased body weight","negated onset of anorexia","conditions immune cells","insulin resistance of obesity","central integration","fatty acids","hypothalamus","peripheral actions","changes","body integrity","related metabolic syndrome","data","decreased \u03B1-melanocyte","receptor mRNA levels","meal size","meal number","control diet","negative correlation","\u03B1-MSH","efferent signals","afferent signals","nutritional manipulation of diet","plasma concentrations of insulin","volume","gastric emptying","free tryptophan","cerebro-spinal fluid","traumas","tumors","concept","nucleus","reduction","acute phase response","infectious process","infections","hormones","interconnection","d-xylose absorption","different forms of therapy","neuropeptide Y","hyperglycemia","cytokine action","therapeutic use","possibility","dyslipidemias","cachexia","induction of infection","pivotal role","differences","circulating nutrients","meals","feeding","mesenteric fat tissue","interleukin","Immunohistochemical studies","sum","corticosterone","state","addition","interaction"],"language":"en"},

In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa 3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa 3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40- to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton translocating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry ( H\u002B e\u2212 ratio) of 0.66 \u00B1 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H\u002B e\u2212 ratio decreased to 0.280 \u00B1 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore. Low concentrations of gramicidin dissipate the membrane potential in COV most likely by a channel mechanism that is different from the carrier mechanism of valinomycin, yet does not make the phospholipid bilayer freely permeable to protons.","publish_time":"1991-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prochaska, Lawrence J.; Wilson, Kathryn S.","journal":"Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b84658904af7f828615c7de04ffcb088bd49c50d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000398619190605I; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/000398619190605I","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proton ionophore","higher concentrations of gramicidin","low concentrations of gramicidin","higher concentrations of valinomycin","proton translocating activity of COV","incubation of COV","gramicidin acts","Different concentrations","phospholipid bilayer","g phospholipid","similar apparent proton","proton translocation assay","proton translocating activities","fold","initial proton translocation reaction","carrier mechanism of valinomycin","redox-linked proton pump","Abstract Phospholipid vesicles","electron transfer activity","mobile potassium ionophore","higher rates of alkalinization","presence","ionophores","channel mechanism","absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa","bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase","observed H","similar efficiencies","rate of alkalinization","rapid equilibration of protons","extravesicular media","stoichiometry","membrane potential","Soret region","effect","perturbation","maximum respiratory control ratios","previous work","nm","hypothesis","agreement","functional properties","results","gramidicin","order","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

Mucosal vaccines are more favored to prevent mucosal infections from the portal of entry. Although mucosal vaccination has many advantages, licensed mucosal vaccines are scarce. The most widely studied mucosal routes are oral and intranasal. Licensed oral and intranasal vaccines are composed mostly of whole cell killed or live attenuated microorganisms serving as both delivery systems and built-in adjuvants. Future mucosal vaccines should be made with more purified antigen components, which will be relatively less immunogenic. To induce robust protective immune responses against well-purified vaccine antigens, an effective mucosal delivery system is an essential requisite. Recent developments in biomaterials and nanotechnology have enabled many innovative mucosal vaccine trials. For oral vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should be able to stably carry antigens and adjuvants and resist harsh physicochemical conditions in the stomach and intestinal tract. Besides many nano/microcarrier tools generated by using natural and chemical materials, the development of oral vaccine delivery systems using food materials should be more robustly researched to expand vaccine coverage of gastrointestinal infections in developing countries. For intranasal vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should survive the very active mucociliary clearance mechanisms and prove safety because of the anatomical location of nasal cavity separated by a thin barrier. Future mucosal vaccine carriers, regardless of administration routes, should have certain common characteristics.

The majority (91%) of the ERRPs agreed that their work put them at risk of infection, but most (65%) did not agree that they should not be looking after patients infected with MERS. Despite that, 54% of ERRPs reported being afraid of contracting the infection from infected patients and only 4.2% of them were willing to change their current job. The majority of the ERRPs (85%) felt that their job would expose their families to risk of infection. Conclusions.

Bats are reservoirs for a high diversity of coronaviruses, and focused surveillance detected several strains genetically similar to MERS-coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus, and the human coronaviruses 229E and NL63. The bat fauna of central Asia, which link China to eastern Europe, are relatively less studied than other regions of the world. Kazakhstan is the world\u2019s ninth largest country; however, little is understood about the prevalence and diversity of bat-borne viruses. In this study, bat guano was collected from bat caves in three different sites of southern Kazakhstan that tested positive for coronaviruses. Our phylogenetic reconstruction indicates these are novel bat coronaviruses that belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus. In addition, two distinct lineages of Kazakhstan bat coronaviruses were detected. Both lineages are closely related to bat coronaviruses from China, France, Spain, and South Africa, suggesting that co-circulation of coronaviruses is common in multiple bat species with overlapping geographical distributions.

Relevant publications were sought from data banks and repositories of FAO, OIE, WHO, and Google scholars. Substantiated data on HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in Africa and in humans across the world were mined. HPAI H5N1 affects poultry and human populations, with Egypt having highest human cases (346) globally. Nigeria had a reinfection from 2014 to 2015, with outbreaks in C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso throughout 2016 unabated. The persistence of this virus in Africa is attributed to the survivability of HPAIV, ability to evolve other subtypes through genetic reassortment, poor biosecurity compliance at the live bird markets and poultry farms, husbandry methods and multispecies livestock farming, poultry vaccinations, and continuous shedding of HPAIV, transboundary transmission of HPAIV through poultry trades; and transcontinental migratory birds. There is, therefore, the need for African nations to realistically reassess their status, through regular surveillance and be transparent with HPAI H5N1 outbreak data. Also, it is important to have an understanding of HPAIV migration dynamics which will be helpful in epidemiological modeling, disease prevention, control and eradication measures.","publish_time":"2017-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fasanmi, Olubunmi Gabriel; Odetokun, Ismail Ayoade; Balogun, Fatima Adeola; Fasina, Folorunso Oludayo","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38d6c3ecce86e079e55dcb9a1b33f2a239b3ba81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5682264.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29184365/; https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2017.1194-1204","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI","FAO","OIE","Google","HPAIV"],"locations":["Nigeria","Africa","Ghana","Burkina Faso"],"keyphrases":["HPAI H5N1 persistence","HPAI H5N1 outbreaks","HPAI H5N1 outbreak data","poultry farms","poultry trades","poultry vaccinations","survivability of HPAIV","Nigeria","data banks","utilizing data","Substantiated data","transboundary transmission of HPAIV","continuous shedding of HPAIV","understanding of HPAIV migration dynamics","appropriate control measures","human populations","pathogenic avian influenza virus","eradication measures","African nations","African countries","highest human cases","husbandry methods","live bird markets","poor biosecurity compliance","multispecies livestock farming","disease prevention","factors responsible","subtypes","Egypt","genetic reassortment","epidemiological modeling","OIE","qualitative evaluation","confirmed laboratory reports","Ghana","public health implications","C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire","regular surveillance","transcontinental migratory birds","status","Burkina Faso","repositories of FAO","Relevant publications","humans","Google scholars","need","world","study","reinfection"],"language":"en"},

Cases were tested for influenza A and B and conditional logistic regression was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness comparing influenza vaccination history of the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) among patients testing positive versus negative for influenza, adjusting for age and sex and matching by calendar week of recruitment. Results Overall vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B was estimated to be 61.7% (95% CI: 43.0%, 74.2%).

Methods Data on pulmonary lobectomy between 1999 and 2007 were abstracted from the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database. In-hospital mortality was analyzed by logistic regression, and log-transformed length of stay was analyzed by linear regression. Cross-sectional analysis of hospital volume, in-hospital mortality, and length of stay was performed, controlling for clustering. Within-hospital changes in annual volume on outcome was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression, controlling for Charlson comorbidity index and other confounders. Results Of 19,732 patients, 10, 281 (52%) were male, with an average age of 63.3 years. There was a 45% (95% confidence interval, 21\u201361; P = .001) relative risk reduction in in-hospital mortality with a 19% reduction in length of stay (95% confidence interval, 12\u201325; P \u003C .0001). On comparison of volume between hospitals, an increase of 20 cases was associated with a 15% relative risk reduction (95% confidence interval, 9\u201319; P \u003C .0001) in in-hospital mortality and a 5% relative decrease (95% confidence interval, 3\u20137; P \u003C .001) in length of stay. Within hospitals there was a nonsignificant relationship between volume and in-hospital mortality. Conclusions In-hospital mortality and length of stay for lobectomies have decreased in Canada. In multivariate analysis, volume was associated with improved in-hospital mortality, but there was no reduction in mortality when volume was increased within a given hospital. However, the proportion of patients treated in high-volume centers has increased over time, inferring the importance of high-volume centers in improved outcomes. This supports regionalization policies for pulmonary lobectomy.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Finley, Christian J.; Bendzsak, Anna; Tomlinson, George; Keshavjee, Shaf; Urbach, David R.; Darling, Gail E.","journal":"The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1946a131b5e601a86626bc59f3b13ac9a11b20e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094104.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.06.040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022522310006896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20850656/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022522310006896","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["hospital mortality","hospital changes","given hospital","length of stay","Cross-sectional analysis of hospital volume","hospital volumes of pulmonary lobectomy","confidence interval","annual volume","comparison of volume","relative risk reduction","time","multivariable logistic regression","linear regression","relative decrease","Canada","hospitals","importance of high-volume centers","effect of regionalization","regionalization policies","improved outcomes","multivariate analysis","proportion of patients","Health Information Discharge Abstract Database","thoracic surgery services","Canadian Institute","Charlson comorbidity index","impact","nonsignificant relationship","average age","confounders","Methods Data","increase","lobectomies","Conclusions","male","years","cases","Objective","Results","clustering"],"language":"en"},

Thus, due to its rapid action, passive immunisation is often used to treat disease caused by infection and/or toxin exposure. However immunoglobulins may also be administered prior to exposure to infection and/or toxin, although they will not provide long-lasting protection as is seen with active immunisation (vaccination) in which an immunological memory is established by controlled exposure of the host to the pathogen in question. With multi-factorial infectious diseases in production animals, especially those that have proven hard to control by vaccination, the potential of passive immunisation remains big. This review highlights a number of examples on the use of passive immunisation for the control of infectious disease in the modern production of a range of animals, including pigs, cattle, sheep, goat, poultry and fish. Special emphasis is given on the enablement of passive immunisation strategies in these production systems through low cost and ease of use as well as on the sources, composition and purity of immunoglobulin preparations used and their benefits as compared to current measures, including vaccination (also comprising maternal vaccination), antibiotics and feed additives such as spray-dried plasma. It is concluded that provided highly efficient, relatively low-price immunoglobulin products are available, passive immunisation has a clear role in the modern animal production sector as a means of controlling infectious diseases, importantly with a very low risk of causing development of bacterial resistance, thus constituting a real and widely applicable alternative to antibiotics.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedegaard, Chris J.; Heegaard, Peter M.H.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6175da18ca315727b067a3f1fb28da6601ff5295.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127230.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242716300642; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242716300642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185263/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.04.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of passive immunisation","potential of passive immunisation","active immunisation","Abstract Immunisation","enablement of passive immunisation strategies","modern production","production animals","infection","production systems","maternal vaccination","toxin exposure","control of infectious disease","modern animal production sector","efficient means","antibiotics","controlled exposure","sources","immunoglobulins","multi-factorial infectious diseases","low cost","low risk","range of animals","ease of use","short-lived protection","long-lasting protection","low-price immunoglobulin products","purity of immunoglobulin preparations","clear role","feed additives","sheep","goat","microbial pathogens","cattle","pigs","disease-causing effects of toxins","development of bacterial resistance","poultry","spray-dried plasma","benefits","host","composition","number of examples","administration of antibodies","immunological memory","fish","applicable alternative","current measures","rapid action","question","Special emphasis","review","years"],"language":"en"},

We conclusively show that SCoV E protein contains an unusually short, palindromic transmembrane helical hairpin around a previously unidentified pseudo-center of symmetry, a structural feature which seems to be unique to SCoV. The hairpin deforms lipid bilayers by way of increasing their curvature, providing for the first time a molecular explanation of E protein\u0027s pivotal role in viral budding.

Little is known about risk, presentation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in kidney transplantation recipients, who may be at high-risk due to long-term immunosuppression, comorbidity and residual chronic kidney disease. Whilst COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, in severe cases it can cause kidney and multi-organ failure. It is unknown if immunocompromised hosts are at higher risk of more severe systemic disease. Therefore, we report on seven cases of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (median age 54 (range 45-69), three females, from a cohort of 2082 managed transplant follow-up patients) over a six-week period in three south London hospitals. Two of 32 patients presented within three months of transplantation. Overall, two were managed on an out-patient basis, but the remaining five required hospital admission, four in intensive care units. All patients displayed respiratory symptoms and fever. Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, lymphopenia and high C-reactive protein. Very high D dimer, ferritin and troponin levels occurred in severe cases and likely prognostic. Immunosuppression was modified in six of seven patients. Three patients with severe disease were diabetic. During a three week follow up one patient recovered, and one patient died. Thus, our findings suggest COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant patients may be severe, requiring intensive care admission. The symptoms are predominantly respiratory and associated with fever. Most patients had their immunosuppression reduced and were treated with supportive therapy.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Debasish; Popoola, Joyce; Shah, Sapna; Ster, Irina Chis; Quan, Virginia; Phanish, Mysore","journal":"Kidney Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef5d09b7170e458e1f12db48db4a7e83e096f671.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7142878.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253820303616; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820303616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354637/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["kidney transplant patients","severe disease","severe cases","cases of COVID","respiratory disease","kidney transplant recipients","severe systemic disease","managed transplant follow-up patients","kidney transplantation recipients","residual chronic kidney disease","respiratory symptoms","intensive care admission","long-term immunosuppression","patient basis","fever","intensive care units","higher risk","outcomes of SARS","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","week period","months of transplantation","high D dimer","required hospital admission","high C-reactive protein","chest crepitation","lymphopenia","troponin levels","comorbidity","hypoxia","ferritin","median age","cohort","common clinical features","south London hospitals","immunocompromised hosts","presentation","likely prognostic","multi-organ failure","countries","infections","range","reported deaths","people","findings","supportive therapy","females"],"language":"en"},

Cellular transformation is associated with deregulated expression of the E6 and E7 oncogenes. E7 has been shown to bind a number of cellular proteins, including the cell cycle control protein pRb. In this study, RNA aptamers (small, single-stranded oligonucleotides selected for high-affinity binding) to HPV16 E7 were employed as molecular tools to further investigate these protein-protein interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study is focused on one aptamer (termed A2). Transfection of this molecule into HPV16-transformed cells resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation (shown using real-time cell electronic sensing and MTT assays) due to the induction of apoptosis (as demonstrated by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining). GST-pull down and bead binding assays were used to demonstrate that the binding of A2 required N-terminal residues of E7 known to be involved in interaction with the cell cycle control protein, pRb. Using a similar approach, A2 was shown to disrupt the interaction between E7 and pRb in vitro. Furthermore, transfection of HPV16-transformed cells with A2 appeared to result in the loss of E7 and rise in pRb levels, as observed by immunoblotting. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This paper includes the first characterisation of the effects of an E7 RNA aptamer in a cell line derived from a cervical carcinoma. Transfection of cells with A2 was correlated with the loss of E7 and the induction of apoptosis. Aptamers specific for a number of cellular and viral proteins have been documented previously; one aptamer (Macugen) is approved for clinical use and several others are in clinical trials. In addition to its role as a molecular tool, A2 could have further applications in the future.","publish_time":"2013-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicol, Clare; Cesur, \u00D6zlem; Forrest, Sophie; Belyaeva, Tamara A.; Bunka, David H.

There is no robust in vitro model for assessing the infectivity of emerging viruses in humans. Based on a recently established method, we generated long-term expanding 3D human airway organoids which accommodate four types of airway epithelial cells: ciliated, goblet, club, and basal cells. We report differentiation conditions which increase ciliated cell numbers to a nearly physiological level with synchronously beating cilia readily discernible in every organoid. In addition, the differentiation conditions induce elevated levels of serine proteases, which are essential for productive infection of human influenza viruses and low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses. We also established improved 2D monolayer culture conditions for the differentiated airway organoids. To demonstrate the ability of differentiated airway organoids to identify human-infective virus, 3D and 2D differentiated airway organoids are applied to evaluate two pairs of viruses with known distinct infectivity in humans, H7N9/Ah versus H7N2 and H1N1pdm versus an H1N1 strain isolated from swine (H1N1sw). The human-infective H7N9/Ah virus replicated more robustly than the poorly human-infective H7N2 virus; the highly human-infective H1N1pdm virus replicated to a higher titer than the counterpart H1N1sw. Collectively, we developed differentiated human airway organoids which can morphologically and functionally simulate human airway epithelium. These differentiated airway organoids can be applied for rapid assessment of the infectivity of emerging respiratory viruses to human.","publish_time":"2018-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Jie; Li, Cun; Sachs, Norman; Chiu, Man Chun; Wong, Bosco Ho-Yin; Chu, Hin; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Wang, Dong; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Wen, Lei; Song, Wenjun; Yuan, Shuofeng; Wong, Kenneth Kak-Yuen; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chen, Honglin; Clevers, Hans; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/793bb8ec176e4a5df8323e0bd2276e134b958b5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6042130.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1806308115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29891677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human-infective virus","D human airway organoids","human airway epithelium","human-infective H1N1pdm virus","human-infective H7N2 virus","D differentiated airway organoids","human-infective H7N9","human infections","ability of differentiated airway organoids","Ah virus","swine H1N1 virus","productive infection of human influenza viruses","infectivity of emerging viruses","Novel reassortant avian influenza H7N9 virus","avian H7N2","pairs of viruses","types of airway epithelial cells","infectivity of emerging respiratory viruses","low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses","differentiation conditions","D monolayer culture conditions","H1N1 strain","humans","known distinct infectivity","basal cells","counterpart H1N1sw","established method","ciliated cell numbers","pandemic","goblet","long-term expanding","elevated levels of serine proteases","higher titer","physiological level","club","rapid assessment","birds","model","addition","pigs"],"language":"en"},

In response, we designed a virtual radiation oncology medical student clerkship. Methods and Materials We convened an advisory panel to design a virtual clerkship curriculum. We implemented clerkship activities using a cloud-based learning management system, video web conferencing systems and a telemedicine portal. Students completed assessments pre- and post-clerkship to provide data to improve future versions of the clerkship. Results The virtual clerkship spans 2 weeks and is graded pass or fail. Students attend interactive didactic sessions during the first week and participate in virtual clinic and give talks to the department during the second week. Didactic sessions include lectures, case-based discussions, treatment planning seminars and material adapted from the Radiation Oncology Education Collaborative Study Group curriculum. Students also attend virtual departmental quality assurance rounds, cancer center seminars and multi-disciplinary tumor boards. The enrollment cap was met during the first virtual clerkship period (April 27 through May 8, 2020), with a total of 12 students enrolling. Conclusions Our virtual clerkship can increase student exposure and engagement in radiation oncology.

However, because of their capacity to suppress antigen presenting cells (APC), T and B cells, Tregs could also inhibit protective immune responses to viruses and vaccines. Several viruses have been shown to exploit Tregs to evade immune response. By modulating APC and in particular by weakening the functions of dendritic cells such as their ability to secrete polarizing cytokines and expression of co-stimulatory molecules, viruses could support differentiation and expansion of Tregs. Of note, as a proof of concept, depletion of Tregs significantly enhanced the protective immune response to viruses and vaccines suggesting that Tregs are viable targets to enhance immunogenicity of vaccines. As Treg depletion or inhibition of their functions could lead to deleterious autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, any Treg-based approach for vaccination should not aim at depletion of Tregs and inhibition of their functions should be transient. Recent studies have targeted the interaction between CCR4 expressed on Tregs and its ligands CCL22 and CCL17 to inhibit transiently the recruitment of Tregs at the site of immunization.

The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality.

Since 1935, research has been directed toward myelin of the central nervous system and the myelin sheaths of peripheral nerve; however, dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG) have apparently not been studied. The present hypothesis states that an infectious agent (probably viral) finds privileged sanctuary in the dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG): thereafter periodically invading the spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve. Previously reported erratic spinal fluid viral titers and cultures can be explained by differences in the anatomy of the DRG in which there is a variable and limited contact of spinal fluid with sensory ganglia. Clues to this hypothesis were noted by the author during routine neurological examinations of patients with MS, in which sensory signs and symptoms were frequently encountered. This clinical observation has also been reported by others who found such symptoms in 75% of MS patients, ranking second only to incoordination.","publish_time":"1993-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelson, D.

This chapter reviews several antiviral strategies that aim at counteracting the adaptive capacity of viral quasispecies. The proposed designs are based on combinations of different antiviral drugs and immune modulators, or in the administration of virus-specific mutagenic agents, in an approach termed lethal mutagenesis of viruses. It consists of decreasing viral fitness by an excess of mutations that render viral proteins suboptimal or nonfunctional. Viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis involves several sequential, overlapping steps that recapitulate the major concepts of intrapopulation interactions and genetic information stability discussed in preceding chapters. Despite the magnitude of the challenge, the chapter closes with some optimistic prospects for effective control of viruses displaying error-prone replication, based on the combined targeting of replication fidelity and the induction of the innate immune response.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Virus as Populations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3f6b652f5bbb394a6ca5eb515027a7ea9806e6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153320.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012816331300009X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012816331300009X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral extinction","viral fitness","viral disease control","antiviral designs","Abstract Viral populations","viral proteins suboptimal","antiviral interventions","antiviral strategies","adaptive capacity of viral quasispecies","combinations of different antiviral drugs","lethal mutagenesis of viruses","effective control of viruses","immune modulators","different fields","proposed designs","error-prone replication","innate immune response","combined targeting of replication fidelity","genetic information stability","true moving targets","induction","need","approach","new paradigms","major concepts of intrapopulation interactions","genomic sequences","specific mutagenic agents","excess of mutations","administration of virus","optimistic prospects","preceding chapters","steps","magnitude","challenge","Experts"],"language":"en"},

TB/HIV coinfections exert a tremendous burden on the host\u0027s immune system, and this has prompted the clinical use of immunomodulators to enhance host defences as an alternative therapeutic strategy. In this study, we modified the clinically used synthetic immunomodulatory pentapeptide, thymopentin (TP-5, RKDVY), with six arginine residues (RR-6, RRRRRR) at the N- and C-termini to obtain the cationic peptides, RR-11 (RKDVYRRRRRR-NH(2)) and RY-11 (RRRRRRRKDVY-NH(2)), respectively. The arginine residues conferred anti-mycobacterial activity to TP-5 in the peptides as shown by effective minimum inhibitory concentrations of 125 mg/L and killing efficiencies of \u003E99.99% against both rifampicin-susceptible and -resistant Mycobacterium smegmatis. The immunomodulatory action of the peptides remained unaffected as shown by their ability to stimulate TNF-\u03B1 production in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells. A distinct change in surface morphology after peptide treatment was observed in scanning electron micrographs, while confocal microscopy and dye leakage studies suggested bacterial membrane disruption by the modified peptides. The modified peptides were non-toxic and did not cause hemolysis of rat red blood cells up to a concentration of 2000 mg/L. Moreover, RY-11 showed synergism with rifampicin and reduced the effective concentration of rifampicin, while preventing the induction of rifampicin resistance. The synthetic peptides may have a potential application in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised TB patients.","publish_time":"2014-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ying; Ke, Xi-Yu; Khara, Jasmeet S.; Bahety, Priti; Liu, Shaoqiong; Seow, See Voon; Yang, Yi Yan; Ee, Pui Lai Rachel","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b76ab46e8f00ac910b6ac39a8d7d4ca7b75564f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124552.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.12.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411680/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961213015330; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961213015330","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modified peptides","synthetic peptides","cationic peptides","resistant TB","effective concentration of rifampicin","rifampicin-susceptible","TP","immunocompromised TB patients","arginine residues","induction of rifampicin resistance","synthetic immunomodulatory pentapeptide","HIV coinfections","Effective global control of tuberculosis","effective minimum inhibitory concentrations","immunomodulatory action","RKDVYRRRRRR-NH","RRRRRRRKDVY-NH","mouse macrophage cells","resistant Mycobacterium smegmatis","hemolysis of rat red blood cells","confocal microscopy","dye leakage studies","bacterial membrane disruption","peptide treatment","host defences","tremendous burden","human immunodeficiency virus","scanning electron micrographs","TNF-\u03B1 production","potential application","surface morphology","thymopentin","anti-mycobacterial activity","distinct change","alternative therapeutic strategy","host\u0027s immune system","ability","clinical use of immunomodulators","C-termini","convergence of multidrug","synergism","study","efficiencies"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, many diseases are not yet preventable by vaccination. This large unmet medical need demands further research and the development of novel vaccines with high efficacy and safety. Compared to the 19th and early 20th century vaccines that were made of killed, inactivated, or live-attenuated pathogens, modern vaccines containing isolated, highly purified antigenic protein subunits are safer but tend to induce lower levels of protective immunity. One strategy to overcome the latter is to design antigen nanoparticles: assemblies of polypeptides that present multiple copies of subunit antigens in well-ordered arrays with defined orientations that can potentially mimic the repetitiveness, geometry, size, and shape of the natural host-pathogen surface interactions. Such nanoparticles offer a collective strength of multiple binding sites (avidity) and can provide improved antigen stability and immunogenicity. Several exciting advances have emerged lately, including preclinical evidence that this strategy may be applicable for the development of innovative new vaccines, for example, protecting against influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Here, we provide a concise review of a critical selection of data that demonstrate the potential of this field. In addition, we highlight how the use of self-assembling protein nanoparticles can be effectively combined with the emerging discipline of structural vaccinology for maximum impact in the rational design of vaccine antigens.","publish_time":"2015-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00F3pez-Sagaseta, Jacinto; Malito, Enrico; Rappuoli, Rino; Bottomley, Matthew J.","journal":"Comput Struct Biotechnol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2fc5ae2867a0bc478fbd993c240bd7e59531e66.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f174e535b5e88cadd50d5684bed11710973f598e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4706605.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S200103701530009X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S200103701530009X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2015.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26862374/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modern vaccines","century vaccines","development of novel vaccines","antigen nanoparticles","development of innovative new vaccines","strategy","use of self-assembling protein nanoparticles","rational design of vaccine antigens","present multiple copies of subunit antigens","human immunodeficiency virus","respiratory syncytial virus","effective medical interventions","improved antigen stability","purified antigenic protein subunits","large unmet medical need","collective strength of multiple binding sites","maximum impact","research","well-ordered arrays","assemblies of polypeptides","avidity","shape","emerging discipline of structural vaccinology","defined orientations","example","high efficacy","natural host-pathogen surface interactions","live-attenuated pathogens","critical selection of data","size","infectious disease","influenza","safety","lower levels of protective immunity","concise review","potential","geometry","repetitiveness","preclinical evidence","immunogenicity","millions of lives","diseases","vaccination","exciting advances","field","addition","years"],"language":"en"},

However, dsRNA is also present in many cellular RNAs, raising a question of how these receptors and effectors discriminate between viral and cellular dsRNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that innate immune sensors detect not only dsRNA structure but also other and often multiple features of RNA such as length, sequence, cellular location, post-transcriptional processing and modification, which are divergent between viral and cellular RNAs.

The present results suggest that binding of a mAb to phosphoinositides, resulting in secretion of \u03B2-chemokines into the culture medium and neutralization of infection by CCR5-tropic HIV-1 of nearby susceptible cells, occurred by uptake and binding of the mAb at an intracellular location in the cultured cells that then led to secretion of HIV-1-inhibitory \u03B2-chemokines.","publish_time":"2010-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matyas, Gary R.; Wieczorek, Lindsay; Bansal, Divya; Chenine, Agnes-Laurence; Sanders-Buell, Eric; Tovanabutra, Sodsai; Kim, Jerome H.; Polonis, Victoria; Alving, Carl R.","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96a8ada05d6b2cc0001aca4bb8aeff2a383e00dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173129.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X10020139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21040700/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X10020139; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.10.124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Murine"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["susceptible cells","secretion of HIV","WR321 mAb","interaction of HIV","CCR5-tropic HIV","interactions of HIV","variety of cultured cells","external surface of cells","secretion of chemokines","phosphatidylinositol","neutralized CCR5-tropic strains of HIV","murine IgG mAb","secretion of \u03B2","primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells","neutralization of infection","binding","inhibitory \u03B2-chemokines","inhibition of infection","Phosphoinositides","culture medium","direct interaction","inner surface","Murine anti-phosphoinositide mAbs similar","cytoplasmic leaflet","important changes","intracellular location","virions","uptake","plasma membrane","bisphosphate","functions","probe","coreceptor","present results","inability","lipids"],"language":"en"},

UK emergency planning will be improved if planners have a better understanding of the reasons UK HCWs may have for their absenteeism, and what might motivate them to work during an influenza pandemic. This paper reports the results of a qualitative study that explored UK HCWs\u0027 views (n = 64) about working during an influenza pandemic, in order to identify factors that might influence their willingness and ability to work and to identify potential sources of any perceived duty on HCWs to work. METHODS: A qualitative study, using focus groups (n = 9) and interviews (n = 5). RESULTS: HCWs across a range of roles and grades tended to feel motivated by a sense of obligation to work through an influenza pandemic. A number of significant barriers that may prevent them from doing so were also identified. Perceived barriers to the ability to work included being ill oneself, transport difficulties, and childcare responsibilities. Perceived barriers to the willingness to work included: prioritising the wellbeing of family members; a lack of trust in, and goodwill towards, the NHS; a lack of information about the risks and what is expected of them during the crisis; fear of litigation; and the feeling that employers do not take the needs of staff seriously. Barriers to ability and barriers to willingness, however, are difficult to separate out. CONCLUSION: Although our participants tended to feel a general obligation to work during an influenza pandemic, there are barriers to working, which, if generalisable, may significantly reduce the NHS workforce during a pandemic. The barriers identified are both barriers to willingness and to ability. This suggests that pandemic planning needs to take into account the possibility that staff may be absent for reasons beyond those currently anticipated in UK planning documents. In particular, staff who are physically able to attend work may nonetheless be unwilling to do so. Although there are some barriers that cannot be mitigated by employers (such as illness, transport infrastructure etc.), there are a number of remedial steps that can be taken to lesson the impact of others (providing accommodation, building reciprocity, provision of information and guidance etc). We suggest that barriers to working lie along an ability/willingness continuum, and that absenteeism may be reduced by taking steps to prevent barriers to willingness becoming perceived barriers to ability.","publish_time":"2009-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ives, Jonathan; Greenfield, Sheila; Parry, Jayne M; Draper, Heather; Gratus, Christine; Petts, Judith I; Sorell, Tom; Wilson, Sue","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c337fa83ebb25e4600c0f9333ee0cb0fa938e947.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2654560.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-56; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216738/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","UK","NHS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Perceived barriers","pandemic influenza","influenza pandemic","number of significant barriers","number of HCWs","reasons UK HCWs","pandemic planning needs","UK healthcare system\u0027s ability","willingness continuum","UK emergency planning","perceived duty","needs of staff","qualitative study","lack of information","employers","results","number of remedial steps","absenteeism","crisis","lack of trust","transport difficulties","general obligation","Healthcare workers","provision of information","sense of obligation","transport infrastructure","NHS workforce","better understanding","account","key role","reciprocity","planners","range of roles","focus groups","potential sources","response","lie","wellbeing of family members","fear of litigation","accommodation","grades","participants","childcare responsibilities","feeling","guidance","illness","goodwill","possibility","BACKGROUND","large extent","order","factors","risks","paper","METHODS","interviews","impact","CONCLUSION","documents"],"language":"en"},

After isolation in cell culture, the novel isolate was analysed by RT-PCR and the amplicons obtained were sequenced. In order to characterize the growth properties of the isolate, the size of the plaques, the temperature of inactivation and the kinetics of growth were evaluated. Moreover, the novel strain was used to perform a serological study on 86 canine serum samples and 81 feline sera by virus-neutralization assay. The comparative analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the isolate, named FCV-Te/10/07, revealed the highest identity to strain FCV-F65. The growth kinetic revealed that strain Te/10/07 grew more rapidly than F9 strain. By virus-neutralization assay, dogs from the same region of the isolate showed antibodies against the FCV-F9 vaccinal strain in 63.9% (55/86) of sera, while antibodies against the Te/10/07 were found in seven sera (8.13%). In cats neutralizing antibodies against Te/10/07 strain were recovered in 50.62% (41/81) of samples tested, even if 38 sera were positives for F9 strain with similar titres or higher. In three cats neutralization to Te/10/07 alone was seen. Our results confirmed the interspecific circulation of FCV strains among different animal species, but new investigations are needed to establish whether FCV is pathogenic in the dog and the role of interspecies circulation in pathogen spreading.","publish_time":"2009-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Martino, Barbara; Di Rocco, Camillo; Ceci, Chiara; Marsilio, Fulvio","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c58a36f89817205dff8e8261a70cbe0fa7496b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126684.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481376/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509002508; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509002508; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.04.033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strain Te","FCV-Te","F9 strain","novel strain","FCV-F9 vaccinal strain","FCV-F65","feline sera","novel isolate","antibodies","interspecific circulation of FCV strains","cats neutralization","virus-neutralization assay","dogs","growth properties","kinetics of growth","growth kinetic revealed","canine serum samples","role of interspecies circulation","epidemiological understanding of feline calicivirus","different animal species","amino acid sequences","similar titres","positives","phenotypic characterizations","comparative analysis of nucleotide","new investigations","serological study","temperature of inactivation","plaques","size","cell culture","region","RT-PCR","highest identity","isolation","pathogen","results","puppy","amplicons","order","enteritis"],"language":"en"},

The misregulation of ncRNA function has been linked with a variety of diseases and disorders ranging from cancers to neurodegeneration. However, a detailed molecular understanding of how ncRNAs function has been limited; due, in part, to the difficulties associated with obtaining high\u2010resolution structures of large RNAs. Tertiary structure determination of RNA as a whole is hampered by various technical challenges, all of which are exacerbated as the size of the RNA increases.

Biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers a viable alternative to determining the structure of large RNA molecules that do not readily crystallize, but is itself hindered by some technical limitations. Recently, a series of advancements have allowed the biomolecular NMR field to overcome, at least in part, some of these limitations. These advances include improvements in sample preparation strategies as well as methodological improvements. Together, these innovations pave the way for the study of ever larger RNA molecules that have important biological function. RNA Structure and Dynamics \u003E RNA Structure, Dynamics, and Chemistry.

Many vaccine strategies developed to control the disease are not yet completely successful. Hairpin expression vectors have been used to induce gene silencing in a large number of studies on viruses. However, none of these studies has been attempted to study GTPV. In the interest of exploiting improved methods to control goat pox, it is participated that RNAi may provide effective protection against GTPV. In this study we show the suppression of Goatpox virus (GTPV) replication via knockdown of virion core protein using RNA interference. RESULTS: Four short interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences (siRNA-61, siRNA-70, siRNA-165 and siRNA-296) against a region of GTPV ORF095 were selected. Sense and antisense siRNA-encoding sequences separated by a hairpin loop sequence were designed as short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes under the control of a human U6 promoter. ORF095 amplicon was generated using PCR, and then cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector, named as p095/EGFP. p095/EGFP and each of the siRNA expression cassettes (p61, p70, p165 and p296) were co-transfected into BHK-21 cells. Fluorescence detection, flow cytometric analysis, retro transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and real time PCR were used to check the efficiency of RNAi. The results showed that the ORF095-specific siRNA-70 effectively down-regulated the expression of ORF095. When Vero cells were transfected with shRNA expression vectors (p61/GFP, p70/GFP, p165/GFP and p296/GFP) and then infected with GTPV, GTPV-ORF095-70 was found to be the most effective inhibition site in decreasing cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by GTPV. The results presented here indicated that DNA-based siRNA could effectively inhibit the replication of GTPV (approximately 463. 5-fold reduction of viral titers) on Vero cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that vector-based shRNA methodology can effectively inhibit GTPV replication on Vero cells. Simultaneously, this work represents a strategy for controlling goatpox, potentially facilitating new experimental approaches in the analysis of both viral and cellular gene functions during of GTPV infection.","publish_time":"2012-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Zhixun; Wu, Guohua; Zhu, Xueliang; Yan, Xinmin; Dou, Yongxi; Li, Jian; Zhu, Haixia; Zhang, Qiang; Cai, Xuepeng","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/210ebd55fd095ff2fb393e871fea70815a9ead75.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3298800.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22340205/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-48","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Goatpox"],"organizations":["GTPV","CPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GTPV-ORF095","replication of GTPV","GTPV replication","GTPV infection","siRNA expression cassettes","region of GTPV ORF095","antisense siRNA","expression of ORF095","ORF095-specific siRNA","DNA-based siRNA","Vero cells","shRNA expression vectors","Hairpin expression vectors","control","RESULTS","study","ORF095 amplicon","short hairpin RNA","RT-PCR","p165","sequences","p70","p61","short interfering RNA","retro transcription PCR","RNA interference","p296","vector-based shRNA methodology","real time PCR","p095","hairpin loop sequence","suppression of Goatpox virus","cytometric analysis","gene silencing","important disease","goat pox","effective protection","efficiency of RNAi","cellular gene functions","effective inhibition site","large number of studies","pEGFP-N1 vector","fold reduction of viral titers","knockdown of virion core protein","cytopathic effect","sheep","new experimental approaches","CPE","BHK","Fluorescence detection","human U6 promoter","areas","improved methods","viruses","world","vaccine strategies","work","strategy","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

It is possible to completely sequence a small genome within days and this increases the number of publicly available genomes. Among the types of genomes being rapidly sequenced are those of microbial and viral genomes responsible for infectious diseases. However, accurate gene prediction is a challenge that persists for decoding a newly sequenced genome. Therefore, accurate and efficient gene prediction programs are highly desired for rapid and cost effective surveillance of RNA viruses through full genome sequencing. RESULTS: We have developed VIGOR (Viral Genome ORF Reader), a web application tool for gene prediction in influenza virus, rotavirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus subtypes. VIGOR detects protein coding regions based on sequence similarity searches and can accurately detect genome specific features such as frame shifts, overlapping genes, embedded genes, and can predict mature peptides within the context of a single polypeptide open reading frame. Genotyping capability for influenza and rotavirus is built into the program. We compared VIGOR to previously described gene prediction programs, ZCURVE_V, GeneMarkS and FLAN. The specificity and sensitivity of VIGOR are greater than 99% for the RNA viral genomes tested. CONCLUSIONS: VIGOR is a user friendly web-based genome annotation program for five different viral agents, influenza, rotavirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and SARS coronavirus. This is the first gene prediction program for rotavirus and rhinovirus for public access. VIGOR is able to accurately predict protein coding genes for the above five viral types and has the capability to assign function to the predicted open reading frames and genotype influenza virus.

The nearly complete genome comprised 6579 nt in length and displayed the archetypal organization of astroviruses. The present report is the first evidence of MAstV5 infection in an animal species other than the dog and highlights a possible natural astrovirus spillover between domestic and wild canids.

It emerged as a global pandemic early in 2020, affecting more than 2000 countries and territories. The infection is highly contagious with disease transmission reported from asymptomatic carriers, including children. It spreads through person-to-person contact, via aerosol and droplets. The practice of social distancing \u2013 maintaining a distance of 1 \u2013 2 meters or 6 feet -- between people has been widely recommended to slow or halt the spread. This places orthodontists at high risk of acquiring and transmitting the infection. The objective of this review is to report to orthodontists on the emergence, epidemiology, risks, and precautions during disease crisis. This should help increase awareness, reinforce infection control and prevent cross-transmission within the orthodontic facility. Methods A comprehensive literature review of English and non-English articles was performed in March, 2020 using (CORD-19 2020) dataset, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar to search for infection control and disease transmission in orthodontics. Results This review emphasizes minimizing aerosol production and reinforcing strict infection control measures. Compliance with highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak. Surface disinfection, adequate ventilation, and decontamination of instruments and supplies following the guidelines is required. Conclusion Reinforcing strict infection control measures and minimizing personal contact and aerosol production are keys to prevent contamination within the orthodontic settings. Although no cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within a dental facility have been reported, the risk exists and the disease is still emerging. Further studies are required.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turkistani, Khadijah A.","journal":"Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16147aa2936b9873de0cd70eea06304353cbc834.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889540620302778?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405152/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889540620302778; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajodo.2020.04.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease transmission","contagious disease","strict infection control measures","disease crisis","cross-transmission","minimizing aerosol production","Abstract Introduction Coronavirus disease","personal contact","person contact","cases of COVID","orthodontic facility","comprehensive literature review of English","emergency cases","dental facility","places orthodontists","high risk","orthodontic settings","highest level of personal protection","restriction of treatment","keys","decontamination of instruments","adequate ventilation","MEDLINE","Scopus","risks","Google Scholar","non-English articles","asymptomatic carriers","dataset","epidemiology","Compliance","Methods","precautions","Conclusion","orthodontics","Surface disinfection","SARS-CoV","distance","supplies","PubMed","emergence","droplets","practice of social distancing","feet","meters","guidelines","children","outbreak","awareness","global pandemic","countries","territories","people","CORD","objective","spread","studies"],"language":"en"},

TCoV nsp15 consists of 338 residues and shares 40% sequence similarity to U-specific Nidovirales endoribonuclease (NendoU) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to characterize TCoV nsp15. METHODS: The TCoV nsp15 gene was cloned into pTriEX1 and expressed as a C-terminal His-tagged recombinant protein in BL21 (DE3). The recombinant nsp15 was purified by Ni-NTA resin. Synthetic RNA substrates were used to determine the substrate specificity of the TCoV nsp15. RNA zymography was used to determine the active form of the nsp15. RESULTS: The TCoV nsp15 did not cleave DNA but degraded total cellular RNA. The TCoV nsp15 cleaved single-stranded (ss) RNA at the uridylate site. The TCoV nsp15 cleaved hairpin RNA, pRNA, and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of infectious bursal disease virus very slowly, implying that dsRNA is not a good substrate for the TCoV nsp15. No divalent metal ion was required for in vitro enzymatic activity of the TCoV nsp15. The active form of the TCoV nsp15 was a homohexamer and disulfide bond was essential for the enzymatic activity. CONCLUSION: The TCoV nsp15 is a NendoU but has some characteristics different from other NendoU.","publish_time":"2008-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Jianzhong; Wu, Ching-Ching; Lin, Tsang Long","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62358b1c3b6748bbdd18a51606c7f6e12986bda1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179563.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000175837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19023218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TCoV nsp15 gene","recombinant nsp15","TCoV nsp15 cleaved hairpin RNA","RNA zymography","NendoU","double-stranded RNA","total cellular RNA","Synthetic RNA substrates","dsRNA","enzymatic activity","active form","good substrate","recombinant protein","substrate specificity","Turkey coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pRNA","U-specific Nidovirales endoribonuclease","sequence similarity","disulfide bond","infectious bursal disease virus","shares","ss","residues","homohexamer","DNA","present study","pTriEX1","non-structural proteins","nsp2","nsp16","purpose","BL21","DE3","divalent metal ion","C-terminal","Ni-NTA resin","uridylate site","characteristics different","polyprotein","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","nsps"],"language":"en"},

A post-epidemic evaluation of the effectiveness of travel restrictions has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions in reducing the risk of importation from mid-August to September, 2014, using a simple hazard-based statistical model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The hazard rate was modeled as an inverse function of the effective distance, an excellent predictor of disease spread, which was calculated from the airline transportation network. By analyzing datasets of the date of EVD case importation from the 15(th) of July to the 15(th) of September 2014, and assuming that the network structure changed from the 8(th) of August 2014 because of travel restrictions, parameters that characterized the hazard rate were estimated. The absolute risk reduction and relative risk reductions due to travel restrictions were estimated to be less than 1% and about 20%, respectively, for all models tested. Effectiveness estimates among African countries were greater than those for other countries outside Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The travel restrictions were not effective enough to expect the prevention of global spread of Ebola virus disease. It is more efficient to control the spread of disease locally during an early phase of an epidemic than to attempt to control the epidemic at international borders. Capacity building for local containment and coordinated and expedited international cooperation are essential to reduce the risk of global transmission.","publish_time":"2016-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otsuki, Shiori; Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e96b011c26501fc8432fd96787fe0aba49a08e0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5033593.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27657544/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVD"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of travel restrictions","spread of disease","risk of importation","serious risk of global spread","risk of global transmission","epidemic of Ebola virus disease","prevention of global spread of Ebola virus disease","excellent predictor of disease spread","hazard rate","relative risk reductions","absolute risk reduction","Effectiveness estimates","early phase","simple hazard","post-epidemic evaluation","early growth phase","effective distance","date of EVD case importation","African countries","international cooperation","international borders","network structure","airline transportation network","local containment","inverse function","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","parameters","Capacity building","datasets","statistical model","METHODOLOGY","BACKGROUND","present study","CONCLUSIONS","models"],"language":"en"},

Sia may be present in variant forms that include O-acetyl modifications at C4, C7, C8, and C9 positions, and N-acetyl or N-glycolyl at C5. They can also vary in their linkages, including \u03B12-3 or \u03B12-6-linkages. Here, we analyzed the distribution of modified Sia in cells and tissues of wild-type mice, or in mice lacking cytidine 5\u2019-monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) enzyme that synthesizes N-glycolyl modifications (Neu5Gc). We also examined the variation of Sia forms on erythrocytes and saliva from different animals. To determine the effect of Sia modifications on influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we tested for effects on hemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl, 7,9-O-acetyl, 4-O-acetyl, and Neu5Gc modifications are widely but variably expressed in mouse tissues, with the highest levels detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Secreted mucins in saliva and surface proteins of erythrocytes showed a great degree of variability in display of modified Sia between different species. IAV HA from different virus strains showed consistently reduced binding to both Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modified Sia; however, while IAV NA were inhibited by Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modifications, there was significant variability between NA types. The modifications of Sia in mucus may therefore have potent effects on the functions of IAV, and may affect both pathogens and the normal flora of different mucosal sites. Sialic acids (Sia) are involved in many different cellular functions and are receptors for many pathogens. Sia come in many chemically modified forms but we lack a clear understanding of how they alter the interactions with microbes. Here we examine the expression of modified Sia in mouse tissues, on secreted mucus in saliva, and on erythrocytes, including those from IAV host species and animals used in IAV research. These Sia forms varied considerably between different animals, and their inhibitory effects on IAV NA and HA activities and on bacterial sialidases (neuraminidases) suggest a host-variable protective role in secreted mucus.","publish_time":"2019-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnard, Karen N.; Alford-Lawrence, Brynn K.; Buchholz, David W.; Wasik, Brian R.; LaClair, Justin R.; Yu, Hai; Honce, Rebekah; Ruhl, Stefan; Pajic, Petar; Daugherity, Erin K.; Chen, Xi; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey L.; Aguilar, Hector C.; Varki, Ajit; Parrish, Colin R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a791c5c6543aca9391b77ae58b79d7ddf3c1f3c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/229ed19c0a0257e55a00243af0185c835c4923f7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/800300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sia"],"organizations":["Sia","IAV NA","NA","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modifications of Sia","O-acetyl modifications","effect of Sia modifications","display of modified Sia","expression of modified Sia","distribution of modified Sia","variation of Sia forms","N-acetyl","IAV NA","IAV HA","Neu5Gc modifications","different animals","functions of IAV","modified forms","different species","N-glycolyl modifications","secreted mucus","IAV research","IAV host species","different virus strains","saliva","different cellular functions","monophosphate-N","mouse tissues","variant forms","Secreted mucins","NA types","HA activities","binding","tissues of wild","inhibitory effects","potent effects","normal flora of different mucosal sites","pathogens","Sialic acids","\u03B12","linkages","surface proteins of erythrocytes","significant variability","type mice","primary receptors","influenza viruses","great degree of variability","host-variable protective role","enzyme","acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase","CMAH","C7","cells","neuraminidases","C8","bacterial sialidases","C9 positions","C4","highest levels","cytidine","hemagglutinin","infection","cleavage","clear understanding","cell surfaces","C5","gastrointestinal tracts","interactions","microbes"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 52% of 940 samples analyzed, with 3% showing co-infections. The most frequently detected agents were rhinoviruses and influenza A, all representing the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain. The incidence of influenza H1N1-positive samples was highest in late spring 2009, followed by a decline in summer and early fall, when rhinovirus infections became predominant before H1N1 reemerged in winter. Our study also identified a focal outbreak of enterovirus 68 in the early fall of 2009. CONCLUSION: MassTag multiplex PCR affords opportunities to track the epidemiology of infectious diseases and may guide clinicians and public health practitioners in influenza-like illness and outbreak management. Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of influenza-like illness remains unexplained underscoring the need for additional platforms.","publish_time":"2011-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tokarz, Rafal; Kapoor, Vishal; Wu, Winfred; Lurio, Joseph; Jain, Komal; Mostashari, Farzad; Briese, Thomas; Ian Lipkin, W","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/395bd0f3cc06cf1757d8c8558b1631494d6f946b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3121709.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21658237/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-288","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of influenza H1N1-positive samples","substantial proportion of influenza","illness","early fall","MassTag PCR","MassTag multiplex PCR","pandemic H1N1 strain","pilot respiratory virus surveillance system","rhinovirus infections","outbreak management","co-infections","detected agents","respiratory disease symptoms","focal outbreak of enterovirus","longitudinal study of viral etiology","context","opportunities","clinicians","unexplained underscoring","need","public health practitioners","late spring","additional platforms","epidemiology of infectious diseases","outpatients","fever","New York City","decline","CONCLUSION","summer","rhinoviruses","presence","BACKGROUND","winter","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine.

On the other hand, viral infections of the airway are associated with the acute exacerbations of COPD. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the prevalence rate of viral infections in acute exacerbations of COPD patients. METHODS: PubMed database was systematically searched for population-based prevalence studies (1930\u20132017). Fixed and random effects models were used for estimation of summary effect-sizes. Between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were also calculated. \u201CViral infections\u201D and \u201CCOPD patients with exacerbations\u201D were the two critical inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were selected out of 26078 articles for the present review. The overall estimation of the prevalence of viral infection was 0.374 (95% C.I: 0.359\u20130.388). Also, the evident heterogeneity of viral infection was observed among the studies (Cochran Q test, p value \u003C 0.001 and I-squared = 97.5%). The highest and lowest prevalence rate was related to rhinovirus and echovirus, respectively. Also, the results of this study showed that the prevalence of viral infection in exacerbated COPD patients has fluctuation during the years with a slight increase and decrease. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review demonstrated that respiratory viral infections have an important role in the acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). In addition, determining the exact geographic epidemiology of these viruses is very important to manage the treatment of these infections.","publish_time":"2017-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jafarinejad, Habib; Moghoofei, Mohsen; Mostafaei, Shayan; Salimian, Jafar; Azimzadeh Jamalkandi, Sadegh; Ahmadi, Ali","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1cb64fa097f94efbeadfdc5e98ed7d9d0e58f87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127529.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.10.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29038056/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401017310598; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401017310598","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of viral infection","prevalence rate of viral infections","respiratory viral infections","acute exacerbations of COPD patients","acute exacerbation of COPD","exacerbated COPD patients","evident heterogeneity of viral infection","RESULTS","lowest prevalence rate","population-based prevalence studies","systematic review","present review","study heterogeneity","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","important role","chronic progressive lung disease","overall estimation","estimation of summary effect-sizes","fluctuation","Cochran Q test","OBJECTIVE","years","airway","p value","exact geographic epidemiology","viruses","BACKGROUND","rhinovirus","meta-analysis","random effects models","PubMed database","addition","publication bias","articles","AECOPD","hand","critical inclusion criteria","slight increase","METHODS","echovirus","CONCLUSIONS","treatment"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe the identification and crystal structures of four distinct \u03B1-helical domains derived from the highly conserved heptad-repeat (HR) regions of the S2 fusion subunit. The four domains are an antiparallel four-stranded coiled coil, a parallel trimeric coiled coil, a four-helix bundle, and a six-helix bundle that is likely the final fusogenic form of the protein. When considered together, the structural and thermodynamic features of the four domains suggest a possible mechanism whereby the HR regions, initially sequestered in the native S glycoprotein spike, are released and refold sequentially to promote membrane fusion. Our results provide a structural framework for understanding the control of membrane fusion and should guide efforts to intervene in the SARS coronavirus entry process.","publish_time":"2006-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Yiqun; Liu, Jie; Zheng, Qi; Yong, Wei; Lu, Min","journal":"Structure","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a60a5e51f2d4d1e5e64599a5ae4caaf511bfbe49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127249.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212606001729; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969212606001729","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control of membrane fusion","HR regions","structural framework","helix bundle","S2 fusion subunit","native S glycoprotein spike","Summary Entry of SARS coronavirus","SARS coronavirus entry process","large-scale structural transitions","parallel trimeric coiled coil","viral spike","target cell","distinct \u03B1-helical domains","cell membranes","final fusogenic form","order","conserved heptad-repeat","crystal structures","possible mechanism","efforts","identification","thermodynamic features","results"],"language":"en"},

However, the role of this cellular protein was not evaluated during replication of alphaviruses including chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Using siRNA, chemical inhibitors, and trans-replication assays, we show here that VCP is a proviral factor involved in the replication of CHIKV. Immunofluorescence assays confirmed that VCP co-localized with non-structural replicase proteins but not with dsRNA foci possibly due to VCP epitope unavailability. VCP pro-viral role is also observed with other alphaviruses such as o\u2019nyong\u2019nyong virus (ONNV) and SFV in different human cell lines.

SETTING: A total of 26 dermatology and sexually transmitted disease (STD) departments, 34 obstetrics-gynaecology clinics and 28 urology outpatient clinics selected from 34 hospitals of Shenzhen regarded as our study sites. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2754 participants were recruited in this study, and 2534 participants completed the questionnaire survey and provided genital tract secretion specimens. There were 1106 male and 1428 female participants. Eligible participants were patients who presented for outpatient STD care at the selected clinics for the first time in October 2012 were at least 18 years old, and were able to give informed consent. OUTCOME MEASURES: Untested rate, true-positive rate, false-negative rate and unreported rate of gonorrhoea, as well as reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio and true diagnosis sex ratio were calculated and used to describe the results. RESULTS: 2534 participants were enrolled in the study. The untested rate of gonorrhoea among females was significantly higher than that among males (female 88.1%, male 68.3%, p=0.001). The male-to-female sex ratios of untested rate, true-positive rate, false-negative rate and unreported rate were 1:1.3, 1.2:1, 1:1.6 and 1:1.4, respectively. The reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio of new diagnosed gonorrhoea was 19.8:1 (male vs female: 87/1106 vs 5/1420), while the true diagnosis sex ratio was 2.5:1 (male vs female: 161/1106 vs 84/1420). These data indicate that the sex ratio of reported gonorrhoea incidence has been overestimated by a factor of 7.9 (19.8/2.5). CONCLUSIONS: We found the current reported gonorrhoea incidence and sex ratios to be inaccurate due to underestimations of gonorrhoea incidence, especially among women.","publish_time":"2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Mingzhou; Lan, Lina; Feng, Tiejian; Zhao, Guanglu; Wang, Feng; Hong, Fuchang; Wu, Xiaobing; Zhang, Chunlai; Wen, Lizhang; Liu, Aizhong; Best, John McCulloch; Tang, Weiming","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/036a7af6f90c822210bcac1869a5e85303bb0ef6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4800114.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26975933/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009629","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shenzhen"],"keyphrases":["untested rate of gonorrhoea","unreported rate of gonorrhoea","sex ratio of reported gonorrhoea incidence","true diagnosis rate","reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio of new diagnosed gonorrhoea","true diagnosis sex ratio","true-positive rate","underestimations of gonorrhoea incidence","female sex ratios of untested rate","reported incidence","current reported gonorrhoea incidence","female participants","difference of sex ratio","false-negative rate","male vs female","clinical process of gonorrhoea diagnosis","reference tests of gonorrhoea","Eligible participants","selected clinics","urology outpatient clinics","total","study sites","results","obstetrics-gynaecology clinics","outpatient STD care","reporting data","departments","questionnaire survey","dermatology","patients","genital tract secretion specimens","transmitted disease","hospitals of Shenzhen","China","OUTCOME MEASURES","females","years old","informed consent","OBJECTIVE","SETTING","CONCLUSIONS","time","women","factor"],"language":"en"},

Few studies so far have critically reviewed about medical responses to disasters and little information exists pertaining to the initiatives being undertaken by health sector from the perspective of basic disaster management cycle. This article aimed to review emergency health responses to disasters and other related interventions which have been undertaken in the health sector. Methods: Relevant documents were identified by searches in the websites of different sectors in Ethiopian and international non-governmental organizations and United Nations agencies. Using selected keywords, articles were also searched in the data bases of Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and Google Scholar. In addition, pertinent articles from non-indexed journals were referred to. Results: Disaster management system in Ethiopia focused on response, recovery, and rehabilitation from 1974 to 1988; while the period between 1988 and 1993 marked the transition phase towards a more comprehensive approach. Theoretically, from 1993 onwards, the disaster management system has fully integrated the mitigation, prevention, and preparedness phases into already existing response and recovery approach, particularly for drought. This policy has changed the emergency response practices and the health sector has taken some initiatives in the area of emergency health care. Hence, drought early warning system, therapeutic feeding program in hospitals, health centers and posts in drought prone areas to manage promptly acute malnutrition cases have all been put in place. In addition, public health disease emergencies have been responded to at all levels of health care system. Conclusions: Emergency health responses to drought and its ramifications such as acute malnutrition and epidemics have become more comprehensive in the context of basic disaster management phases; and impacts of drought and epidemics seem to be declining. However, the remaining challenge is to address disasters arising from other hazards such as flooding in terms of mitigation, prevention, preparedness and integrating them in the health care system.

Importantly, the work also identifies a number of approaches to exploit this understanding for therapeutic treatment and the data clearly illustrate the importance of NSP16 2\u2032O-MTase activity for CoV infection and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menachery, Vineet D.; Debbink, Kari; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a381459a5a244a3d0f75b97fd10c52d8aceef33.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5e9dd0eb2722df7090897bc78220afb8b09d7f38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4260984.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003967; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003967; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278144/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV infection","MERS-CoV","importance of NSP16","therapeutic treatment","O-MTase activity","importance of understanding","attenuation of NSP16 mutants","O-methyl","role of NSP16","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","host immune response","specific immune knockouts","review highlights conserved motifs","restoration","SARS","interaction partners","decade","data","emergent CoVs","pathogenesis","transferase","number of approaches","work","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

Already in the past, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 demonstrates the potential of coronaviruses to cross-species borders and further underlines the importance of identifying new-targeted drugs. An ideal antiviral agent should target essential proteins involved in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV. Currently, some HIV protease inhibitors (i.e., Lopinavir) are proposed for the treatment of COVID-19, although their effectiveness has not yet been assessed. The main protease (Mpr) provides a highly validated pharmacological target for the discovery and design of inhibitors. We identified potent Mpr inhibitors employing computational techniques that entail the screening of a Marine Natural Product (MNP) library. MNP library was screened by a hyphenated pharmacophore model, and molecular docking approaches. Molecular dynamics and re-docking further confirmed the results obtained by structure-based techniques and allowed this study to highlight some crucial aspects. Seventeen potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpr inhibitors have been identified among the natural substances of marine origin. As these compounds were extensively validated by a consensus approach and by molecular dynamics, the likelihood that at least one of these compounds could be bioactive is excellent.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gentile, Davide; Patamia, Vincenzo; Scala, Angela; Sciortino, Maria Teresa; Piperno, Anna; Rescifina, Antonio","journal":"Marine drugs","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/md18040225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340389/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mpr","Marine Natural Product","MNP"],"locations":["Middle Eastern"],"keyphrases":["potential SARS-CoV","potent Mpr inhibitors","lifecycle of SARS","Molecular dynamics","design of inhibitors","HIV protease inhibitors","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome","molecular docking approaches","MNP library","compounds","Marine Natural Product","validated pharmacological target","computational techniques","re-docking","natural substances of marine origin","potential of coronaviruses","treatment of COVID","main protease","structure-based techniques","new-targeted drugs","hyphenated pharmacophore model","essential proteins","results","screening","discovery","MERS","great concern","global public health","ideal antiviral agent","worldwide spread","study","importance","Lopinavir","consensus approach","current emergency","species","past","likelihood","crucial aspects","effectiveness"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we evaluated the protective effect of Fructus Gardeniae iridoid glycoside extracts (IGEs) against IAV by cytopathogenic effect(CPE), MTT and a plaque formation assay in vitro and examined the reduction in the pulmonary index (PI), restoration of body weight, reduction in mortality and increases in survival time in vivo. As a host factor, PACT provides protection against the pathogenic influenza A virus by interacting with IAV polymerase and activating the IFN-I response. To verify the whether IGEs suppress IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner, IAV RNA replication, expression of PACT and the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1 in A549 cells were detected; the levels of IFN\u03B2, PACT and PKR in mouse lung tissues were determined; and the activity of IAV polymerase was evaluated in PACT-compromised cells. The results indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protecting mice from IAV-induced injury and lethal IAV infection. These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between IVA polymerase and PACT and/or prevention of a PACT-dependent overactivated IFN-I antiviral response. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the mechanisms by which IGEs fight the influenza A virus in a PACT-dependent manner.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Shanshan; Bao, Lei; Li, Chun; Sun, Jing; Zhao, Ronghua; Cui, Xiaolan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/197489ce2e74e5566e1cd13fdce4a26b4eba45f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7002373.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-58443-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024921/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["J.

Recent developments in imaging and inhibition of entry pathways have provided insights into the ill-defined entry mechanism of HCV, bringing it to the forefront of viral entry research.

METHODS: The Korea reported its first laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus on May 20, 2015. Since the first indexed case, Korean public health authorities enforced many public health measures that were not authorized in the law; the scope of the current law was too limited to cover MERS. Korea has three levels of government: the central government, special self-governing provinces, and si/gun/gu. Unfortunately, the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act does not designate the specific roles of each level of government, and does not state how these governmental branches should be vertically integrated in a state of emergency. RESULTS: When thinking about these policy questions, we should be especially concerned about introducing a new act that deals with all matters relevant to emerging infectious diseases. The aim would be to develop a structure that specifies the roles of each level of government, and facilitates the close collaboration among them, then enacting this in law for the prevention and response of infectious disease. CONCLUSIONS: To address this problem, after analyzing the national healthcare infrastructure along with the characteristics of emerging infectious diseases, we propose the revision of the relevant law(s) in terms of governance aspects, emergency medical countermeasure aspects, and the human rights aspect.","publish_time":"2017-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Mijeong","journal":"Epidemiol Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf47b85324ae854a471893563d2156f4a47632e9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9d689209d9886db326dc65759ef929ac56832d93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5675986.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28774161/; https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2017033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["level of government","relevant law","central government","levels of government","response of infectious disease","improvement of law","current law","global infectious disease control","public health emergency situations","characteristics of emerging infectious diseases","state of emergency","public health measures","Korean public health authorities","revised Korean government legislation","Prevention Act","MERS","aim","emergency medical countermeasure aspects","indexed case","matters relevant","specific roles","new act","terms of governance aspects","case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","special self-governing provinces","realistic interpretations","applications","study","revision","gun","national healthcare infrastructure","coronavirus","human rights aspect","laboratory","problem","scope","OBJECTIVES","close collaboration","policy questions","governmental branches","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Within the 3\u2032 terminal 3.5 kb of the PRRSV genome, six overlapping reading frames (ORFs) were identified, each most likely expressed by one of the subgenomic mRNAs. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that the most 3\u2032 terminal ORF (ORF7) encodes the PRRSV nucleocapsid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 14 kDa. It displays 44.8% amino acid identity with the capsid protein of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and 23.6% with that of equine arteritis virus (EAV). The product of ORF6, the second 3\u2032 terminal ORF, represents a putative membrane protein and exhibits 53.2 and 27.2% amino acid identity with the corresponding LDV and EAV polypeptides, respectively. Similar to EAV, ORFs 2 through 5 might encode glycosylated viral proteins. The polypeptide deduced from the most 5\u2032 ORF (ORF1b) contains two conserved domains common to EAV and coronavirus polymerases.

Similarly, antibodies used to prevent or treat viral infections attach to epitopes on virions or on viral proteins expressed on the surface of infected cells. Such drugs and antibodies can therefore be thought of as probes for the detection of viral infections, suggesting that they might be used as radiolabeled tracers to visualize sites of viral replication by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. A current example of this approach is the PET imaging of herpes simplex virus infections, in which the viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates radiolabeled thymidine analogues, trapping them within infected cells. One of many possible future applications might be the use of a radiolabeled hepatitis C protease inhibitor to image infection in animals or humans and provide a quantitative measure of viral burden. This article reviews the basic features of radionuclide imaging and the characteristics of ideal tracer molecules, and discusses how antiviral drugs and antibodies could be evaluated for their suitability as virus-specific imaging probes. The use of labeled drugs as low-dose tracers would provide an alternative application for compounds that have failed to advance to clinical use because of insufficient in vivo potency, an unsuitable pharmacokinetic profile or hepato- or nephrotoxicity.","publish_time":"2010-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bray, Mike; Di Mascio, Michele; de Kok-Mercado, Fabian; Mollura, Daniel J.; Jagoda, Elaine","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04cc401cd690845724a7b04a11fcb11f2e70c96c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125728.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2010.08.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354210006923; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354210006923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20709111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteins","viral enzyme","detection of viral infections","sites of viral replication","viral thymidine kinase","quantitative measure of viral burden","antibodies","use of labeled drugs","radiolabeled tracers","molecule drugs","antiviral drugs","virus-specific imaging probes","PET imaging of herpes simplex virus infections","radiolabeled thymidine analogues","clinical use","basic features of radionuclide imaging","positron emission tomography","surface of infected cells","single-photon emission computed tomography","radiolabeled hepatitis C protease inhibitor","virion structural proteins","low-dose tracers","image infection","SPECT","binding","animals","potency","unsuitable pharmacokinetic profile","active site","characteristics of ideal tracer molecules","humans","approach","suitability","epitopes","virions","hepato","alternative application","number of small","nephrotoxicity","article","possible future applications","downstream process","current example","compounds"],"language":"en"},

Along with basic understanding of germ theory and sanitation, vaccination, over the past 50 years, has transformed lives and economies in both rich and poor countries by its direct impact on human and animal life\u2014resulting in the eradication of small pox, huge reductions in the burden of previously common human and animal diseases such as polio, typhoid, measles in human medicine and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, screwworm and hog cholera and the verge of eradicating brucellosis, tuberculosis, and pseudorabies in veterinary medicine. In addition vaccination along with other animal production changes has provided the ability to produce otherwise unaffordable animal protein and animal health worldwide. The landscape however on which vaccinology was discovered and applied over the past 200 years, even in the past 10 years has and is undergoing continuous change. For vaccination as a public health tool to have its greatest impacts in human and veterinary medicine, these great medical sciences will have to come together, policy-relevant science for sustainable conservation in developing and developed countries needs to become the norm and address poverty (including lack of basic health care) in communities affected by conservation, and to consider costs and benefits (perceived or not) affecting the well-being of all stakeholders, from the local to the multinational. The need to return to and/or develop new education-based models for turning the tide from the heavily return-on-investment therapeutic era of the last century into one where the investment into the preventative sciences and medicine lead to sustainable cultural and cost-effective public health and economic changes of the future is never more evident than today. The new complex problems of the new millennium will require new educational models that train para- and professional people for thinking and solving complex inter-related biological, ecological, public-, political/economic problems. The single profession that is best positioned to impact vaccinology is Veterinary Medicine. It\u2019s melding with human medicine and their role in future comparative and conservation-based programs will be critical to the successful application of vaccines into the 21st century.","publish_time":"2008-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nara, Peter L.; Nara, DeAnna; Chaudhuri, Ray; Lin, George; Tobin, Greg","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1e09c7e9de97c71b670d0a1db786ba24a1216bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130711.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.07.094; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X08010268; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X08010268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18708109/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Veterinary Medicine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human medicine","veterinary medicine","animal health","cost-effective public health","animal diseases","animal life","safest forms of medicine","years","public health tool","animal production changes","new complex problems","sustainable conservation","new millennium","addition vaccination","Abstract Vaccination","unaffordable animal protein","new educational models","new education-based models","lack of basic health care","conservation-based programs","economic changes","economic problems","century","vaccinology","future comparative","poor countries","developed countries","direct impact","preventative sciences","great medical sciences","investment therapeutic era","basic understanding of germ theory","hog cholera","greatest impacts","foot","tuberculosis","burden","sanitation","contagious bovine pleuropneumonia","measles","ability","polio","typhoid","verge of eradicating brucellosis","huge reductions","mouth disease","screwworm","eradication of small pox","norm","economies","pseudorabies","role","address poverty","successful application of vaccines","professional people","policy-relevant science","lives","communities","stakeholders","costs","continuous change","tide","single profession","well-being","multinational","benefits","landscape","need"],"language":"en"},

Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively.

These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores \u2212725.0 Kcal/mole and \u2212786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also.

In this study, we conducted a survey of CaKoV at small animal hospitals in Bangkok and vicinity of Thailand during September 2016 to September 2018. RESULTS: Three hundred and seven rectal swab samples were collected from healthy dogs (n = 55) and dogs with gastroenteritis symptoms (n = 252). Of 307 swab samples tested by using one-step RT-PCR specific to 3D gene, we found CaKoV positivity at 17.59% (54/307). CaKoVs could be detected in both sick (19.44%) and healthy (9.09%) animals. In relation to age group, CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs (25.45%). Our result showed no seasonal pattern of CaKoV infection in domestic dogs. In this study, we characterized CaKoVs by whole genome sequencing (n = 4) or 3D and VP1 gene sequencing (n = 8). Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that whole genomes of Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs with highest 99.5% amino acid identity suggesting possible origin of CaKoVs in Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study was the first to report the detection and genetic characteristics of CaKoVs in domestic dogs in Thailand. CaKoVs could be detected in both sick and healthy dogs. The virus is frequently detected in younger dogs. Thai CaKoVs were genetically closely related and grouped with Chinese CaKoVs. Our result raises the concerns to vet practitioners that diarrhea in dogs due to canine Kobuvirus infection should not be ignored.

Consequently evidence-based decision-making, data management guidelines, health resourcing for primary health care services and prevention strategies are lacking. This study aims to comprehensively describe the epidemiology, impact and outcomes of ARI in urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (hereafter referred to as Indigenous) in the greater Brisbane area. METHODS/DESIGN: An ongoing prospective cohort study of Indigenous children aged less than five years registered with a primary health care service in Northern Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Children are recruited at time of presentation to the service for any reason. Demographic, epidemiological, risk factor, microbiological, economic and clinical data are collected at enrolment. Enrolled children are followed for 12 months during which time ARI events, changes in child characteristics over time and monthly nasal swabs are collected. Children who develop an ARI with cough as a symptom during the study period are more intensely followed-up for 28 (\u00B13) days including weekly nasal swabs and parent completed cough diary cards. Children with persistent cough at day 28 post-ARI are reviewed by a paediatrician. DISCUSSION: Our study will be one of the first to comprehensively evaluate the natural history, epidemiology, aetiology, economic impact and outcomes of ARIs in this population. The results will inform studies for the development of evidence-based guidelines to improve the early detection, prevention and management of chronic cough and setting of priorities in children during and after ARI.

In most cats, FHV remains latent after recovery, and they become lifelong virus carriers. Stress or corticosteroid treatment may lead to virus reactivation and shedding in oronasal and conjunctival secretions. Infection Sick cats shed FHV in oral, nasal and conjunctival secretions; shedding may last for 3 weeks. Infection requires direct contact with a shedding cat. Disease signs Feline herpesvirus infections cause acute rhinitis and conjunctivitis, usually accompanied by fever, depression and anorexia. Affected cats may also develop typical ulcerative, dendritic keratitis. Diagnosis Samples consist of conjunctival, corneal or oropharyngeal swabs, corneal scrapings or biopsies. It is not recommended that cats recently vaccinated with a modified-live virus vaccine are sampled. Positive PCR results should be interpreted with caution, as they may be produced by low-level shedding or viral latency. Disease management \u2018Tender loving care\u2019 from the owner, supportive therapy and good nursing are essential. Anorexic cats should be fed blended, highly palatable food \u2013 warmed up if required. Mucolytic drugs (eg, bromhexine) or nebulisation with saline may offer relief. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Topical antiviral drugs may be used for the treatment of acute FHV ocular disease. The virus is labile and susceptible to most disinfectants, antiseptics and detergents. Vaccination recommendations Two injections, at 9 and 12 weeks of age, are recommended, with a first booster 1 year later. Boosters should be given annually to at-risk cats. For cats in low-risk situations (eg, indoor-only cats), 3-yearly intervals suffice. Cats that have recovered from FHV-associated disease are usually not protected for life against further disease episodes; vaccination of recovered cats is therefore recommended.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thiry, Etienne; Addie, Diane; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Hosie, Margaret J.; Lloret, Albert; Lutz, Hans; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D.; Truyen, Uwe; Horzinek, Marian C.","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55f956cd4330127bebfb5e25f820f8e85a566a02.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X09001156; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X09001156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["at-risk cats","Anorexic cats","vaccination of recovered cats","FHV-associated disease","Infection Sick cats","disease episodes","Disease management","treatment of acute FHV ocular disease","Disease signs Feline herpesvirus infections","feline calicivirus","conjunctival secretions","virus reactivation","shedding cat","low-level shedding","upper respiratory tract disease","lifelong virus carriers","Abstract Overview Feline viral rhinotracheitis","modified-live virus vaccine","corneal scrapings","acute rhinitis","corticosteroid treatment","viral latency","Vaccination recommendations","Mucolytic drugs","weeks of age","secondary bacterial infections","Topical antiviral drugs","owner","oropharyngeal swabs","supportive therapy","Tender loving care","good nursing","conjunctivitis","recovery","disinfectants","bromhexine","biopsies","direct contact","oronasal","low-risk situations","nebulisation","saline","fever","antiseptics","dendritic keratitis","injections","Diagnosis Samples","Positive PCR results","depression","anorexia","caution","relief","palatable food","detergents","Stress","yearly intervals","Broad-spectrum antibiotics","Boosters"],"language":"en"},

Then, we study the relationship between the epidemic rate and synchronization stability of these models and, in particular, obtain the conditions of local and global stability for epidemic synchronization. Finally, we perform numerical analysis to verify our theoretical results.

Interferons (IFN) provide a first line of host defense when cells detect an invading organism. Whereas type I IFN were discovered almost 60 years ago, type III IFN were only identified in the early 2000s. It was initially thought that type I IFN and type III IFN performed largely redundant functions. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that type III IFN exert distinct and non-redundant functions compared to type I IFN, especially in mucosal tissues. Here, we review recent progress made in unraveling the role of type I/III IFN in intestinal mucosal tissue in the steady state, in response to mucosal pathogens and during inflammation.","publish_time":"2017-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pott, Johanna; Stockinger, Silvia","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fac028a97db9169282fd01c3ca41d4eb7afb3f5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5348535.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28352268/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00258","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN","role of type","mucosal pathogens","intestinal mucosal tissue","mucosal tissues","mucosal immune system","non-redundant functions","colonized intestinal lumen","dangerous pathogens","steady state","harmless antigens","outside word","cells","water uptake","barrier","active interface","response","line of host defense","tight balance","invading organism","time acts","food","commensals","inflammation","years","recent progress","Interferons"],"language":"en"},

The impact of locally produced disinfectant with operational training as a means to improve hygiene in resource-limited healthcare facilities and prevent HAI was evaluated. METHOD: In Burkina Faso, 4 types of electro-chlorinator devices that convert salt and water into sodium hypochlorite through electrolysis were installed in 26 healthcare facilities distributed across 3 sanitary districts. The program was evaluated at 4 months and 11 months and performance compared with a control group. RESULTS: After 11 months, over 90% of the facilities applied 8 of the 11 essential hygiene practices defined by the Ministry of Health, compared to 20% in the control group. 61.5% of the healthcare facilities improved the chlorine concentration of their sodium hypochlorite solutions, reaching an average concentration of 5.1 g/L compared to an average of 2.1 g/L in the control group. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis demonstrated that locally produced sodium hypochlorite led to daily savings ranging between 2.7 and 53 euros depending on the device compared with the purchase of chlorine tablets. CONCLUSION: Results, therefore, suggest that electro-chlorinator devices in addition to hygiene sensitization can be a simple, cost-effective and tailored intervention to reduce the prevalence of HAI in low-resource settings.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duvernay, Pierre-Gilles; de Laguiche, Elisabeth; Nogueira, Renata Campos; Graz, Bertrand; Nana, Louis; Ou\u00E9draogo, Wilfrid; Sauter, Yannick; Sauvageat, Eric","journal":"Infect Dis Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf03a01d651838b197a688303a2e9deabb499306.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211687.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468045120300250; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468045120300250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417112/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2020.04.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAI","the Ministry of Health"],"locations":["Burkina Faso"],"keyphrases":["months","control group","resource-limited healthcare facilities","produced sodium hypochlorite","sodium hypochlorite solutions","hygiene sensitization","chlorine concentration","healthcare-associated infections","average concentration","prevalence of HAI","RESULTS","types of electro-chlorinator devices","essential hygiene practices","produced disinfectant","low-resource settings","purchase of chlorine tablets","water","salt","operational training","contamination of surfaces","means","addition","electrolysis","tailored intervention","Burkina Faso","daily savings","performance","cost-benefit analysis","Nosocomial pathogens","Ministry of Health","impact","sanitary districts","BACKGROUND","euros","METHOD","CONCLUSION","program"],"language":"en"},

Because it is difficult to obtain regulatory approval of vaccine based on live viruses, we constructed a replication-defective single-cycle VSV vector in which we replaced the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene with the SARS-CoV S gene. The virus was only able to infect cells when pseudotyped with the VSV G protein. We measured the effectiveness of immunization with the single-cycle vaccine in mice. We found that the vaccine given intramuscularly induced a neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV that was approximately ten-fold greater than that required for the protection from SARS-CoV infection, and significantly greater than that generated by the replication-competent vector expressing SARS-CoV S protein given by the same route.

As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration. Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever, and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys. Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19 disease, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call upon our clinical skills and judgment. These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context. Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios. We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously. But act today we must, and understanding the multiplicity of mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19 infection will help us meet our mission unsupported by the comfort of strong data.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Libby, Peter","journal":"JACC Basic Transl Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6eefd34cd7466463ab20f15d56ff5ef6e9a7bcc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452302X20301546?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452302X20301546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292847/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["myocardial injury","current COVID","acute infection","hospitalized patients","ill patients","virulent viral infection","direct viral infection","biomarker of cardiac injury","immense challenge of COVID","Cytokines","robust evidence base","thrombotic risk","activation of cells","increased oxygen","current context","choices of therapy","rigorous evidence","microvascular activation","clinical skills","reduced oxygen delivery","risk of ischemic syndromes","individual clinical scenarios","present enormous logistical challenges","invasive procedures","pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions","hypotension","advanced imaging","interpretation","actionability","pathophysiologic reasoning","tachycardia","fever","dire straits","disease","hypoxemia","organ systems","extreme humility","mission unsupported","cardiovascular complications","Fulminant myocarditis","harm","comfort of strong data","multiplicity of mechanisms","plausible interventions","careful consideration","troponin","throes","caution","judgment","infections","kidneys","pandemic","Summary","touchstones"],"language":"en"},

Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), including porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, is a worldwide swine disease. To date, little is known concerning the relationship between OTA and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), the primary causative agent of PCVAD. The effects of OTA on PCV2 replication and their mechanisms were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results in vitro showed that low doses of OTA significantly increased PCV2 DNA copies and the number of infected cells. Maximum effects were observed at 0.05\u03BCg/ml OTA. The results in vivo showed that PCV2 replication was significantly increased in serum and tissues of pigs fed 75\u03BCg/kg OTA compared with the control group and pigs fed 150\u03BCg/kg OTA. In addition, low doses of OTA significantly depleted reduced glutathione and mRNA expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 and \u03B3-glutamylcysteine synthetase; increased reactive oxygen species, oxidants, and malondialdehyde; and induced p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PK15 cells. Adding N-acetyl-l-cysteine reversed the changes induced by OTA. Knockdown of p38 and ERK1/2 by their respective specific siRNAs or inhibition of p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by their respective inhibitors (SB203580 and U0126) eliminated the increase in PCV2 replication induced by OTA. These data indicate that low doses of OTA promoted PCV2 replication in vitro and in vivo via the oxidative stress-mediated p38/ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway. This suggests that low doses of OTA are potentially harmful to animals, as they enhance virus replication, and partly explains why the morbidity and severity of PCVAD vary significantly in different pig farms.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gan, Fang; Zhang, Zheqian; Hu, Zhihua; Hesketh, John; Xue, Hongxia; Chen, Xingxiang; Hao, Shu; Huang, Yu; Cole Ezea, Patience; Parveen, Fahmida; Huang, Kehe","journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a95bfe3435012b271cf3e44a1b3ee82d34e1c64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126689.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.12.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542137/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891584914014245; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584914014245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of OTA","low doses of OTA","PCV2 replication","ERK1","induced p38","\u03BCg","virus replication","increased PCV2 DNA copies","inhibition of p38","Knockdown of p38","phosphorylation","porcine circovirus type","porcine dermatitis","severity of PCVAD","Porcine circovirus-associated disease","animals","results","oxidative stress-mediated p38","worldwide swine disease","respective inhibitors","primary causative agent of PCVAD","worldwide mycotoxin","tissues of pigs","PK15 cells","Maximum effects","respective specific siRNAs","number of infected cells","\u03B3-glutamylcysteine synthetase","mRNA expression of NF","reduced glutathione","reactive oxygen species","E2-related factor","malondialdehyde","nephropathy syndrome","feeds","oxidants","SB203580","U0126","potent nephrotoxin","food","MAPK","control group","relationship","serum","different pig farms","humans","addition","data","mechanisms","N-acetyl","morbidity","pathway","Abstract Ochratoxin","changes","date"],"language":"en"},

Molecular diagnostic assays to amplify specific nucleic acids are available for each of these agents. If positive molecular diagnostic assay results are common after vaccination, the positive predictive value of the diagnostic assays for disease would be decreased. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of administration of commercially available modified live topical adenovirus 2, B. bronchiseptica, and parainfluenza vaccine has on the results of a commercially available PCR panel. ANIMALS: Eight puppies from a research breeding facility negative for these pathogens. METHODS: Blinded prospective pilot study. Puppies were vaccinated with a single dose of modified live topical adenovirus 2, B. bronchiseptica, and parainfluenza and parenteral dose of adenovirus 2, canine distemper virus, and parvovirus. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected on multiple days and submitted for PCR assay. RESULTS: Nucleic acids of all 3 organisms contained in the topical vaccine were detected from both samples multiple times through 28 days after vaccination with higher numbers of positive samples detected between days 3 and 10 after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Vaccine status should be considered when interpreting respiratory agent PCR results if modified live vaccines have been used. Development of quantitative PCR and wild\u2010type sequencing are necessary to improve positive predictive value of these assays by distinguishing vaccinate from natural infection.","publish_time":"2015-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruch\u2010Gallie, R.; Moroff, S.; Lappin, M.R.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12267e4378cb6c21255f204fb40b9daaa02ab09b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4913651.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26692461/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.13821","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parainfluenza vaccine","topical adenovirus","topical vaccine","modified live intranasal vaccine available","vaccination","positive molecular diagnostic assay results","Canine adenovirus","PCR assay","available PCR panel","respiratory agent PCR results","positive predictive value","Molecular diagnostic assays","multiple days","Vaccine status","live vaccines","parenteral dose of adenovirus","higher numbers of positive samples","Development of quantitative PCR","puppies","Bordetella bronchiseptica cause respiratory disease","samples multiple times","specific nucleic acids","single dose","canine distemper virus","type sequencing","dogs","research breeding facility negative","distinguishing","METHODS","Blinded prospective pilot study","pathogens","CONCLUSIONS","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","pharyngeal swabs","organisms","parvovirus","natural infection","impact of administration","BACKGROUND","ANIMALS","OBJECTIVE","agents"],"language":"en"},

Anxiety developed in the general public and physicians faced a huge challenge in many aspects. We conducted this prospective study to develop a scoring system based on the clinical manifestations for predicting the results of influenza rapid testing, as a surrogate of influenza rapid testing, to lower the anxiety and decrease the burden for the test. Methods From September 1, 2009 to October 5, 2009, pediatric patients who received influenza rapid tests were enrolled, and questionnaires were recorded and analyzed in the first 2 weeks. A further scoring system was conducted to predict the results of influenza rapid tests and validated in the next 3 weeks. Results Eight hundred and forty-five children were enrolled in our study. In the first phase, data from 506 patients showed that those with age \u2265 5 years, fever \u2265 38\u00B0C, contact history of influenza A infection, myalgia, lethargy, sore throat, cough, and headache had a higher risk of positive results (odds ratio: 1.1\u20132.53). A scoring system was designed, with \u22655 points indicating acceptable sensitivity (69.5%) and specificity (63.6%). Three hundred and thirty-nine patients in the second phase were enrolled to validate the scoring system and the positive and negative predictive values were 52.0% and 73.8%. Conclusion The emergence of H1N1v infection is not only an important medical issue, but also a socioeconomic problem. Based on easily available clinical information, we develop a scoring system as a preliminary screening tool for the general public and first-line health care providers to evaluate the possibility of influenza virus infection. Although this study was limited by the sensitivity of rapid tests, this type of model may be a surrogate weapon when faced with overwhelming pandemic infection in the future, especially in areas with scarce medical resources.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Chien-Yu; Chi, Hsin; Lin, Hsiang-Yu; Chang, Lung; Hou, Jen-Yin; Huang, Ching-Ting; Lee, Hung-Chang; Chen, Ming-Ren; Peng, Chun-Chih; Tsung-Ning Huang, Daniel; Chiu, Nan-Chang","journal":"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04350826dbcbaf1c4e8005c063657da22593a210.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105037.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22177368/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2011.11.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118211002350; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118211002350","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["results of influenza rapid tests","scoring system","results of influenza rapid testing","history of influenza","possibility of influenza virus infection","surrogate of influenza rapid testing","sensitivity of rapid tests","pandemic novel influenza H1N1","overwhelming pandemic infection","emergence of H1N1v infection","large-scale community infection","general public","higher risk of positive results","pediatric patients","Anxiety","prospective study","phase","weeks","surrogate weapon","clinical manifestations","acceptable sensitivity","important medical issue","scarce medical resources","available clinical information","swine","headache","lethargy","myalgia","preliminary screening tool","sore throat","line health care providers","cough","future","type of model","huge challenge","odds ratio","areas","physicians","negative predictive values","years","fever","age","Taiwan","Conclusion","questionnaires","socioeconomic problem","aspects","burden","points","data","children","specificity","Methods"],"language":"en"},

IAVs cause a wide range of clinical illnesses, from relatively mild infections by seasonal strains, to acute respiratory distress during infections with highly pathogenic avian IAVs (HPAI). For this study, we infected A549 human lung cells with lab prototype A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8), a seasonal H1N1 (RV733), the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdm09), or with two avian strains, an H5N1 HPAI strain or an H7N9 strain that has low pathogenicity in birds but high pathogenicity in humans. We used a newly-developed aptamer-based multiplexed technique (SOMAscan(\u00AE)) to examine \u003E1300 human lung cell proteins affected by the different IAV strains, and identified more than 500 significantly dysregulated cellular proteins. Our analyses indicated that the avian strains induced more profound changes in the A549 global proteome compared to all tested low-pathogenicity H1N1 strains. The PR8 strain induced a general activation, primarily by upregulating many immune molecules, the seasonal RV733 and pdm09 strains had minimal effect upon assayed molecules, and the avian strains induced significant downregulation, primarily in antimicrobial response, cardiovascular and post-translational modification systems.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coombs, Kevin M.; Simon, Philippe F.; McLeish, Nigel J.; Zahedi-Amiri, Ali; Kobasa, Darwyn","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6893437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893437/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["seasonal strains","avian strains","pdm09 strains","seasonal H1N1","tested low-pathogenicity H1N1 strains","seasonal RV733","different IAV strains","pathogenic avian IAVs","low pathogenicity","seasonal epidemics","PR8 strain","pandemic H1N1","H7N9 strain","human emerging","A549 human lung cells","H5N1 HPAI strain","high pathogenicity","human lung cell proteins","mild infections","assayed molecules","immune molecules","cellular proteins","A549 global proteome","antimicrobial response","important animal","minimal effect","acute respiratory distress","re-emerging pathogens","lab prototype","profound changes","birds","post-translational modification systems","significant downregulation","wide range of clinical illnesses","viruses","sporadic pandemics","general activation","aptamer","multiplexed technique","SOMAscan","humans","study","Influenza","analyses"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurring in patients with severe ARDS under veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We tried to determine the frequency of Herpesviridae reactivation and its impact on patients\u2019 prognosis during ECMO for severe ARDS. RESULTS: During a 5-year period, 123 non-immunocompromised patients with a severe ARDS requiring a veno-venous ECMO were included. Sixty-seven patients (54%) experienced HSV and/or CMV reactivation during ECMO course (20 viral co-infection, 40 HSV alone, and 7 CMV alone). HSV reactivation occurred earlier than CMV after the beginning of MV [(6\u201315) vs. 19 (13\u201329) days; p \u003C 0.01] and after ECMO implementation [(2\u20138) vs. 14 (10\u201320) days; p \u003C 0.01]. In univariate analysis, HSV/CMV reactivation was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation [(22\u201352.5) vs. 17.5 (9\u201328) days; p \u003C 0.01], a longer duration of ECMO [15 (10\u201322.5) vs. 9 (5\u201314) days; p \u003C 0.01], and a prolonged ICU [29 (19.5\u201347.5) vs. 16 (9\u201330) days; p \u003C 0.01] and hospital stay [44 (29\u201363.5) vs. 24 (11\u201343) days; p \u003C 0.01] as compared to non-reactivated patients. However, in multivariate analysis, viral reactivation remained associated with prolonged MV only. When considered separately, both HSV and CMV reactivation were associated with a longer duration of MV as compared to non-reactivation patients [29 (19.5\u201341) and 28 (20.5\u201337), respectively, vs. 17.5 (9\u201328) days; p \u003C 0.05]. Co-reactivation patients had a longer duration of MV [58.5 (38\u201372.3); p \u003C 0.05] and ICU stay [51.5 (32.5\u201369) vs. 27.5 (17.75\u201335.5) and 29 (20\u201330.5), respectively] as compared to patients with HSV or CMV reactivation alone. In multivariate analysis, HSV reactivation remained independently associated with a longer duration of MV and hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Herpesviridae reactivation is frequent among patients with severe ARDS under veno-venous ECMO and is associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation. The direct causative link between HSV and CMV reactivation and respiratory function worsening under ECMO remains to be confirmed.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hraiech, Sami; Bonnardel, Eline; Guervilly, Christophe; Fabre, Cyprien; Loundou, Anderson; Forel, Jean-Marie; Adda, M\u00E9lanie; Parzy, Gabriel; Cavaille, Guilhem; Coiffard, Benjamin; Roch, Antoine; Papazian, Laurent","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17a2301f5673e08a8830da3081504b9791323de5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6928167.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozg00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ECMO","HSV","MV","HSV/CMV","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSV reactivation","CMV reactivation","non-reactivation patients","Co-reactivation patients","viral reactivation","days","longer duration of ECMO","frequency of Herpesviridae reactivation","longer duration of MV","non-immunocompromised patients","ill patients","experienced HSV","veno-venous ECMO","non-reactivated patients","severe ARDS","ECMO course","ECMO implementation","longer duration of mechanical ventilation","prolonged MV","beginning of MV","multivariate analysis","univariate analysis","hospital length of stay","prolonged ICU","veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","viral co-infection","patients\u2019 prognosis","impaired prognosis","respiratory function worsening","acute respiratory distress syndrome","impact","Cytomegalovirus","direct causative link","year period","BACKGROUND","herpes simplex virus","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A bolus of cold saline injected in a central vein travels through the heart and lung, but also the aorta until detection in a femoral artery. While it is well accepted that injection in the inferior vena cava results in higher values, the impact of the aortic volume on GEDV is unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that a larger aortic volume directly translates to a numerically higher GEDV measurement. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 88 critically ill patients with thermodilution monitoring and who did require a contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdominal computed tomography scan. Aortic volumes derived from imaging were compared with GEDV measurements in temporal proximity. RESULTS: Median aortic volume was 194 ml (interquartile range 147 to 249 ml). Per milliliter increase of the aortic volume, we found a GEDV increase by 3.0 ml (95% CI 2.0 to 4.1 ml, p \u003C 0.001). In case a femoral central venous line was used for saline bolus injection, GEDV raised additionally by 2.1 ml (95% CI 0.5 to 3.7 ml, p = 0.01) per ml volume of the vena cava inferior. Aortic volume explained 59.3% of the variance of thermodilution-derived GEDV. When aortic volume was included in multivariate regression, GEDV variance was unaffected by sex, age, body height, and weight. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the aortic volume is a substantial confounding variable for GEDV measurements performed with transpulmonary thermodilution. As the aorta is anatomically located after the heart, GEDV should not be considered to reflect cardiac preload. Guiding volume management by raw or indexed reference ranges of GEDV may be misleading.","publish_time":"2020-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akohov, Aleksej; Barner, Christoph; Grimmer, Steffen; Francis, Roland CE; Wolf, Stefan","journal":"Intensive Care Med Exp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/def41c08c3cb1b3752bcff34d3aed7f8486e1c86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6940405.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6940405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzEwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GEDV measurements","GEDV variance","derived GEDV","larger aortic volume","Median aortic volume","higher GEDV measurement","Aortic volumes","Guiding volume management","indexed reference ranges of GEDV","Global end-diastolic volume","variance of thermodilution","transpulmonary thermodilution","thermodilution monitoring","inferior vena cava results","vena cava inferior","saline bolus injection","heart","aorta","CI","bolus of cold saline","indicator of cardiac preload","higher values","femoral central venous line","femoral artery","central vein travels","substantial confounding variable","sex","multivariate regression","contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdominal computed tomography scan","impact","body height","ill patients","lung","case","BACKGROUND","imaging","data","weight","detection","temporal proximity","interquartile range","milliliter","METHODS","study","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"}]}

On 11 March 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. On 16 March 2020, there were 139 countries affected. In this situation, the Scientific Societies SEMICYUC and SEEIUC, have decided to draw up this Contingency Plan to guide the response of the Intensive Care Services. The objectives of this plan are to estimate the magnitude of the problem and identify the necessary human and material resources.

Additional viruses that were not identified by conventional virology assays were detected (4 human bocaviruses and 7 coronaviruses). Samples in which the RT-PCR/ESI-MS results disagreed with conventional virology were sent for analysis by a third method using a commercial RT-PCR-based assay, which can identify viruses not detectable by conventional virologic procedures.

RESULTS: In surviving cases, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels decreased significantly on admission as compared with the levels before infection; the LDL levels remained constantly low during the disease progression and resumed to the original levels when patients recovered (pre-infection: 3.5 (3.0\u20134.4); on admission: 2.8 (2.3\u20133.1), p \u003C 0.01; progression: 2.5 (2.3\u20133.0); discharge: 3.6 (2.7\u20134.1); median (IQR), in mmol/L).

The binding of hemagglutinin (HA) on the viral surface to host sialic acid (SA) receptors is a requisite step in the infection process. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that H5N1 viruses can be divided into 10 clades based on their HA sequences, with most human IVs centered from clade 1 and clade 2.1 to clade 2.3. Protein sequence alignment in various clades indicates the high conservation in the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) is essential for binding with the SA receptor. Two glycosylation sites, 158N and 169N, also participate in receptor recognition. In the present work, we attempted to construct a serial H5N1 HA models including diverse glycosylated HAs to simulate the binding process with various SA receptors in silico. As the SA-\u03B1-2,3-Gal and SA-\u03B1-2,6-Gal receptor adopted two distinctive topologies, straight and fishhook-like, respectively, the presence of N-glycans at 158N would decrease the affinity of HA for all of the receptors, particularly SA-\u03B1-2,6-Gal analogs. The steric clashes of the huge glycans shown at another glycosylation site, 169N, located on an adjacent HA monomer, would be more effective in preventing the binding of SA-\u03B1-2,3-Gal analogs.","publish_time":"2012-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wentian; Sun, Shisheng; Li, Zheng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d12d0dd222c803e8a4e4f3e516d5feecd103358.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3375263.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0038794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22719948/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North Africa"],"keyphrases":["binding of SA","SA-\u03B1","various SA receptors","Gal receptor","binding process","receptor-binding domains","HA sequences","binding of hemagglutinin","affinity of HA","presence of N","Gal analogs","H5N1 viruses","serial H5N1 HA models","receptor recognition","adjacent HA monomer","human IVs","various clades","numbers of H5N1 influenza viruses","human deaths","huge glycans","infection process","glycosylation sites","high conservation","North Africa","viral surface","distinctive topologies","sialic acid","requisite step","RBDs","Protein sequence alignment","silico","fishhook","steric clashes","Phylogenetic analysis","present work"],"language":"en"},

Patients infected with influenza A(H7N9) virus present with acute lung injury (ALI) that is due to severe pneumonia and systemic inflammation. It is often fatal because there are few effective treatment options. Complement activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of virus-induced lung injury; therefore, we investigated the effect of targeted complement inhibition on ALI induced by H7N9 virus infection. Methods. A novel neutralizing specific antihuman C5a antibody (IFX-1) was used. This antibody blocked the ability of C5a to induce granulocytes to express CD11b while not affecting the ability of C5b to form the membrane attack complex. African green monkeys were inoculated with H7N9 virus and treated intravenously with IFX-1. Results. The virus infection led to intense ALI and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in association with excessive complement activation. Anti-C5a treatment in H7N9-infected monkeys substantially attenuated ALI: It markedly reduced the lung histopathological injury and decreased the lung infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. Moreover, the treatment decreased the intensity of SIRS; the body temperature changes were minimal and the plasma levels of inflammatory mediators were markedly reduced. The treatments also significantly decreased the virus titers in the infected lungs. Conclusions. Antihuman C5a antibody treatment remarkably reduced the ALI and systemic inflammation induced by H7N9 virus infection. Complement inhibition may be a promising adjunctive therapy for severe viral pneumonia.","publish_time":"2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Shihui; Zhao, Guangyu; Liu, Chenfeng; Fan, Wei; Zhou, Xiaojun; Zeng, Lin; Guo, Yan; Kou, Zhihua; Yu, Hong; Li, Junfeng; Wang, Renxi; Li, Yan; Schneider, Conny; Habel, Maria; Riedemann, Niels C.; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo; Guo, Renfeng; Zhou, Yusen","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7d1aa453c98881cc2669c24d623ae1365c22191.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112341.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciu887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25433014/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI","Antihuman"],"organizations":["SIRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H7N9 virus infection","virus present","pathogenesis of virus","virus titers","H7N9-infected monkeys","induced lung injury","Antihuman C5a antibody treatment","intense ALI","ability of C5a","Anti-C5a treatment","acute lung injury","lung histopathological injury","systemic inflammation","excessive complement activation","novel neutralizing specific antihuman C5a antibody","lung infiltration of macrophages","severe pneumonia","IFX","effective treatment options","effect of targeted complement inhibition","infected lungs","systemic inflammatory response syndrome","severe viral pneumonia","intensity of SIRS","ability of C5b","African green monkeys","plasma levels of inflammatory mediators","promising adjunctive therapy","association","body temperature changes","granulocytes","express CD11b","influenza","membrane attack complex","neutrophils","Patients","treatments","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, it just took one week to construct the recombinant PEDV rAJ1102-\u0394ORF3-EGFP using this method, providing a more efficient platform for PEDV genome manipulation, which could also be applied to other RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Qi; Fang, Liurong; Ding, Zhen; Wang, Dang; Peng, Guiqing; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/661dbf3aaf3b32f2f8514e5c51d6bc4999667643.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113866.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31712093/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093419301119; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113772; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093419301119","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant PEDV rAJ1102-\u0394ORF3","recombinant virus rAJ1102-\u0394ORF3","parental rAJ1102","EGFP gene","virulent PEDV strain AJ1102","PEDV genome manipulation","rescued virus","study","similar proliferation characteristics","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","wildtype AJ1102","ORF3 gene","lethal watery diarrhea","pathogenic enteric coronavirus","full-length infectious cDNA clone","efficient platform","Cas9 technology","valuable tool","suckling piglets","functions of viral genes","bacterial artificial chromosome","method","Reverse genetics","vaccine candidates","CRISPR","week","RNA viruses"],"language":"en"},

In the last century, some researchers and clinician have noticed that the psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning of patients with malignant gliomas can be impaired. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that part of patients, adults or children, diagnosed with glioblastoma will suffer from cognitive deficiency during their clinical course, especially in long-term survivors. Many nanoparticles (NPs) can inhibit the biological functions of tumours by modulating tumour-associated inflammation, which provokes angiogenesis and tumour growth. As one of the best antiviral nanoparticles (AVNPs), AVNP2 is the 2nd generation of AVNP2 that have been conjugated to graphite-graphene for improving physiochemical performance and reducing toxicity. AVNP2 inactivates viruses, such as the H1N1 and H5N1influenza viruses and even the SARS coronavirus, while it inhibits bacteria, such as MRSA and E. coli. As antimicrobials, nanoparticles are considered to be one of the vectors for the administration of therapeutic compounds. Yet, little is known about their potential functionalities and toxicities to the neurotoxic effects of cancer. Herein, we explored the functionality of AVNP2 on inhibiting C6 in glioma-bearing rats. The novel object-recognition test and open-field test showed that AVNP2 significantly improved the neuro-behaviour affected by C6 glioma. AVNP2 also alleviated the decline of long-term potentiation (LTP) and the decreased density of dendritic spines in the CA1 region induced by C6. Western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the expressions of synaptic-related proteins (PSD-95 and SYP) were increased, and these findings were in accordance with the results mentioned above. It revealed that the sizes of tumours in C6 glioma-bearing rats were smaller after treatment with AVNP2. The decreased expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1\u03B2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1) by Western blotting assay and ELISA, angiogenesis protein (VEGF) by Western blotting assay and other related proteins (BDNF, NF-\u0138B, iNOS and COX-2) by Western blotting assay in peri-tumour tissue indicated that AVNP2 could control tumour-associated inflammation, thus efficiently ameliorating the local inflammatory condition and, to some extent, inhibiting angiogenesis in C6-bearing rats. In conclusion, our results suggested that AVNP2 could have an effect on the peri-tumor environment, obviously restraining the growth progress of gliomas, and eventually improving cognitive levels in C6-bearing rats.","publish_time":"2020-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Junyang; Liu, Meicen; Gao, Jin; Jiang, Yu; Wu, Limin; Cheong, Yuen-Ki; Ren, Guogang; Yang, Zhuo","journal":"Brain Behav Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0dbe4d649872b1ecd33637cf4bcdeca805d2b714.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126810.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159119314175; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159119314175; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.02.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32097763/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functionality of AVNP2","generation of AVNP2","C6 glioma","rats","inhibiting C6","Western blotting assay","tumour growth","Western blot assay","peri-tumour tissue","kind of malignant tumour","modulating tumour-associated inflammation","related proteins","angiogenesis protein","malignant gliomas","results","growth progress of gliomas","best antiviral nanoparticles","decreased expression of inflammatory factors","sizes of tumours","cognitive deficiency","cognitive levels","clinical course","Abstract Glioblastoma","H5N1influenza viruses","long-term survivors","clinical studies","open-field test","biological functions of tumours","neurocognitive functioning of patients","peri-tumor environment","decline of long-term potentiation","local inflammatory condition","novel object-recognition test","decreased density of dendritic spines","BDNF","ELISA","VEGF","NF-\u0138B","immunofluorescence staining","toxicities","LTP","expressions of synaptic","COX","TNF-\u03B1","CA1 region","physiochemical performance","neurotoxic effects of cancer","iNOS","SARS coronavirus","PSD","AVNPs","extent","neuro-behaviour","potential functionalities","graphite-graphene","clinician","vectors","administration of therapeutic compounds","bacteria","central nervous system","H1N1","adults","children","treatment","MRSA","century","researchers","toxicity","findings","accordance","SYP","conclusion","coli","antimicrobials"],"language":"en"},

Comprehensive surveillance of morbidity and mortality for dozens of conditions has since been well established in the United States and in other industrialized countries. However, despite the clear need for epidemiological data to inform health policies, reliable and comprehensive health statistics are not available in many developing countries. International efforts to assess and monitor the burden of certain diseases have been limited in the past to a small number of infectious diseases in the context of global eradication programs \u2013 smallpox, poliomyelitis, guinea worm, and, more recently, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian flu influenza A (H5N1). The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), published in 1996, filled an important gap in our knowledge of population health status. It created a common metric, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), to estimate morbidity and mortality for eight regions that collectively span the world\u2019s population, generating comparable information on incidence and prevalence in global health. However, patterns of disease, disability, and risk factors have since changed significantly and new data on their distribution are available. Furthermore, the unprecedented money and attention now pouring into international health has made an accurate assessment of global health patterns a matter of utmost urgency. The new Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD 2005) project, which began in 2007, represents the first major effort at a systematic revision of estimates in health for every region in the world comprehensively, and will ensure that that the global health community bases its research and policies on complete, valid, and reliable information. Burden of disease estimates provided in this article are for 2001 \u2013 the year for which the most recent estimates of the global burden of disease and risk factors are currently available. Causes of deaths were categorized into three main groups: group I (infectious diseases and maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions), group II (noncommunicable diseases), and group III (injuries). Accordingly, estimates of the global burden of infectious diseases are provided in the context of the overall burden from other conditions, diseases, and injuries. The relative importance of the burden of infectious diseases was forecasted to change by 2020. As the epidemiological transition progresses worldwide, a decline in the burden of infectious diseases is expected as the burden of noncommunicable diseases and injuries gradually increases. The pace of the epidemiological transition, however, varies greatly among regions so that the projected decreases in the burden of infectious diseases are expected to vary between regions. Trends in the global burden due to specific infectious diseases projected to 2020 also vary among specific conditions. The global burden of HIV/AIDS, for instance, is expected to greatly increase, whereas the global burden due to respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases is expected to decrease. Contrary to expectations, the global burden of malaria has increased in recent years.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michaud, C.

To perform these functions, it has been suggested that protein E can form a membrane destabilizing transmembrane (TM) hairpin, or homooligomerize to form a TM pore. Indeed, in a recent study we reported that the \u03B1-helical putative transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms several SDS-resistant TM interactions: a dimer, a trimer, and two pentameric forms. Further, these interactions were found to be evolutionarily conserved. Herein, we have studied multiple isotopically labeled ETM peptides reconstituted in model lipid bilayers, using the orientational parameters derived from infrared dichroic data. We show that the topology of ETM is consistent with a regular TM \u03B1-helix. Further, the orientational parameters obtained unequivocally correspond to a homopentameric model, by comparison with previous predictions. We have independently confirmed that the full polypeptide of E protein can also aggregate as pentamers after expression in Escherichia coli. This interaction must be stabilized, at least partially, at the TM domain. The model we report for this pentameric \u03B1-helical bundle may explain some of the permabilizing properties of protein E, and should be the basis of mutagenesis efforts in future functional studies.","publish_time":"2006-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torres, Jaume; Parthasarathy, Krupakar; Lin, Xin; Saravanan, Rathi; Kukol, Andreas; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Biophysical Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bcd8f253aeaeee05b09ba5d06e7a3ff1cd809b9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e0fd1f385f30d5ceed4cbd9dc5943d3879bf215d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1563757.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349506718069; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349506718069; http://www.cell.com/article/S0006349506718069/pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ETM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["polypeptide of E protein","TM domain","\u03B1-helical putative transmembrane domain of E protein","permabilizing properties of protein E","TM pore","regular TM \u03B1-helix","small envelope protein","SDS-resistant TM interactions","ETM peptides","topology of ETM","pentameric \u03B1-helical bundle","orientational parameters","homopentameric model","pentameric forms","model lipid bilayers","putative involvement","severe acute respiratory syndrome","host apoptosis","basis of mutagenesis efforts","pentamers","future functional studies","coronavirus responsible","virus morphogenesis","comparison","infrared dichroic data","trimer","dimer","previous predictions","expression","Escherichia coli","hairpin","recent study","functions"],"language":"en"},

Although broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the HIV-1 were observed in patients, elicitation of such bnAbs remains a major challenge when compared to other viral targets. We previously hypothesized that HIV-1 could have evolved a strategy to evade the immune system due to absent or very weak binding of germline antibodies to the conserved epitopes that may not be sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an effective immune response. To further explore our hypothesis, we used the 454 sequence analysis of a large na\u00EFve library of human IgM antibodies which had been used for selecting antibodies against SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble G proteins (sG) of henipaviruses. We found that the human IgM repertoires from the 454 sequencing have diverse germline usages, recombination patterns, junction diversity, and a lower extent of somatic mutation. In this study, we identified antibody maturation intermediates that are related to bnAbs against the HIV-1 and other viruses as observed in normal individuals, and compared their genetic diversity and somatic mutation level along with available structural and functional data. Further computational analysis will provide framework for understanding the underlying genetic and molecular determinants related to maturation pathways of antiviral bnAbs that could be useful for applying novel approaches to the design of effective vaccine immunogens and antibody-based therapeutics.","publish_time":"2012-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prabakaran, Ponraj; Zhu, Zhongyu; Chen, Weizao; Gong, Rui; Feng, Yang; Streaker, Emily; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9a8782661a61d1562b8d6a2098fd35c76b35349.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3410596.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22876240/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV","neutralizing antibodies","weak binding of germline antibodies","antibody-based therapeutics","genetic diversity","effective vaccines","large na\u00EFve library of human IgM antibodies","antibody maturation intermediates","maturation pathways of antiviral bnAbs","SARS coronavirus","effective immune response","Nipah viruses","henipaviruses","understanding","SARS CoV receptor-binding domain","somatic mutation level","human IgM repertoires","junction diversity","design of effective vaccine immunogens","lower extent of somatic mutation","sequence analysis","immune system","computational analysis","diverse germline usages","RBD","sequencing","recombination patterns","molecular determinants","soluble G proteins","Hendra","novel approaches","conserved epitopes","sG","major challenge","framework","functional data","normal individuals","elicitation","study","patients","viral targets","strategy","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

In early 2009, many people were admitted to hospitals in Mexico with severe respiratory failure following an influenza-like illness, subtyped as H1N1. An increased mortality rate was observed. By June 2009, H1N1 was upgraded to pandemic status. In June\u2013July, Australian ICUs were experiencing increased activity due to the influenza pandemic. While hospitals implemented plans for the pandemic, the particularly heavy demand to provide critical care facilities to accommodate an influx of people with severe respiratory failure became evident and placed a great burden on provision of these services. This paper describes the initial experience (June to mid September) of the pandemic from the nursing perspective in a single Australian ICU. Patients were noted to be younger with a higher proportion of women, two of whom were pregnant. Two patients had APACHE III comorbidity. Of the 31 patients admitted during this period, three patients died in ICU and one patient died in hospital. Aerosol precautions were initiated for all patients. The requirement for single room accommodation placed enormous demands for bed management in ICU. Specific infection control procedures were developed to deal with this new pandemic influenza.","publish_time":"2010-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leen, Tim; Williams, Teresa A.; Campbell, Lorraine; Chamberlain, Jenny; Gould, Andree; McEntaggart, Geraldine; Leslie, Gavin D.","journal":"Intensive and Critical Care Nursing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c86f353b91d0a371995b5c6f5f02b69253babe8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125814.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096433971000042X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2010.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20599382/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096433971000042X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APACHE III","ICU"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["Patients","influenza pandemic","new pandemic influenza","pandemic status","Summary Influenza","single Australian ICU","severe respiratory failure","influx of people","hospitals","H1N1","large numbers of people","increased activity","Australian ICUs","single room accommodation","increased mortality rate","common seasonal viral infection","Specific infection control procedures","enormous demands","bed management","critical care facilities","heavy demand","nursing perspective","Mexico","great burden","requirement","higher proportion of women","initial experience","provision","services","illness","period","paper","APACHE","comorbidity","Aerosol precautions","plans"],"language":"en"},

At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, all but one was commenced on antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine with doses adjusted for kidney function. At baseline, all patients presented fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing. Half of patients showed chest radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates while the other half showed unilateral changes or no infiltrates. During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy. Six patients developed acute kidney injury with one requiring hemodialysis. Six of 12 patients were treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor. Overall, five kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days [15-19] from symptom onset. These preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia.

However, current studies on respiration flow and the resulted exhaled pollutant dispersion are limited, because different head postures, respiration mode, breath rate, room ventilation and so on, can exert profound impacts that are not understood very clearly. To evaluate the role of head postures on transmission of human exhaled pollutants, this study uses a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to study the exhalation flow of a sitting adult in a calm indoor office. Four different head postures are considered: sitting upright viewing front, sitting upright but head tilted viewing upward, sitting upright but head turned viewing the lateral, and sitting but pillowing head on a table. Based on the decay percentage of a gas concentration, the impacted scope of expired air is identified. The common posture by sitting upright viewing front is selected to investigate the change of impacted scope with increasing exhalation rates.

Test conditions included normal HVAC operation and exhaust failure resulting in loss of negative pressure.

Under exhaust failure, the automated HVAC system maximizes airflow into areas adjacent to isolation rooms to attempt to maintain negative pressure differential. However, 6% of the fluorescent particles were transported through cracks around doors/door handles out of the isolation room via airflow alone and not by movement of personnel or doors.

Although several vaccine candidates have been developed, there is still no clinically available vaccine for MERS-CoV. In this study, we developed two types of MERS-CoV vaccines: a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 encoding the MERS-CoV spike gene (Ad5/MERS) and spike protein nanoparticles formulated with aluminum (alum) adjuvant. Next, we tested a heterologous prime\u2013boost vaccine strategy, which compared priming with Ad5/MERS and boosting with spike protein nanoparticles and vice versa, with homologous prime\u2013boost vaccination comprising priming and boosting with either spike protein nanoparticles or Ad5/MERS. Although both types of vaccine could induce specific immunoglobulin G against MERS-CoV, neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV were induced only by heterologous prime\u2013boost immunization and homologous immunization with spike protein nanoparticles. Interestingly, Th1 cell activation was induced by immunization schedules including Ad5/MERS, but not by those including only spike protein nanoparticles. Heterologous prime\u2013boost vaccination regimens including Ad5/MERS elicited simultaneous Th1 and Th2 responses, but homologous prime\u2013boost regimens did not. Thus, heterologous prime\u2013boost may induce longer-lasting immune responses against MERS-CoV because of an appropriate balance of Th1/Th2 responses. However, both heterologous prime\u2013boost and homologous spike protein nanoparticles vaccinations could provide protection from MERS-CoV challenge in mice. Our results demonstrate that heterologous immunization by priming with Ad5/MERS and boosting with spike protein nanoparticles could be an efficient prophylactic strategy against MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2018-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Seo-Yeon; Kang, Kyung Won; Lee, Eun-Young; Seo, Dong-Won; Kim, Hong-Lim; Kim, Hak; Kwon, TaeWoo; Park, Hye-Lim; Kim, Hun; Lee, Sang-Myeong; Nam, Jae-Hwan","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18c87ac63c04723a939961675d43ff749f929e87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115429.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X1830598X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29739720/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.04.082; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1830598X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["types of MERS","MERS-CoV challenge","MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV spike gene","Ad5","boost immunization","homologous spike protein nanoparticles vaccinations","CoV vaccines","heterologous immunization","boost regimens","boost vaccine strategy","homologous immunization","boost vaccination regimens","priming","types of vaccine","immunization schedules","Th2 responses","available vaccine","vaccine candidates","simultaneous Th1","appropriate balance of Th1","lasting immune responses","Th1 cell activation","efficient prophylactic strategy","protection","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","recombinant adenovirus serotype","specific immunoglobulin G","aluminum","fatality rate","zoonotic virus","antibodies","humans","mice","adjuvant","results","study"],"language":"en"},

We previously showed that PGE(2) stimulated lung cancer cell growth and progression through PGE(2) receptor EP2/EP4-mediated kinase signaling pathways. However, the role of PGE(2) in controlling lung airway epithelial cell phenotype remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of c-Jun and 3-phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE(2). METHOD: The bronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B and HBEc14-KT were cultured and then treated with PGE(2). PDK1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a PDK1 inhibitor, an antagonist of the PGE(2) receptor subtype EP4 and EP4 siRNA, c-Jun siRNA, and overexpressions of c-Jun and PDK1 have been used to evaluate the effects on cell proliferation. RESULTS: We demonstrated that PGE(2) increased normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through induction of PDK1, an ankyrin repeat-containing Ser/Thr kinase implicated in the induction of apoptosis and the suppression of tumor growth. PDK1 siRNA and a PDK1 inhibitor blocked the effects of PGE(2) on normal cell growth. The PGE(2)-induced PDK1 expression was blocked by an antagonist of the PGE(2) receptor subtype EP4 and by EP4 siRNA. In addition, we showed that induction of PDK1 by PGE(2) was associated with induction of the transcription factor, c-Jun protein. Silencing of c-Jun using siRNA and point mutations of c-Jun sites in the PDK1 gene promoter resulted in blockade of PDK1 expression and promoter activity induced by PGE(2). In contrast, overexpression of c-Jun induced PDK1 gene promoter activity and expression followed increased cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: PGE(2) increases normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through increased PDK1 gene expression that is dependent on EP4 and induction of c-Jun. Therewith, our data suggest a new role of c-Jun and PDK1 in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE(2).","publish_time":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Yu; Wang, Ye; Wang, Ke","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37e2ecefeffdf8d95f1509809b59fe0464abba44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4699375.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26684827/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-015-0309-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDK1 siRNA","induction of PDK1","effects of PGE","role of PGE","PDK1 inhibitor","induced PDK1 expression","induction of c","blockade of PDK1 expression","increased PDK1 gene expression","epithelial cell hyperplasia","EP4 siRNA","effects of c","increased cell proliferation","normal cell growth","induced PDK1 gene promoter activity","normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation","overexpression of c","overexpressions of c","mutations of c","Silencing of c","PDK1 small interfering RNA","bronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS","lung airway epithelial cell phenotype","new role of c","receptor subtype EP4","stimulated lung cancer cell growth","EP4-mediated kinase","induction of apoptosis","suppression of tumor growth","receptor EP2","Thr kinase","phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase","antagonist","progression","ankyrin repeat","reproduction","inflammation","sites","Cyclooxygenase","Ser","derived prostaglandin E","transcription factor","data","METHOD","biological processes","HBEc14-KT","pathways","BACKGROUND","contrast","bioactive eicosanoid","addition","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Results showed that 1.28mM potassium was the optimum for H. cordata as highest values of dry weight, shoot height, root length and number were obtained at this concentration. The optimum potassium concentration resulted in the maximum net photosynthetic rate which could be associated with the highest chlorophyll content rather than limited stomatal conductance. The supply of surplus potassium resulted in higher content of foliar potassium, but negatively correlated with the biomass. Both potassium starvation (0mM) and high potassium (\u003E1.28mM) could lead to water loss through high transpiration rate and low water absorption, respectively, and resulted in H2O2 accumulation and increased activities of catalase and peroxidase, which suggested induction of oxidative stress.

The deaths of four schoolchildren, during a pandemic influenza outbreak in December 2017 in Ghana, raised doubts about the ILI surveillance system\u2019s performance. We evaluated the ILI surveillance system in the Greater Accra region, Ghana, to assess the system\u2019s attributes and its performance on set objectives. METHODS: CDC guidelines were used to evaluate the data of the ILI surveillance system between 2013 and 2017. We interviewed the surveillance personnel on the system\u2019s description and operation. Additionally, routinely entered ILI data from the National Influenza Center provided by the six sentinel sites in Accra was extracted. We sampled and reviewed 120 ILI case-investigation forms from these sites. Surveillance activities were examined on system\u2019s performance indicators, each being scored on a scale of 1 to 3 (poorest to best performance). RESULTS: All population and age groups were under ILI surveillance over the period evaluated. Overall, 2948 suspected case-patients, including 392 (13.3%) children under-five were reported, with 219 being positive for influenza virus (Predictive value positive = 7.4%). The predominant influenza subtype was H3N2, recorded in 90 (41.1%) of positive case-patients. The system only met two out of its four objectives. None of the six sentinel sites consistently met their annual 260 suspected case-detection quota. Samples reached the laboratory on average 48 hours after collection and results were disseminated within 7 days. Of 120 case-investigation forms sampled, 91 (76.3%) were completely filled in. CONCLUSIONS: The ILI surveillance system in the Greater Accra region is only partially meeting its objectives. While it is found to be sensitive, representative and timely, the data quality was sub-optimal. We recommend the determination of thresholds for alert and outbreak detection and ensuring that sentinel sites meet their weekly case-detection targets.","publish_time":"2019-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nuvey, Francis Sena; Edu-Quansah, Elijah Paa; Kuma, George Khumalo; Eleeza, John; Kenu, Ernest; Sackey, Samuel; Ameme, Donne; Abakar, Mahamat Fayiz; Kreppel, Katharina; Ngandolo, Richard Bongo; Afari, Edwin; Bonfoh, Bassirou","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2e781c81e340e91a0f27009b29d0c8a3635c5e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6417674.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30870489/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213627","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","National Influenza Center"],"locations":["Ghana","Accra"],"keyphrases":["ILI surveillance system\u2019s performance","ILI data","ILI case-investigation forms","surveillance personnel","Surveillance activities","positive case-patients","influenza virus","sentinel sites","suspected case-patients","pandemic influenza outbreak","system\u2019s performance indicators","suspected case-detection quota","weekly case-detection targets","National Influenza Center","predominant influenza subtype","outbreak detection","system\u2019s attributes","system\u2019s description","best performance","set objectives","Greater Accra region","medical diagnosis of possible influenza","data quality","Ghana","RESULTS","Predictive value positive","respiratory illness","common set of symptoms","average","age groups","doubts","laboratory","hours","collection","alert","schoolchildren","population","determination of thresholds","operation","H3N2","CONCLUSIONS","CDC guidelines","METHODS","Samples","BACKGROUND","period","children under-five","scale","deaths","days"],"language":"en"},

It is widely accepted that arenaviral infections, including JUNV infections, are generally non-cytopathic. In contrast, here we demonstrated apoptosis induction in human lung epithelial carcinoma (A549), human hepatocarcinoma and Vero cells upon infection with the attenuated Candid#1 strain of, JUNV as determined by phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation, Caspase 3 (CASP3) activation, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and/or chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Moreover, as determined by DNA fragmentation, we found that the pathogenic Romero strain of JUNV was less cytopathic than Candid#1 in human hepatocarcinoma and Vero, but more apoptotic in A549 and Vero E6 cells. Additionally, we found that JUNV-induced apoptosis was enhanced by RIG-I signaling. Consistent with the previously reported role of RIG-I like helicase (RLH) signaling in initiating programmed cell death, we showed that cell death or DNA fragmentation of Candid#1-infected A549 cells was decreased upon siRNA or shRNA silencing of components of RIG-I pathway in spite of increased virus production. Similarly, we observed decreased DNA fragmentation in JUNV-infected human hepatocarcinoma cells deficient for RIG-I when compared with that of RIG-I-competent cells. In addition, DNA fragmentation detected upon Candid#1 infection of type I interferon (IFN)-deficient Vero cells suggested a type I IFN-independent mechanism of apoptosis induction in response to JUNV. Our work demonstrated for the first time apoptosis induction in various cells of mammalian origin in response to JUNV infection and partial mechanism of this cell death.","publish_time":"2014-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kolokoltsova, Olga A.; Grant, Ashley M.; Huang, Cheng; Smith, Jennifer K.; Poussard, Allison L.; Tian, Bing; Brasier, Allan R.; Peters, Clarence J.; Tseng, Chien-Te Kent; de la Torre, Juan C.; Paessler, Slobodan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c42f9e96fcbb25a8f456fb17af3d591c1300ae64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4053358.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918927/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099610","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JUNV","Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JUNV infections","DNA fragmentation of Candid","JUNV-infected human hepatocarcinoma cells deficient","deficient Vero cells","JUNV-induced apoptosis","infected A549 cells","Vero E6 cells","competent cells","decreased DNA fragmentation","chromosomal DNA fragmentation","human disease","pathogenic Romero strain of JUNV","time apoptosis induction","various cells of mammalian origin","infection of type","attenuated Candid","IFN-independent mechanism of apoptosis induction","reported role of RIG","response","human lung epithelial carcinoma","initiating programmed cell death","partial mechanism","arenaviral infections","Junin virus","spite of increased virus production","ADP-ribose","AHF","pathway","cleavage","siRNA","etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever","Caspase","CASP3","activation","polymerase","PARP","RLH","interferon","shRNA silencing of components","high case-fatality rate","translocation","helicase","phosphatidylserine","PS","addition","work","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug\u2019s safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC(50)=0.72 \u03BCM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC(50)=5.47 \u03BCM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Xueting; Ye, Fei; Zhang, Miao; Cui, Cheng; Huang, Baoying; Niu, Peihua; Liu, Xu; Zhao, Li; Dong, Erdan; Song, Chunli; Zhan, Siyan; Lu, Roujian; Li, Haiyan; Tan, Wenjie; Liu, Dongyang","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10020b18a770b4f93c8413bbf60029225d151471.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150618/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa237","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBPK","EC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ill SARS-CoV","hydroxychloroquine concentrations","use of hydroxychloroquine","hydroxychloroquine sulfate","immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine","PBPK models","infection","pharmacological activity of chloroquine","potency of chloroquine phosphate","pharmacokinetic models","days","\u03BCM","RESULTS","drug\u2019s safety profile","tolerable safety profile","infected patients","loading dose","maintenance dose","infected Vero cells","preferred drug","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","lung fluid","effective regimen","phase","malaria","different dosing regimens","BACKGROUND","times","autoimmune conditions","cytokine storm","METHODS","mechanism of action","drugs","evidence","Wuhan","China","data","advance","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This new model of malaria-associated lung pathology, without any accompanying cerebral complications, allows the investigation of mechanisms leading to the lung disease. The activity of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in alveolar epithelial cells is decreased by several respiratory tract pathogens and this is suggested to contribute to pulmonary oedema. We show that PbK, a pathogen that remains in the circulation, also decreased the activity and expression of ENaC, suggesting that infectious agents can have indirect effects on ENaC activity in lung epithelial cells.

We modified an existing N95 mask to optimize O(2) supplementation while maintaining respiratory isolation. METHODS: An N95 mask was modified to deliver O(2) by inserting a plastic manifold consisting of a 1-way inspiratory valve, an O(2) inlet and a gas reservoir. In a prospective repeated-measures study, we studied 10 healthy volunteers in each of 3 phases, investigating (1) the fractional inspiratory concentrations of O(2) (F(I)O(2)) delivered by the N95 O(2) mask, the Hi-Ox(80) O(2) mask, and the nonrebreathing mask during resting ventilation and hyperventilation, each at 3 O(2) flow rates; (2) the ability of the N95 mask, the N95 O(2) mask, and the nonrebreathing mask to filter microparticles from ambient air; and (3) to contain microparticles generated inside the mask. RESULTS: The F(I)O(2)s (median [range]) delivered by the Hi-Ox(80) O(2) mask, the N95 O(2) mask, and the nonrebreathing mask during resting ventilation, at 8 L/minute O(2) flow, were 0.90 (0.79 to 0.96), 0.68 (0.60 to 0.85), and 0.59 (0.52 to 0.68), respectively. During hyperventilation, the FiO(2)s of all 3 masks were clinically equivalent. The N95 O(2) mask, but not the nonrebreathing mask, provided the same efficiency of filtration of internal and external particles as the original N95, regardless of O(2) flow into the mask.

This study was performed to evaluate the proportion of adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae among Hajj pilgrims in 2016. To add sensitivity to etiological attribution, a urine antigen test was used in addition to culture-based methods. Methods Adult subjects hospitalized with X-ray-confirmed CAP were enrolled prospectively from all general hospitals designated to treat Hajj pilgrims in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Patients were treated according to local standard of care and administered the BinaxNow S. pneumoniae urine antigen test. Results From August 23 to September 23, 2016, a total of 266 patients with CAP were enrolled in the study, 70.6% of whom were admitted to hospitals in Mecca; 53% of the cases were admitted after the peak of Hajj. Patients originated from 43 countries. Their mean age was 65.3 years and the male to female ratio was 2:1. Just over 36% of the cases had diabetes, 10% declared that they were smokers, and 45.4% of cases were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The overall case-fatality rate was 10.1%, but was higher among those treated in the ICU and in those with invasive disease. The proportion of CAP cases positive for S. pneumoniae, based on culture or urine antigen test, was 18.0% (95% confidence interval 13.9\u201323.1%). Conclusions CAP during Hajj has an important clinical impact. A proportion of CAP cases among Hajj pilgrims were attributable to S. pneumoniae, a pathogen for which vaccines are available. Additional studies to determine the serotypes causing pneumococcal disease could further inform vaccine policy for Hajj pilgrims.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"AlBarrak, Ali; Alotaibi, Badriah; Yassin, Yara; Mushi, Abdulaziz; Maashi, Fuad; Seedahmed, Yassein; Alshaer, Mohamed; Altaweel, Abdulaziz; Elshiekh, Husameddin; Turkistani, Abdulhafiz; Petigara, Tanaz; Grabenstein, John; Yezli, Saber","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fa911cd18b7c5a91aa71075b69882176177248c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110457.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29474989/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2018.02.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971218300444; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218300444","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","BinaxNow S. pneumoniae","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["ICU","CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hajj pilgrims","cases attributable","peak of Hajj","proportion of CAP cases positive","Conclusions CAP","pneumoniae urine antigen test","Hajj mass gathering","Patients","Streptococcus pneumoniae","pneumococcal disease","proportion of adult community","ICU","culture-based methods","invasive disease","study","Methods Adult subjects","general hospitals","holy cities of Mecca","local standard of care","intensive care unit","BinaxNow","years","etiological attribution","risk","vaccine policy","X-ray","serotypes","Abstract Background","pathogen","important clinical impact","overall case-fatality rate","female ratio","Medina","sensitivity","vaccines","mean age","Additional studies","total","confidence interval","countries","diabetes","smokers","Results"],"language":"en"},

Ethnobiology and ethnomedicine-centred research has moved at the (partially artificial and fictitious) interface between nature and culture and has investigated human consumption of wild foods and wild animals, as well as the use of wild animals or their parts for medicinal and other purposes, along with the associated knowledge, skills, practices, and beliefs. Little attention has been paid, however, to the complex interplay of social and cultural reasons behind the increasing pressure on wildlife. The available literature suggest that there are two main drivers that enhance the necessary conditions for infectious diseases to cross the species barrier from wild animals to humans: (1) the encroachment of human activities (e.g., logging, mining, agricultural expansion) into wild areas and forests and consequent ecological disruptions; and, connected to the former, (2) the commodification of wild animals (and natural resources in general) and an expanding demand and market for wild meat and live wild animals, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In particular, a crucial role may have been played by the bushmeat-euphoria and attached elitist gastronomies and conspicuous consumption phenomena. The COVID-19 pandemic will likely require ethnobiologists to reschedule research agendas and to envision new epistemological trajectories aimed at more effectively mitigating the mismanagement of natural resources that ultimately threats our and other beings\u2019 existence.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Volpato, Gabriele; Fontefrancesco, Michele F.; Gruppuso, Paolo; Zocchi, Dauro M.; Pieroni, Andrea","journal":"J Ethnobiol Ethnomed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6a9c149fce712b80f92025e6673ad04af151a8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171915.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13002-020-00366-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32316979/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wild areas","live wild animals","use of wild animals","commodification of wild animals","wild meat","human consumption of wild foods","nature","human societies","sub-tropical areas","encroachment of human activities","ethnomedicine-centred research","mismanagement of natural resources","scientific knowledge","associated knowledge","research agendas","Journal of Ethnobiology","years of existence","beings\u2019 existence","conspicuous consumption phenomena","cultural reasons","inextricable links","elitist gastronomies","forests","species barrier","market","expanding demand","agricultural expansion","necessary conditions","infectious diseases","logging","mining","culture","parts","humans","consequent ecological disruptions","increasing pressure","complex interplay of social","skills","practices","interface","purposes","JEET","new epistemological trajectories","main drivers","bushmeat-euphoria","respected outlet","wildlife","ethnobiologists","crucial role","pandemic","beliefs","health","available literature","Little attention","COVID"],"language":"en"},

Then, many fetuses/newborns died in utero or shortly after birth. With time, the issue of sepsis was addressed, and a greater number of newborns survived. Gradually, in this soil, the disciplines of pediatrics and pediatric nursing arose, as some recognized that infants were not merely small adults but were, in fact, quite different. Years later, pediatric pathology developed as a field of exploration. Today, pediatric pathology is a specialty, as witnessed by training programs, societies devoted to research and education, an expanding number of textbooks and innovative research. Pediatric pathology is distinct from adult pathology, as seen by the diversity of malformations and metabolic diseases stemming from mutations, the immaturity of the newborn\u0027s immune system, and the types of neoplasms germane to infants and children. Much of the progress in these areas was facilitated by the simultaneous emergence of cytogenetics and molecular biology and their powerful tools of investigation. The latter were applied in a synergistic fashion to a major extent in maternity clinics and children\u0027s hospitals by, among others, molecular biologists, clinical geneticists, cytogeneticists, pediatricians, and pediatric pathologists. This article describes a select but small number of the many contributions of pediatrics and pediatric pathology to the current body of medical knowledge.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nezelof, Christian; Seemayer, Thomas A.; Bridge, Julia A.","journal":"Human Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6c2760f426e1d88aa3ee8c09d7fdffffbda1ce5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119320.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740520/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humpath.2009.06.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0046817709002421; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0046817709002421","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric pathology","pediatric nursing","pediatric pathologists","adult pathology","small number","contributions of pediatrics","disciplines of pediatrics","infants","greater number of newborns","expanding number of textbooks","molecular biology","molecular biologists","innovative research","small adults","cytogeneticists","major extent","maternity clinics","mutations","immaturity","children\u0027s hospitals","types of neoplasms germane","simultaneous emergence of cytogenetics","clinical geneticists","pediatricians","education","newborn\u0027s immune system","metabolic diseases","current body of medical knowledge","powerful tools of investigation","training programs","societies","diversity of malformations","specialty","synergistic fashion","areas","utero","fact","issue of sepsis","field of exploration","time","fetuses","century","soil","article","Years","Summary","progress","birth"],"language":"en"},

It also remains to be investigated whether viruses deploy some mechanism to be able to overcome this immune response. Here, we have used an RNA-Seq approach to identify differentially regulated genes in Culex quinquefasciatus cells following West Nile virus (WNV) infection, identifying 265 transcripts from various cellular pathways that were either upregulated or downregulated. Ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway genes, comprising 12% of total differentially regulated genes, were selected for further validation by real time RT-qPCR and functional analysis. It was found that treatment of infected cells with proteasomal inhibitor, MG-132, decreased WNV titers, indicating importance of this pathway during infection process. In infection models, the Culex ortholog of mammalian Cul4A/B (cullin RING ubiquitin ligase) was found to be upregulated in vitro as well as in vivo, especially in midguts of mosquitoes. Gene knockdown using dsRNA and overexpression studies indicated that Culex Cul4 acts as a pro-viral protein by degradation of CxSTAT via ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. We also show that gene knockdown of Culex Cul4 leads to activation of the Jak-STAT pathway in mosquitoes leading to decrease viral replication in the body as well as saliva. Our results suggest a novel mechanism adopted by WNV to overcome mosquito immune response and increase viral replication.","publish_time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paradkar, Prasad N.; Duchemin, Jean-Bernard; Rodriguez-Andres, Julio; Trinidad, Lee; Walker, Peter J.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e62bebc2ecb5a648b06eb708f88a8024231a474d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4556628.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26325027/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","Ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway genes","viral replication","gene knockdown of Culex Cul4","regulated genes","infection models","infection process","Culex Cul4 acts","Culex quinquefasciatus cells","pro-viral protein","mosquito immune response","proteasomal inhibitor","Jak-STAT pathway","midguts of mosquitoes","Culex ortholog of mammalian Cul4A","decreased WNV titers","cullin RING ubiquitin ligase","novel mechanism","treatment of infected cells","pathogens of public health importance","West Nile virus","overexpression studies","degradation of CxSTAT","real time RT-qPCR","activation","validation","transcripts","dsRNA","various cellular pathways","functional analysis","vectors","RNA-Seq approach","body","total","results","viruses","saliva"],"language":"en"},

LSECtin acts as a pathogen attachment factor for Ebolavirus and the SARS coronavirus, and its expression can be induced by interleukin\u20104 on monocytes and macrophages. Although reported as a liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell\u2010specific molecule, LSECtin could be detected in the MUTZ\u20103 dendritic\u2010like cell line at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level, and immunohistochemistry analysis on human liver revealed its presence in Kupffer cells coexpressing the myeloid marker CD68. The expression of LSECtin in myeloid cells was further corroborated through the analysis of the proximal regulatory region of the human LSECtin gene, whose activity was maximal in LSECtin\u002B myeloid cells, and which contains a highly conserved PU.1\u2010binding site. PU.1 transactivated the LSECtin regulatory region in collaboration with hematopoietic\u2010restricted transcription factors (Myb, RUNX3), and was found to bind constitutively to the LSECtin proximal promoter.

The causative agent is a new strain of coronavirus most likely originating from wild animals. This disease first emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. Early in the outbreak the infection had been transmitted primarily via household contacts and healthcare settings. In late February 2003 the infection was transmitted to Hong Kong when an infected doctor from the mainland visited there. During his stay in Hong Kong at least 17 guests and visitors were infected at the hotel at which he stayed. By modern day air travel, the infection was rapidly spread to other countries including Vietnam, Singapore and Canada by these infected guests. With the implementation of effective control strategies including early isolation of suspected cases, strict infection control measures in the hospital setting, meticulous contact tracing and quarantine, the outbreak was finally brought under control by July 2003. In addition, there were another two events of SARS in China between the end of December 2003 and January 2004 and from March to May 2004; both were readily controlled without significant patient spread.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Nan-Shan; Wong, Gary W.K.","journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72d96367343485f9bdb4f29c556d3203ca6a7c14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106189.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054204000806; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054204000806","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vietnam, Singapore and Canada"],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["respiratory infection","strict infection control measures","infected guests","Hong Kong","infected doctor","China","outbreak","implementation of effective control strategies","events of SARS","early isolation of suspected cases","Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome","hospital setting","meticulous contact tracing","quarantine","Singapore","Canada","new strain of coronavirus","modern day air travel","countries","visitors","causative agent","household contacts","healthcare settings","Vietnam","stay","pandemic potential","wild animals","Guangdong Province","mainland","end","significant patient","addition","hotel","disease"],"language":"en"},

Enforced by State-related actors, these were promoted as the only method to curtail transmissions as soon as possible. However, as with other harsh measures witnessed by Liberian citizens, in many cases those measures elicited uncontrolled negative reactions within the communities (stigma; fear) that produced, in some cases, the opposite effect of that intended. METHODOLOGY: The research has been conducted in two phases, for a total of 8 weeks. Ethnography of local practices was carried out in 7 neighbourhoods in Monrovia and 5 villages in Grand Cape Mount County in Liberia. 45 Focus Group Discussions (432 participants) and 30 semi-structured interviews sustained the observing participation. Randomly selected people from different social layers were targeted. The principal investigator worked with the help of two local assistants. Perceptions and practices were both analysed. RESULTS: Participants stressed how cremation perpetuated the social breakdown that started with the isolation for the sickness. Socio-economical divides were created by inequitable management of the dead: those who could bribe the burial teams obtained a burial in a private cemetery or the use of Funeral Homes. Conversely, those in economic disadvantage were forced to send their dead for cremation. State-enforced quarantine, with a mandatory prohibition of movement, raised condemnation, strengthened stigmatization and created serious socio-economic distress. Food was distributed intermittently and some houses shared latrines with non-quarantined neighbours. Escapes were also recorded. Study participants narrated how they adopted local measures of containment, through local task forces and socially-rooted control of outsiders. They also stressed how information that was not spread built up rumours and suspicion. CONCLUSIONS: Populations experiencing an epidemic feel a high degree of social insecurity, in addition to the health hazards. Vertical and coercive measures increase mistrust and fear, producing a counter-productive effect in the containment of the epidemic. On the other hand, local communities show a will to be engaged and a high degree of flexibility in participating to the epidemic response. Efforts in the direction of awareness and community involvement could prove to be better strategy to control the epidemic and root the response on social participation.","publish_time":"2015-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pellecchia, Umberto; Crestani, Rosa; Decroo, Tom; Van den Bergh, Rafael; Al-Kourdi, Yasmine","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c3068bf6e652c02d85923d2438ad4c84d53071a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4674104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26650630/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ebola Virus Disease","Focus Group","Funeral Homes"],"locations":["Liberia","Monrovia","Grand Cape Mount"],"keyphrases":["local measures of containment","local communities","coercive measures","harsh measures","social participation","local assistants","epidemic response","Ethnography of local practices","social breakdown","major emergency disease-control measures","local task forces","high degree of social insecurity","cremation of bodies","cases","different social layers","fear","Study participants","dead","high degree of flexibility","rooted control of outsiders","enforcement of quarantine","burial teams","observing participation","opposite effect","Ebola Virus Disease","counter-productive effect","State-related actors","outbreak","villages","Grand Cape Mount County","elicited uncontrolled negative reactions","houses","stigmatization","condemnation","private cemetery","EVD","addition","mistrust","community involvement","asymptomatic individuals","contact","direction of awareness","latrines","non-quarantined neighbours","Monrovia","mandatory prohibition of movement","inequitable management","selected people","help","structured interviews","Liberian citizens","use of Funeral Homes","better strategy","Socio-economical divides","serious socio-economic distress","neighbourhoods","INTRODUCTION","Focus Group Discussions","isolation","Populations","health hazards","research","total","phases","positive case","principal investigator","Efforts","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","hand","economic disadvantage","rumours","suspicion","transmissions","METHODOLOGY","weeks","sickness","Food","Perceptions","Escapes","information"],"language":"en"},

The importance of this sialic acid binding ability during infection is, however, quite different. We compared the spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Whereas sialic acid is the only receptor determinant known so far for IBV, TGEV requires interaction with its receptor aminopeptidase N to initiate infection of cells. Binding tests with soluble spike proteins carrying an IgG Fc-tag revealed pronounced differences between these two viral proteins. Binding of the IBV spike protein to host cells was in all experiments sialic acid dependent, whereas the soluble TGEV spike showed binding to APN but had no detectable sialic acid binding activity. Our results underline the different ways in which binding to sialoglycoconjugates is mediated by coronavirus spike proteins.","publish_time":"2013-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shahwan, Katarina; Hesse, Martina; Mork, Ann-Kathrin; Herrler, Georg; Winter, Christine","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e24a0cd976fbe3f6a625425e6c9899d52af1067f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3761233.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v5081924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23896748/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IgG Fc-tag"],"organizations":["TGEV","IBV","APN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["soluble spike proteins","IBV spike protein","soluble TGEV spike","sialic acid binding ability","coronavirus spike proteins","Binding tests","detectable sialic acid binding activity","spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus","spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus","experiments sialic acid dependent","viral proteins","sialic acids present","infection of cells","receptor determinant","different ways","receptor aminopeptidase N","APN","IgG Fc-tag","pronounced differences","interaction","sialoglycoconjugates","number of coronaviruses","cell surface","importance","results"],"language":"en"},

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is characterized by cervical lymphadenopathy occurring in young adults. Neurologic involvement is rare, and testitis directly caused by Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease has not yet been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old man was brought to our clinic with complaints of fever, headache, fatigue, and left lower quadrant pain that had persisted for 3 weeks. On physical examination, painful cervical lymphadenopathies were observed. Meningitis was suspected based on a cerebrospinal fluid examination, and left-sided orchitis was diagnosed based on findings from magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography. However, neither antibiotics nor antiviral drugs were effective in treating the patient\u2019s symptoms. On the 20(th) day of hospitalization, the patient experienced a loss of consciousness, and brain T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed asymmetrical, high-signal intensities in both basal nuclei and the left temporal lobe. Encephalitis was suspected, and the patient was treated with intravenous prednisolone pulse therapy (1 g/day) for 3 days and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for 5 days. A left cervical lymph node biopsy showed apoptotic necrosis in paracortical and cortical areas with an abundance of macrophages and large lymphoid cells, which had irregular nuclei suggestive of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease; the pathological findings from a brain biopsy were the same as those of the cervical lymph node biopsy. The encephalitis and cervical lymphadenopathies followed a benign course, as did the testitis. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease involving painful testitis and pathologically proven asymmetrical brain regions. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease should be included in the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with encephalitis, testitis, and fever of unknown origin.","publish_time":"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kido, Hidenori; Kano, Osamu; Hamai, Asami; Masuda, Hiroyuki; Fuchinoue, Yutaka; Nemoto, Masaaki; Arai, Chiaki; Takeda, Teppei; Yamabe, Fumihito; Tai, Toshihiro; Kasahara, Mizuki; Suzuki, Kenichi; Shiraga, Nobuyuki; Sadamoto, Sota; Wakayama, Megumi; Takahashi, Yukitoshi; Iwasaki, Yasuo; Shibuya, Kazutoshi; Urita, Yoshihisa","journal":"BMC Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb657ff6a2abb31f6e8c6c9ac91814cb8fcda133.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5286801.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28143446/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-017-0807-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease","report of Kikuchi","left cervical lymph node biopsy","painful testitis","brain biopsy","painful cervical lymphadenopathies","cervical lymphadenopathy","Encephalitis","irregular nuclei suggestive of Kikuchi","days","left temporal lobe","brain T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging","proven asymmetrical brain regions","intravenous immunoglobulin therapy","basal nuclei","pathological findings","intravenous prednisolone pulse therapy","complaints of fever","day of hospitalization","physical examination","cerebrospinal fluid examination","fever of unknown origin","apoptotic necrosis","paracortical","abundance of macrophages","cortical areas","large lymphoid cells","fatigue","high-signal intensities","headache","loss of consciousness","benign course","self-limited clinicopathologic entity","ultrasonography","lower quadrant pain","year-old man","antiviral drugs","sided orchitis","antibiotics","Neurologic involvement","young adults","differential diagnosis","BACKGROUND","CASE PRESENTATION","patient\u2019s symptoms","Meningitis","weeks","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

However, it is more appropriate to view the RAS in the contemporary notion as an \u201Cangiotensin-generating system\u201D, which consists of angiotensinogen, angiotensin-generating enzymes, and angiotensins, as well as their receptors. Some RASs can be termed as \u201Ccomplete\u201D, having renin and ACE involved in the biosynthesis of angiotensin II peptide, i.e. in a renin and/or ACE-dependent manner which is exemplified in the circulating RAS. On the other hand, some RAS can be termed as \u201Cpartial\u201D, having alternate enzymes to renin and ACE, such as chymase and ACE2 (see Section 4.3, Chapter 4) available for the generation of angiotensin II and other bioactive angiotensin peptides in the biosynthetic cascade, i.e. in a renin and/or ACE-independent manner. Complete vs. partial RASs can be exemplified in the so-called intrinsic angiotensin-generating system or local RAS; for example, a local and functional RAS with renin and ACE-dependent but a renin-independent pathway have been indentified in the pancreas and carotid body, respectively. In the past two decades, local RASs have gained increasing recognition especially with regards to their clinical importance. Distinct from the circulating RAS, these functional local RASs exist in such diverse tissues and organs as the pancreas, liver, intestine, heart, kidney, vasculature, carotid body, and adipose, as well as the nervous, reproductive, and digestive systems. Taken into previous findings from our laboratory and others together, Table 5.1 is a summary of some recently identified local RASs in various levels of tissues and organs.","publish_time":"2010-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Po Sing","journal":"The Renin-Angiotensin System: Current Research Progress in The Pancreas","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50b281ac00f308e55bc92cf330c098ccd8e610a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120160.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20700838/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9060-7_5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS","ACE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["circulating RAS","functional RAS","functional local RASs","generation of angiotensin","biosynthesis of angiotensin","partial RASs","ACE-dependent manner","renin-independent pathway","ACE-independent manner","bioactive angiotensin peptides","so-called intrinsic angiotensin","pancreas","Section","organs","carotid body","Chapter","diverse tissues","alternate enzymes","various levels of tissues","vasculature","kidney","heart","example","intestine","regulation of fluid homeostasis","liver","increasing recognition","biosynthetic cascade","regards","endocrine role","ACE2","decades","chymase","laboratory","digestive systems","angiotensins","summary","angiotensinogen","contemporary notion","clinical importance","previous findings","Table","concept","receptors","hand"],"language":"en"},

The burgeoning number of fish viruses is a reflection of the increased interest in fish diseases, particularly those occurring in aquaculture facilities, and the number will surely grow as fish farming intensifies on a global scale.

There are about 50 different breeds of domestic rabbits. Rabbits have very thin and delicate skin that is covered with fine fur comprised of both a soft undercoat and stiff guard hairs. Care must be taken when clipping fur because the skin is prone to tearing. A rabbit enclosure should be large enough to provide a sleeping space, eating space, and latrine. Animals housed for long periods of time should also have ample room to exercise. The enclosure should be tall enough to allow the rabbit to sit up and not have its ears touch the top of the cage. Because rabbits are prone to heatstroke, they should be housed in temperatures ranging from 60\u00B0F to 75\u00B0F. If rabbits are housed outdoors, they must have access to shade and clean water, and the shelter should protect them from the elements as well as from predators. The ideal substrate for rabbits is grass hay; however, for indoor, caged rabbits, a foam rubber pad or a towel covered with newspaper and a thick layer of timothy hay can also be used.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vennen, Kristine M.; Mitchell, Mark A.","journal":"Manual of Exotic Pet Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a856e19b6c14cf6cf82bcb7da8729dd2169acea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152457.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416001195500172; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781416001195500172","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["caged rabbits","medical care of rabbits","different breeds of domestic rabbits","rabbit enclosure","fine fur","sleeping space","delicate skin","thick layer of timothy hay","overview","foam rubber pad","soft undercoat","newspaper","towel","biology","clean water","long periods of time","chapter","stiff guard hairs","shelter","access","shade","Animals","Publisher Summary","ideal substrate","ample room","elements","latrine","heatstroke","ears","predators","temperatures"],"language":"en"},

Here, we present the first structure of a prokaryotic EndoU toxin in complex with its cognate immunity protein. The contact-dependent growth inhibition toxin CdiA-CT(STECO31) from Escherichia coli STEC_O31 adopts the eukaryotic EndoU fold and shares greatest structural homology with the nuclease domain of coronavirus Nsp15. The toxin contains a canonical His-His-Lys catalytic triad in the same arrangement as eukaryotic EndoU domains, but lacks the uridylate-specific ribonuclease activity that characterizes the superfamily. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that bacterial EndoU domains segregate into at least three major clades based on structural variations in the N-terminal subdomain. Representative EndoU nucleases from clades I and II degrade tRNA molecules with little specificity. In contrast, CdiA-CT(STECO31) and other clade III toxins are specific anticodon nucleases that cleave tRNA(Glu) between nucleotides C37 and m(2)A38. These findings suggest that the EndoU fold is a versatile scaffold for the evolution of novel substrate specificities. Such functional plasticity may account for the widespread use of EndoU effectors by diverse inter-bacterial toxin delivery systems.","publish_time":"2018-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michalska, Karolina; Nhan, Dinh Quan; Willett, Julia L.

Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) are formed on QCM gold electrodes to provide a surface amenable for the immobilization of anti-influenza A antibodies using NHS/EDC coupling chemistry. The surface-bound antibody provides a selective and specific sensing interface for the capture of influenza virions. A nebulizer is used to create aerosolized samples and is directly connected to a chamber housing the antibody-modified crystal (\u201Cimmunochip\u201D). Upon exposure to the aerosolized virus, the interaction between the antibody and virus leads to a dampening of the oscillation frequency of the quartz crystal. The magnitude of frequency change is directly related to virus concentration. Control experiments using aerosols from chicken egg allantoic fluid and an anti-murine antibody based immunosensor confirm that the observed signal originates from specific viral binding on the chip surface.

Currently Cyprus is undergoing a major reform, namely the introduction of a primary care driven national healthcare system. The aim of the study was to assess the existing state of training, support, quality, guidelines and infrastructure towards a better healthcare system in Cyprus. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods study combining statistical data until October 2016 and workshop discussions delivered in Cyprus in November 2015. We used anonymised data provided: (1a) by the Cyprus Medical Association of all registered medical doctors up to October 2016; (1b); by the Ministry of Health (MoH) Health Monitoring Unit up to October 2016; (2) during a workshop organised with representatives from the Royal College of Physicians, the European Commission and the Health Insurance Organization. RESULTS: The gender ratio of men over women is disproportionate, with over 85% of the medical doctors undertaking their training in Greece, Eastern Europe and neighbouring countries, while the current record does not hold a relevant specialty information for 4 out of 10 doctors. The results show lack of statutory inspection systems, application of revalidation principles or implementation of peer-review clinical services on the island. There are eight proposed recommendations made by the workshop participants towards the transformation of the Cypriot healthcare system and the development of the Cyprus Quality Improvement Institute. These are aimed at addressing gaps in quality of care, adherence to clinical guidelines and implementation of audits, development of doctors\u2019 revalidation and peer-review of clinical services, accreditation of service implementation, establishment of a statutory inspection system as well as the set-up of an incentives program as part of the general healthcare system (GHS) of Cyprus. CONCLUSIONS: Current efforts for the implementation of the new GHS in Cyprus call for adequate training and support of the medical workforce, transparent and safer quality of care provision through the implementation of clinical guidelines and capacity-building infrastructure.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pallari, Elena; Samoutis, George; Rudd, Anthony","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5b1a042d7828891177203755e2201748eec0a14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7137859.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32264910/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-5048-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Commission","GHS"],"locations":["Republic","Cyprus","European Union","Greece","Eastern Europe"],"keyphrases":["Republic of Cyprus","Cypriot healthcare system","Cyprus Medical Association","implementation of clinical guidelines","general healthcare system","national healthcare system","better healthcare system","implementation of peer","Cyprus Quality Improvement Institute","implementation of audits","clinical services","registered medical doctors","medical workforce","accreditation of service implementation","safer quality of care provision","support","adequate training","primary care","Ministry of Health","infrastructure","peer-review","workshop participants","RESULTS","workshop discussions","development of doctors\u2019 revalidation","existing state of training","Health Insurance Organization","Health Monitoring Unit","mixed-methods study","lack of statutory inspection systems","European Commission","European Union","new GHS","current record","statistical data","Current efforts","major reform","anonymised data","application of revalidation principles","number of major transformations","Greece","neighbouring countries","establishment","adherence","Royal College of Physicians","Eastern Europe","introduction","MoH","induction","gender ratio of men","women","representatives","set-up","capacity","incentives program","relevant specialty information","proposed recommendations","CONCLUSIONS","gaps","BACKGROUND","years","island","aim"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, discovering additional therapeutic options would be a valuable aid to public health. Recently, TLR4 inhibition has emerged as a possible mechanism for protection against influenza-associated lethality and acute lung injury. Based on recent data showing that rhesus macaque \u03B8-defensins could inhibit TLR4-dependent gene expression, we tested the hypothesis that a novel \u03B8-defensin, retrocyclin (RC)-101, could disrupt TLR4-dependent signaling and protect against viral infection. In this study, RC-101, a variant of the humanized \u03B8-defensin RC-1, blocked TLR4-mediated gene expression in mouse and human macrophages in response to LPS, targeting both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways. In a cell-free assay, RC-101 neutralized the biologic activity of LPS at doses ranging from 0.5 to 50 EU/ml, consistent with data showing that RC-101 binds biotinylated LPS. The action of RC-101 was not limited to the TLR4 pathway because RC-101 treatment of macrophages also inhibited gene expression in response to a TLR2 agonist, Pam3CSK4, but failed to bind that biotinylated agonist. Mouse macrophages infected in vitro with mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 influenza A virus (PR8) also produced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene products in a TLR4-independent fashion when treated with RC-101. Finally, RC-101 decreased both the lethality and clinical severity associated with PR8 infection in mice. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate that RC-101 exhibits therapeutic potential for the mitigation of influenza-related morbidity and mortality, potentially acting through TLR-dependent and TLR-independent mechanisms.","publish_time":"2017-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prantner, Daniel; Shirey, Kari Ann; Lai, Wendy; Lu, Wuyuan; Cole, Alexander M.; Vogel, Stefanie N.; Garzino-Demo, Alfredo","journal":"Journal of Leukocyte Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/757a89f247aa8746b8b2a661a073e401abd8a280.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5597516.xml.json","url":"https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1189/jlb.2A1215-567RR; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729359/; https://doi.org/10.1189/jlb.2a1215-567rr","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["action of RC","TLR4-dependent gene expression","humanized \u03B8-defensin RC","TLR4 inhibition","TLR4 pathway","influenza-associated lethality","mitigation of influenza","blocked TLR4-mediated gene expression","Mouse macrophages","TLR4-independent fashion","TLR-dependent","biotinylated LPS","seasonal influenza-associated deaths number","response","human macrophages","novel \u03B8-defensin","treatment of macrophages","mouse-adapted","PR8 infection","TRIF-dependent pathways","recent data","biotinylated agonist","widespread use of annual influenza vaccines","TLR-independent mechanisms","biologic activity of LPS","lower levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene products","rhesus macaque \u03B8-defensins","therapeutic potential","TLR2 agonist","viral infection","additional therapeutic options","valuable aid","possible mechanism","MyD88","protection","hypothesis","acute lung injury","clinical severity","year","doses","thousands","related morbidity","mortality","virus","retrocyclin","variant","public health","mice","Pam3CSK4","cell-free assay","bacterial superinfections","study"],"language":"en"},

Materials and methods We retrospectively examined 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and through an in-house computer software. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist, as follows, for each of the 5 lung lobes: 0, no lesion present; 1, \u003C1/3 involvement; 2, \u003E1/3 and \u003C 2/3 involvement; and 3, \u003E2/3 involvement. Lesion density was assessed based on the proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and fibrosis of the lesions. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included lung volume (mL), lesion volume (mL), lesion percentage (%), and mean lesion density (HU) of the whole lung, right lung, left lung, and each lobe. The scores obtained by the radiologists and quantitative results generated by the computer software were tested for correlation. A Chi-square test was used to test the consistency of radiologist- and computer-derived lesion percentage in the right/left lung, upper/lower lobe, and each of the 5 lobes. Result The results showed a strong to moderate correlation between lesion percentage scores obtained by radiologists and the computer software (r ranged from 0.7679 to 0.8373, P \u003C 0.05), and a moderate correlation between the proportion of GGO and mean lesion density (r = \u22120.5894, P \u003C 0.05), and proportion of consolidation and mean lesion density (r = 0.6282, P \u003C 0.05). Computer-aided quantification showed a statistical significant higher lesion percentage for lower lobes than that assessed by the radiologists (\u03C72 = 8.160, P = 0.004). Conclusions Our experiments demonstrated that the computer tool could reliably and accurately assess the severity and distribution of pneumonia on CT scans.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Cong; Yu, Nan; Cai, Shubo; Zhou, Jie; Sheng, Jiexin; Liu, Kang; Zhou, Heping; Guo, Youmin; Niu, Gang","journal":"J Pharm Anal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e456188cd68fbdcc7bd6dc7fd34f26cb89634c3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102584.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095177920302264; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292624/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095177920302264","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lesion volume","computer-derived lesion percentage","mean lesion density","lesion present","computer tool","lesion percentage scores","lung lobes","left lung","right lung","lung volume","in-house computer software","radiologists","statistical significant higher lesion percentage","Computer-aided quantification","involvement","proportion of GGO","proportion of consolidation","moderate correlation","lower lobes","proportion of ground","cases","quantitative results","CT scans","confirmed COVID","consistency of radiologist","degree of lesions","Chi-square test","severity of Coronavirus Disease","glass opacity","distribution of pneumonia","feasibility","HU","computed tomography","methods","images","fibrosis","experiments","Abstract Purpose","Conclusions","\u03C72","parameters","Materials"],"language":"en"},

During entry, viruses or virus-containing vesicles can fuse with endosomal membranes to mediate the cytosolic release of virions, and alterations in endosomal cholesterol can inhibit this invasion step. We show that the antiviral effector protein Interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) interacts with VAPA and prevents its association with OSBP, thereby disrupting intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and inhibiting viral entry. By altering VAPA-OSBP function, IFITM3 induces a marked accumulation of cholesterol in multivesicular bodies and late endosomes, which inhibits the fusion of intraluminal virion-containing vesicles with endosomal membranes and thereby blocks virus release into the cytosol. Consequently, ectopic expression or depletion of the VAPA gene profoundly affects IFITM3-mediated inhibition of viral entry. Thus, IFITM3 disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis to block viral entry, further underscoring the importance of cholesterol in virus infection.","publish_time":"2013-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amini-Bavil-Olyaee, Samad; Choi, Youn Jung; Lee, Jun Han; Shi, Mude; Huang, I-Chueh; Farzan, Michael; Jung, Jae U.","journal":"Cell Host \u0026 Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc19eacaca1d55dcb90daf388ffbc0d15b4f5363.json; document_parses/pdf_json/49daf278f5a58c4d7381c543420a623c7870333a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3c6ba8584af46d9de5f9a761a7ab3e32fb78fad0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3646482.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2013.03.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312813001169; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312813001169; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312813001169/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23601107/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VAPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endosomal cholesterol","intracellular cholesterol homeostasis","protein-associated protein","importance of cholesterol","virus release","marked accumulation of cholesterol","VAPA-OSBP function","IFITM3-mediated inhibition of viral entry","VAPA gene","endosomal membranes","virus infections","oxysterol-binding protein","antiviral effector protein Interferon-inducible transmembrane protein","vesicles","cytosolic release of virions","multivesicular bodies","late endosomes","alterations","fusion of intraluminal virion","depletion","ectopic expression","Vesicle-membrane","invasion step","viruses","association"],"language":"en"},

Cardiac repair is dependent on regulatory mechanisms that suppress inflammation and prevent excessive matrix degradation. Chemokine induction in the infarcted heart mediates recruitment of leukocyte subsets with distinct properties. We demonstrate that signaling through the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) prevents uncontrolled postinfarction inflammation and protects from adverse remodeling by recruiting suppressive mononuclear cells. CCR5 and its ligands macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)\u22121\u03B1 and MIP-1\u03B2 were markedly induced in the infarcted mouse myocardium. In addition, almost 40% of the mononuclear cells infiltrating the infarct expressed CCR5. CCR5(\u2212/\u2212) mice exhibited marked upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in the infarct. In wild-type infarcts CCR5(\u002B) mononuclear cells had anti-inflammatory properties, expressing higher levels of IL-10 than CCR5(\u2212) cells. In contrast, mononuclear cells isolated from CCR5(\u2212/\u2212) infarcts had reduced IL-10 expression. Moreover, enhanced inflammation in the absence of CCR5 was associated with impaired recruitment of CD4(\u002B)/foxp3(\u002B) regulatory T cells (Tregs). The CCR5(\u002B) Treg subset exhibited increased IL-10 expression, reflecting potent anti-inflammatory activity. Accentuated inflammation in CCR5(\u2212/\u2212) infarcts was associated with increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, reduced TIMP levels, and enhanced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, resulting in worse cardiac dilation. These results suggest that CCR5-mediated Treg recruitment may restrain postinfarction inflammation, preventing excessive matrix degradation and attenuating adverse remodeling.","publish_time":"2010-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dobaczewski, Marcin; Xia, Ying; Bujak, Marcin; Gonzalez-Quesada, Carlos; Frangogiannis, Nikolaos G.","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7266e2032c3645066c7ba0e7f9cfb389236b95ec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/16d2130aa50aa20e39d9302cf7717fb480d7c3da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2861083.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2353/ajpath.2010.090759; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944010600144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20382703/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944010600144","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["absence of CCR5","CCR5-mediated Treg recruitment","wild-type infarcts CCR5","suppressive mononuclear cells","chemokine expression","enhanced inflammation","Accentuated inflammation","regulatory T cells","cardiac remodeling","uncontrolled postinfarction inflammation","enhanced MMP","adverse remodeling","increased IL","excessive matrix degradation","increased matrix metalloproteinase","MIP","anti-inflammatory properties","higher levels of IL","Chemokine induction","Cardiac repair","recruitment of leukocyte subsets","reduced TIMP levels","impaired recruitment of CD4","CC chemokine receptor","potent anti-inflammatory activity","worse cardiac dilation","infarcted heart","regulatory mechanisms","Treg subset","inflammatory reaction","distinct properties","infarcted mouse myocardium","ligands macrophage inflammatory protein","marked upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine","mice","foxp3","Myocardial infarction","Tregs","results","contrast","addition"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: Determine whether medical mask use by sick individuals with ILI protects well contacts from related respiratory infections. SETTING: 6 major hospitals in 2 districts of Beijing, China. DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: 245 index cases with ILI. INTERVENTION: Index cases with ILI were randomly allocated to medical mask (n=123) and control arms (n=122). Since 43 index cases in the control arm also used a mask during the study period, an as-treated post hoc analysis was performed by comparing outcomes among household members of index cases who used a mask (mask group) with household members of index cases who did not use a mask (no-mask group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcomes measured in household members were clinical respiratory illness, ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, rates of clinical respiratory illness (relative risk (RR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.13), ILI (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.13) and laboratory-confirmed viral infections (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.54) were consistently lower in the mask arm compared with control, although not statistically significant. A post hoc comparison between the mask versus no-mask groups showed a protective effect against clinical respiratory illness, but not against ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates a potential benefit of medical masks for source control, but is limited by small sample size and low secondary attack rates. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy of medical masks as source control.

The host density threshold is a central concept in theoretical epidemiology and a common target of human and wildlife disease control programmes, but there is mixed evidence supporting the existence of thresholds, especially in wildlife populations or for pathogens with complex transmission modes (e.g. environmental transmission). Here, we demonstrate the existence of a host density threshold for an environmentally transmitted pathogen by combining an epidemiological model with a microcosm experiment. Experimental epidemics consisted of replicate populations of naive crustacean zooplankton (Daphnia dentifera) hosts across a range of host densities (20\u2013640 hosts l(\u22121)) that were exposed to an environmentally transmitted fungal pathogen (Metschnikowia bicuspidata). Epidemiological model simulations, parametrized independently of the experiment, qualitatively predicted experimental pathogen invasion thresholds. Variability in parameter estimates did not strongly influence outcomes, though systematic changes to key parameters have the potential to shift pathogen invasion thresholds. In summary, we provide one of the first clear experimental demonstrations of pathogen invasion thresholds in a replicated experimental system, and provide evidence that such thresholds may be predictable using independently constructed epidemiological models.","publish_time":"2018-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dallas, Tad A.; Krko\u0161ek, Martin; Drake, John M.","journal":"R Soc Open Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10dab751e09a2f4ef5a81f68b82c76c8be09343f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/afa0cf3bd7286376ed6c62033c05a5b6d9e4211f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5792953.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.171975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29410876/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["experimental pathogen invasion thresholds","Host density thresholds","transmitted pathogen","existence of thresholds","clear experimental demonstrations of pathogen invasion thresholds","transmitted fungal pathogen","Experimental epidemics","pathogen invasion separate regions of parameter space corresponding","wildlife populations","replicated experimental system","hosts","range of host densities","Epidemiological model simulations","epidemiological models","environmental transmission","parameter estimates","mixed evidence","microcosm experiment","complex transmission modes","wildlife disease control programmes","replicate populations of naive crustacean zooplankton","common target of human","Daphnia dentifera","central concept","theoretical epidemiology","potential","outcomes","key parameters","pathogens","systematic changes","disease-free states","Metschnikowia bicuspidata","Variability","summary"],"language":"en"},

The recent identification of two influenza-like virus genomes (designated H17N10 and H18N11) from bats has challenged this notion.

Structural and functional studies of the two major surface envelope proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), demonstrate that neither has canonical HA or NA functions found in influenza viruses. However, putative functional modules and domains in other encoded proteins are conserved, and the N-terminal domain of the H17N10 polymerase subunit PA has a classical structure and function. Therefore, potential genomic reassortments of such influenza-like viruses with canonical influenza viruses cannot be excluded at this point and should be assessed.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Ying; Wu, Yan; Tefsen, Boris; Shi, Yi; Gao, George F.","journal":"Trends in Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8803043db2c0ea551fcf492d6e4da1e762f4f6cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127364.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2014.01.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X14000225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582528/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X14000225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA","PA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["canonical influenza viruses","influenza virus ecology","canonical HA","designated H17N10","role bats","virus genomes","functional studies","encoded proteins","NA functions","putative functional modules","H17N10 polymerase subunit PA","major surface envelope proteins","hemagglutinin","classical structure","N-terminal domain","domains","H18N11","swine","reservoir hosts","potential genomic reassortments","crucial question","neuraminidase","recent identification","waterfowls","mixing vessels","Shorebirds","notion","point"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we analyzed three new norovirus-specific Nanobodies that interacted with the prototype human norovirus (i.e., genogroup I genotype 1 [GI.1]). We showed that the Nanobodies bound on the side (Nano-7 and Nano-62) and top (Nano-94) of the capsid-protruding (P) domain using X-ray crystallography. Nano-7 and Nano-62 bound at a similar region on the P domain, but the orientations of these two Nanobodies clashed with the shell (S) domain and neighboring P domains on intact particles. This finding suggested that the P domains on the particles should shift in order for Nano-7 and Nano-62 to bind to intact particles. Interestingly, both Nano-7 and Nano-94 were capable of blocking norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) from binding to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), which are important cofactors for norovirus infection. Previously, we showed that the GI.1 HBGA pocket could be blocked with the soluble human milk oligosaccharide 2-fucosyllactose (2\u2032FL). In the current study, we showed that a combined treatment of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2\u2032FL enhanced the blocking potential with an additive (Nano-7) or synergistic (Nano-94) effect. We also found that GII Nanobodies with 2\u2032FL also enhanced inhibition. The Nanobody inhibition likely occurred by different mechanisms, including particle aggregation or particle disassembly, whereas 2\u2032FL blocked the HBGA binding site. Overall, these new data showed that the positive effect of the addition of 2\u2032FL was not limited to a single mode of action of Nanobodies or to a single norovirus genogroup. IMPORTANCE The discovery of vulnerable regions on norovirus particles is instrumental in the development of effective inhibitors, particularly for GI noroviruses that are genetically diverse. Analysis of these GI.1-specific Nanobodies has shown that similar to GII norovirus particles, the GI particles have vulnerable regions. The only known cofactor region, the HBGA binding pocket, represents the main target for inhibition. With a combination treatment, i.e., the addition of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2\u2032FL, the effect of inhibition was increased. Therefore, combination drug treatments might offer a better approach to combat norovirus infections, especially since the GI genotypes are highly diverse and are continually changing the capsid landscape, and few conserved epitopes have so far been identified.","publish_time":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruoff, Kerstin; Kilic, Turgay; Devant, Jessica; Koromyslova, Anna; Ringel, Alessa; Hempelmann, Alexander; Geiss, Celina; Graf, Juliane; Haas, Michelle; Roggenbach, Imme; Hansman, Grant","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/103497533321c2f879138d46b60ae87cd2fb74cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6401464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30602609/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02005-18","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBGA","GII Nanobodies"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["addition of Nano","GI particles","GII norovirus particles","FL","combined treatment of Nano","new norovirus-specific Nanobodies","Human norovirus infections","intact particles","prototype human norovirus","single norovirus genogroup","combat norovirus infections","GII Nanobodies","GI noroviruses","GI genotypes","effect of inhibition","capable of blocking norovirus virus","HBGA binding pocket","HBGA pocket","Nanobody inhibition","neighboring P domains","HBGA binding site","similar region","positive effect","combination treatment","discovery of vulnerable regions","particle aggregation","particle disassembly","soluble human milk oligosaccharide","blocking potential","capsid-protruding","capsid landscape","new data","current study","known cofactor region","single mode of action","combination drug treatments","better approach","HBGAs","different mechanisms","histo-blood group antigens","development of effective inhibitors","fucosyllactose","VLPs","major disease burden","main target","important cofactors","shell","X-ray crystallography","conserved epitopes","IMPORTANCE","additive","orientations","order","Analysis"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a 3-year prospective AFI study in Puerto Rico. Patients with fever \u22647 days were offered enrollment, and clinical data and specimens were collected at enrollment and upon discharge or follow-up. Blood and oro-nasopharyngeal specimens were tested by RT-PCR and immunodiagnostic methods for infection with dengue viruses (DENV) 1\u20134, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), influenza A and B viruses (FLU A/B), 12 other respiratory viruses (ORV), enterovirus, Leptospira spp., and Burkholderia pseudomallei. Clinical presentation and laboratory findings of participants infected with DENV were compared to those infected with CHIKV, FLU A/B, and ORV. Clinical predictors of laboratory-positive dengue compared to all other AFI etiologies were determined by age and day post-illness onset (DPO) at presentation. Of 8,996 participants enrolled from May 7, 2012 through May 6, 2015, more than half (54.8%, 4,930) had a pathogen detected. Pathogens most frequently detected were CHIKV (1,635, 18.2%), FLU A/B (1,074, 11.9%), DENV 1\u20134 (970, 10.8%), and ORV (904, 10.3%). Participants with DENV infection presented later and a higher proportion were hospitalized than those with other diagnoses (46.7% versus 27.3% with ORV, 18.8% with FLU A/B, and 11.2% with CHIKV).

Predictors of dengue in participants presenting 3\u20135 DPO were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, facial/neck erythema, nausea, eye pain, signs of poor circulation, and diarrhea; presence of rhinorrhea, cough, and red conjunctiva predicted non-dengue AFI. By enrolling febrile patients at clinical presentation, we identified unbiased predictors of laboratory-positive dengue as compared to other common causes of AFI. These findings can be used to assist in early identification of dengue patients, as well as direct anticipatory guidance and timely initiation of correct clinical management.","publish_time":"2017-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomashek, Kay M.; Lorenzi, Olga D.; And\u00FAjar-P\u00E9rez, Doris A.; Torres-Vel\u00E1squez, Brenda C.; Hunsperger, Elizabeth A.; Munoz-Jordan, Jorge Luis; Perez-Padilla, Janice; Rivera, Aidsa; Gonzalez-Zeno, Gladys E.; Sharp, Tyler M.; Galloway, Renee L.; Glass Elrod, Mindy; Mathis, Demetrius L.; Oberste, M.

Owing to the pressure of natural evolution and human exploration, some of these viruses may be able to invade human beings. If their \u2018fresh\u2019 host had no defences, the viruses could cause a serious pandemic, as seen with HIV, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and avian influenza virus that originated from chimpanzees, the common palm civet and birds, respectively. It is unknown whether the human immune system could tolerate invasion with a plant virus. To model such an alien virus invasion, we chose TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) and used human epithelial carcinoma cells (HeLa cells) as its \u2018fresh\u2019 host. We established a reliable system for transfecting TMV-RNA into HeLa cells and found that TMV-RNA triggered autophagy in HeLa cells as shown by the appearance of autophagic vacuoles, the conversion of LC3-I (light chain protein 3-I) to LC3-II, the up-regulated expression of Beclin1 and the accumulation of TMV protein on autophagosomal membranes. We observed suspected TMV virions in HeLa cells by TEM (transmission electron microscopy). Furthermore, we found that TMV-RNA was translated into CP (coat protein) in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and that TMV-positive RNA translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus. Finally, we detected greatly increased expression of GRP78 (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein), a typical marker of ERS (ER stress) and found that the formation of autophagosomes was closely related to the expanded ER membrane. Taken together, our data indicate that HeLa cells used ERS and ERS-related autophagy to defend against TMV-RNA.","publish_time":"2011-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Li; Wang, Li; Xiao, Ruijing; Zhu, Guoguo; Li, Yan; Liu, Changxuan; Yang, Ru; Tang, Zhiqing; Li, Jie; Huang, Wei; Chen, Lang; Zheng, Xiaoling; He, Yuling; Tan, Jinquan","journal":"Biosci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80a789fb3ed3279911f241585e315718b54c9a91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3225954.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21729006/; https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20110069","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HeLa","ERS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HeLa cells","transfecting TMV-RNA","TMV-positive RNA","ability of human cells","accumulation of TMV protein","human epithelial carcinoma cells","suspected TMV virions","human exploration","human beings","viruses","human immune system","coat protein","plant virus","alien virus invasion","ERS-related autophagy","avian influenza virus","kDa glucose-regulated protein","tobacco mosaic virus","light chain protein","ER stress","host","typical marker of ERS","regulated expression of Beclin1","expanded ER membrane","reliable system","conversion of LC3","increased expression of GRP78","severe acute respiratory syndrome","HIV","chimpanzees","SARS","transmission electron microscopy","appearance of autophagic vacuoles","common palm civet","pressure of natural evolution","autophagosomal membranes","endoplasmic reticulum","CP","birds","serious pandemic","cytoplasm","defences","data","formation of autophagosomes","distant species","nucleolus"],"language":"en"},

Hospitals in developed countries offering specialist reconstructive or tertiary services are not infrequently asked to accept civilian patients from overseas conflict for complex surgical procedures or rehabilitation. Concern about the infection prevention and control risks posed by these patients, and the lack of a good evidence base on which to base measured precautions, means that the precautionary principle of accepting zero risk is usually followed. The aim of this article is to highlight infection control considerations that may be required when treating casualties from overseas conflict, based partly on our own experience. Currently there is a lack of published evidence and national consensus on how to manage these patients. The precautionary principle requires that there is an ongoing search for evidence and knowledge that can be used to move towards more traditional risk management. We propose that only by gathering the experiences of the many individual hospitals that have each cared for small numbers of such patients can such evidence and knowledge be assimilated.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morton, H.; Gray, J.","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48161cd54196700f67b479eb52879805f2d6bca0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134502.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26002183/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670115001759; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2015.03.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670115001759","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overseas conflict","civilian patients","lack of published evidence","good evidence base","casualties of global conflict","precautionary principle","knowledge","infection control considerations","control risks","individual hospitals","infection prevention","non-governmental circles","traditional risk management","media attention","specialist reconstructive","public","sympathy","complex surgical procedures","developed countries","tertiary services","national consensus","rehabilitation","article","small numbers","measured precautions","ongoing search","Concern","Summary","experiences","aim"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in Qatar. A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP. Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%). Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT). The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT. Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT. All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63). Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT. In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21). The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays.","publish_time":"2019-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al Kahlout, Reham A.; Nasrallah, Gheyath K.; Farag, Elmoubasher A.; Wang, Lingshu; Lattwein, Erik; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; El Zowalaty, Mohamed E.; Al Romaihi, Hamad E.; Graham, Barney S.; Al Thani, Asmaa A.; Yassine, Hadi M.","journal":"J Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44eb5c174b0fe94bde674772bebd4312af33b355.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6398027.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/1386740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CC","BD","SARS"],"locations":["Middle East","Qatar"],"keyphrases":["reactive samples","IgG-IIFT","virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG","prevalence of MERS","negative BD samples","seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies","CoV infections","CP","low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies","IgG rS1-ELISA kit","selected IgG rS1-ELISA","IgM-IIFT","CC","ppNT","Initial screening","considerable reactivity","observed cross-reactivity","low number","general population","reported cases","study","Qatar","circulating human coronaviruses","low-risk groups","positive PCR","epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases","performance of various serological assays","detailed evaluation of available serological assays","false-positive results","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","OC43","indirect immunefluorescent tests","HKU1","individuals","pseudoparticle neutralization test","close contact","baseline case contacts","healthy blood donors","active surveillance","mild influenza","period","time","patients","SARS","illness","NL63","conclusion","years","aim","total"],"language":"en"},

Deafness and vestibular dysfunction in the corresponding mouse model, Slc26a4(\u2212/\u2212), are associated with an enlargement and acidification of the membranous labyrinth. Here we relate the onset of expression of the HCO(3) (\u2212) transporter pendrin to the luminal pH and to enlargement-associated epithelial cell stretching. We determined expression with immunocytochemistry, cell stretching by digital morphometry and pH with double-barreled ion-selective electrodes. Pendrin was first expressed in the endolymphatic sac at embryonic day (E) 11.5, in the cochlear hook-region at E13.5, in the utricle and saccule at E14.5, in ampullae at E16.5, and in the upper turn of the cochlea at E17.5. Epithelial cell stretching in Slc26a4(\u2212/\u2212) mice began at E14.5. pH changes occurred first in the cochlea at E15.5 and in the endolymphatic sac at E17.5. At postnatal day 2, stria vascularis, outer sulcus and Reissner\u0027s membrane epithelial cells, and utricular and saccular transitional cells were stretched, whereas sensory cells in the cochlea, utricle and saccule did not differ between Slc26a4(\u002B/\u2212) and Slc26a4(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Structural development of stria vascularis, including vascularization, was retarded in Slc26a4(\u2212/\u2212) mice. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that the enlargement and stretching of non-sensory epithelial cells precedes luminal acidification in the cochlea and the endolymphatic sac. Stretching and luminal acidification may alter cell-to-cell communication and lead to the observed retarded development of stria vascularis, which may be an important step on the path to deafness in Slc26a4(\u2212/\u2212) mice, and possibly in humans, lacking functional pendrin expression.","publish_time":"2011-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyoung-Mi; Wangemann, Philine","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c24af6314214e7d2ef8b04419efccd6f7f900858.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3056798.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423764/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mice","sensory cells","luminal pH","luminal acidification","cell communication","enlargement","endolymphatic sac","function mutations of SLC26A4","non-sensory epithelial cells","functional pendrin expression","Reissner\u0027s membrane epithelial cells","transporter pendrin","Structural development of stria vascularis","observed retarded development of stria vascularis","saccular transitional cells","pH changes","utricle","E17","saccule","onset of expression","E14","prevalent causes of deafness","embryonic day","postnatal day","outer sulcus","utricular","digital morphometry","corresponding mouse model","vestibular dysfunction","double-barreled ion-selective electrodes","lead","E13","immunocytochemistry","path","humans","vascularization","important step","cochlear hook-region","upper turn","membranous labyrinth","Loss","ampullae","HCO","data","E15","E16","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

If in English, abstracts were assessed individually for their relevance and included in the report. Members of the panel drafted the report based on these searches and on new data presented at the 20th International Symposium on Recent Advances in Otitis Media. Conclusions The main themes that arose in OM pathogenesis were around the need for symptomatic viral infections to develop disease. Different populations potentially having different mechanisms of pathogenesis. Novel bacterial otopathogens are emerging and need to be monitored. Animal models need to continue to be developed and used to understand disease pathogenesis. Implications for Practice The findings in the pathogenesis panel have several implications for both research and clinical practice. The most urgent areas appear to be to continue monitoring the emergence of novel otopathogens, and the need to develop prevention and preventative therapies that do not rely on antibiotics and protect against the development of the initial OM episode.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thornton, R.

However, many efforts have failed to identify a potentially universal trigger of KS. The contribution of the intestinal microbial community\u2014called the \u201Cmicrobiota\u201D\u2014to KS has been evaluated by an increasing number of studies, though limited to small cohorts of patients. Differences in the microbiota composition were found in children with KS, both its acute and non-acute phase, with abnormal colonization by Streptococcus species in the intestinal tract and a wider presence of Gram-positive cocci in jejunal biopsies. In particular, a higher number of Gram-positive cocci (of the genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus), Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and HSP60-producing Gram-negative microbes have been found in the stools of KS children, and their effects on the antigenic repertoire of specific T cells and V\u03B22 T cell expansion have been assessed. Conversely, Lactobacilli were lacking in most children with KS compared with other febrile illnesses and healthy controls. All studies available to date have confirmed that an imbalance in the gut microbiota might indirectly interfere with the normal function of innate and adaptive immunity, and that variable microbiota interactions with environmental factors, mainly infectious agents, might selectively drive the development of KS in genetically susceptible children. Further investigations of the intestinal microflora in larger cohorts of KS patients will provide clues to disentangle the pathogenesis of this disease and probably indicate disease-modifying agents or more rational KS-specific therapies.","publish_time":"2019-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, Susanna; Polinori, Ilaria; Rigante, Donato","journal":"Front Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0713cd16ef0d30221483b314837bcf9e642a884.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6460951.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2019.00124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of KS","stools of KS children","universal trigger of KS","larger cohorts of KS patients","rational KS-specific therapies","susceptible children","microbiota composition","gut microbiota","infectious disease","intestinal tract","intestinal microflora","variable microbiota interactions","small cohorts of patients","infectious agents","higher number of Gram-positive cocci","intestinal microbial community","increasing number of studies","wider presence of Gram-positive cocci","Streptococcus species","genera Streptococcus","studies available","antigenic repertoire of specific T cells","non-acute phase","necrotizing vasculitis of small","V\u03B22 T cell expansion","adaptive immunity","abnormal colonization","environmental factors","host of clinical","Eubacterium","epidemiological data","medium-sized vessels","effects","jejunal biopsies","febrile illnesses","normal function of innate","HSP60","Peptostreptococcus","Staphylococcus","years of age","notion","clues","Gram-negative microbes","healthy controls","date","contribution","investigations","imbalance","Kawasaki syndrome","pathogenesis","Differences","Lactobacilli","efforts"],"language":"en"},

In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics. This review will discuss the status of influenza therapeutics including the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil after its first year of clinical use and evaluate a subset of direct-acting antiviral candidates in different stages of preclinical and clinical development.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toots, Mart; Plemper, Richard K.","journal":"Transl Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce6133dcbb5290e0cb38fff1c47c23545512f190.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102518.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32088166/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931524420300189; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2020.01.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931524420300189","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral resistance","Influenza viruses","status of influenza therapeutics","antiviral therapeutics","new influenza drug class","viral dissemination","viral replication","generation influenza virus therapeutics","treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza","viral polymerase complex","pre-existing resistance","clinical development","resistance problem","human use","year of clinical use","antiviral candidates","drug classes","complicated disease","disease management","important component","important objective","resistant viruses","human health","PA endonuclease subunit","endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil","different stages of preclinical","advance","current intervention strategy","circulating strains","vaccine prophylaxis","subset of direct","neuraminidase inhibitors","major threat","decades","case-fatality rates","care","genetic barrier","addition","Standard","review"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The clinical and immunological data of four patients diagnosed with combined immunodeficiency (CID) from two related Saudi families were collected. Autozygosity mapping of all available members and whole exome sequencing of the index case were performed to define the genetic etiology. Results: The patients had early onset (2\u20134 months of age) severe infections caused by viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. They all had hypogammaglobulinemia and low absolute lymphocyte count. Their lymphocytes failed to respond to PHA mitogen stimulation. A novel homozygous non-sense mutation in the IKBKB gene, c.850C\u003ET (p. Arg284*) was identified in the index patient and segregated with the disease in the rest of the family. He underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a fully matched sibling with no conditioning. The other three patients succumbed to their disease.

In addition, once in the cell, further hurdles have to be overcome, including DNA degradation, nuclear import and the ability to maintain long-term transgene expression. Strategies to overcome these barriers will be addressed in this review and include the use of: (i) clinically relevant adjuncts to overcome the extra- and intracellular barriers; (ii) less-conventional delivery routes, such as intravenous or in utero administration; (iii) more efficient non-viral vectors and \u2018stealth\u2019 viruses which can be re-administered; and (iv) new approaches to prolong transgene expression by means of alternative promoters or integrating vectors.

Patients with SARS also suffered from cardiac disease including arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Materials and methods We studied mice infected with the human strain of the SARS\u2010CoV and encephalomyocarditis virus and examined ACE2 mRNA and protein expression. Autopsy heart samples from patients who succumbed to the SARS crisis in Toronto (Canada) were used to investigate the impact of SARS on myocardial structure, inflammation and ACE2 protein expression. Results Pulmonary infection with the human SARS\u2010CoV in mice led to an ACE2\u2010dependent myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ACE2 expression confirming a critical role of ACE2 in mediating SARS\u2010CoV infection in the heart. The SARS\u2010CoV viral RNA was detected in 35% (7/20) of autopsied human heart samples obtained from patients who succumbed to the SARS crisis during the Toronto SARS outbreak.

This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. RESULTS: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3\u201316.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha- CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel bat-borne PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within European bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of bats and their habitats.","publish_time":"2017-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rizzo, Francesca; Edenborough, Kathryn M.; Toffoli, Roberto; Culasso, Paola; Zoppi, Simona; Dondo, Alessandro; Robetto, Serena; Rosati, Sergio; Lander, Angelika; Kurth, Andreas; Orusa, Riccardo; Bertolotti, Luigi; Mandola, Maria Lucia","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a03517f26664be79239bcdf3dbb0966913206a86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5741894.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1307-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29273042/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMV"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["new bat species","European bat species","different bat species","beta-CoVs","alpha- CoVs","report of CoVs","novel bat","current molecular bat","bats roost","new bat genetic sequences","unique report of PMVs","inter-species transmission risks","zoonotic potential","CoV RNA","optimal management of bats","potential threats","virus surveillance","divergent alpha-CoV clade","Pipistrellus","phylogenetic characterization","potential pathogens","PMV RNA","animals","study","knowledge","current viral sequence database","awareness of viral burden","definition of viral diversity","compact cluster of beta","unsurveyed Italian regions","northwest Italian regions","surveillance studies","PCR positive","virus databases","Family-wide PCR screenings","wide-range","emergence of zoonotic infections","public health","close proximity","ferrumequinum roosts","appropriate control measures","specific geographic area","spillover hosts","basis","years","Myotis nattereri SpA","conserved polymerase gene fragments","humans","RESULTS","Plecotus auritus","proven ability","oxygnathus","paramyxoviruses","overall detection rate","locations","habitats","Italy","coronaviruses","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","investigation","kuhlii"],"language":"en"},

The magnitude of the enthalpy of association changes with temperature according to the change in heat capacity (\u0394Cp) on GP/Cr binding, being little affected for avian influenza virus (AIV) haemagglutinin (HA) binding to SA (\u0394Cp = 0 kJ/mol/K) but greatly affected for HIV gp120 binding to CD4 receptor (\u0394Cp = \u22125.0 kJ/mol/K). A thermodynamic model developed here predicts that values of \u0394Cp from 0 to ~\u22122.0 kJ/mol/K have relatively little impact on the temperature sensitivity of the number of mosquito midgut cells with bound arbovirus, while intermediate values of \u0394Cp of ~\u22123.0 kJ/mol/K give a peak binding at a temperature of ~20 \u00B0C as observed experimentally for Western equine encephalitis virus. More negative values of \u0394Cp greatly decrease arbovirus binding at temperatures below ~20 \u00B0C. Thus to promote transmission at low temperatures, arboviruses may benefit from \u0394Cp ~ 0 kJ/mol/K as for HA/SA and it is interesting that bluetongue virus binds to SA in midge midguts. Large negative values of \u0394Cp as for HIV gp120:CD4 diminish binding at 37 \u00B0C. Of greater importance, however, is the decrease in entropy of the whole virus (\u0394Sa_immob) on its immobilisation on the host cell surface. \u0394Sa_immob presents a repulsive force which the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions weakened at higher temperatures struggle to overcome. \u0394Sa_immob is more negative (less favourable) for larger diameter viruses which therefore show diminished binding at higher temperatures than smaller viruses. It is proposed that small size phenotype through a less negative \u0394Sa_immob is selected for viruses infecting warmer hosts thus explaining the observation that virion volume decreases with increasing host temperature from 0 \u00B0C to 40 \u00B0C in the case of dsDNA viruses. Compared to arboviruses which also infect warm-blooded vertebrates, HIV is large at 134 nm diameter and thus would have a large negative \u0394Sa_immob which would diminish its binding at human body temperature. It is proposed that prior non-specific binding of HIV through attachment factors takes much of the entropy loss for \u0394Sa_immob so enhancing subsequent specific gp120:CD4 binding at 37 \u00B0C. This is consistent with the observation that HIV attachment factors are not essential but augment infection. Antiviral therapies should focus on increasing virion size, for example through binding of zinc oxide nanoparticles to herpes simplex virus, hence making \u0394Sa_immob more negative, and thus reducing binding affinity at 37 \u00B0C.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gale, Paul","journal":"Microb Risk Anal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf0a09d3c2554ec1d4765750011c6668ad394ab2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110232.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352352220300104; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352352220300104; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2020.100104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292808/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA/SA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cr binding","CD4 binding","arbovirus binding","diminished binding","HIV gp120 binding","peak binding","binding affinity","Abstract Virus binding","large negative \u0394Sa","Large negative values of \u0394Cp","prior non-specific binding of HIV","mol","kJ","intermediate values of \u0394Cp","binding of zinc oxide nanoparticles","increasing host temperature","bluetongue virus","host cells","HIV attachment factors","temperature sensitivity","higher temperatures","avian influenza virus","herpes simplex virus","Cr interactions","smaller viruses","low temperatures","larger diameter viruses","human body temperature","host cell surface receptors","Western equine encephalitis virus","specific interactions","enthalpy-driven GP","increasing virion size","subsequent specific gp120","observation","CD4 receptor","case of dsDNA viruses","arboviruses","bound arbovirus","little impact","nm diameter","entropy loss","virion volume decreases","enthalpy of association changes","small size phenotype","number of mosquito midgut cells","example","AIV","haemagglutinin","proteins","repulsive force","glyco","immobilisation","heat capacity","sialic acid","warmer hosts","warm-blooded vertebrates","Antiviral therapies","midge midguts","magnitude","transmission","infection","thermodynamic model","greater importance"],"language":"en"},

Live-attenuated cold-adapted HPIV3 vaccines have been evaluated in infants but a suitable interval for administration of a second dose of vaccine has not been defined. METHODS: HPIV3-seronegative children between the ages of 6 and 36 months were randomized 2:1 in a blinded study to receive two doses of 10(5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of live-attenuated, recombinant cold-passaged human PIV3 vaccine (rHPIV3cp45) or placebo 6 months apart. Serum antibody levels were assessed prior to and approximately 4-6 weeks after each dose. Vaccine virus infectivity, defined as detection of vaccine-HPIV3 in nasal wash and/or a \u2265 4-fold rise in serum antibody titer, and reactogenicity were assessed on days 3, 7, and 14 following immunization. RESULTS: Forty HPIV3-seronegative children (median age 13 months; range 6-35 months) were enrolled; 27 (68%) received vaccine and 13 (32%) received placebo. Infectivity was detected in 25 (96%) of 26 evaluable vaccinees following dose 1 and 9 of 26 subject (35%) following dose 2. Among those who shed virus, the median duration of viral shedding was 12 days (range, 6-15 days) after dose 1 and 6 days (range 3-8 days) after dose 2, with a mean peak log(10) viral titer of 3.4 PFU/mL (SD: 1.0) after dose 1 compared to1.5 PFU/mL (SD: 0.92) after dose 2. Overall, reactogenicity was mild, with no difference in rates of fever and upper respiratory infection symptoms between vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: rHPIV3cp45 was immunogenic and well-tolerated in seronegative young children. A second dose administered 6 months after the initial dose was restricted in those previously infected with vaccine virus; however, the second dose boosted antibody responses and induced antibody responses in two previously uninfected children.","publish_time":"2013-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Englund, Janet A.; Karron, Ruth A.; Cunningham, Coleen K; LaRussa, Philip; Melvin, Ann; Yogev, Ram; Handelsman, Ed; Siberry, George K; Thumar, Bhavanji; Schappell, Elizabeth; Bull, Catherine V.; Chu, Helen Y.; Schaap-Nutt, Anne; Buchholz, Ursula; Collins, Peter L.; Schmidt, Alexander C.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f33af692d3f91521c62c3da9600af432f955cc8c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/86c3e62c6f5a736ed1dd7e5097e829641b8a4580.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3889708.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13013005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X13013005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24103895/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.09.046; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3889708?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dose of vaccine","initial dose","months","days","HPIV3-seronegative children","Vaccine virus infectivity","detection of vaccine","tissue culture infectious dose","seronegative young children","human PIV3 vaccine","uninfected children","range","serum antibody titer","induced antibody responses","Serum antibody levels","cold-adapted HPIV3 vaccines","infants","viral titer","rHPIV3cp45","Human parainfluenza virus type","placebo groups","reactogenicity","PFU","SD","following immunization","upper respiratory infection symptoms","median age","median duration of viral shedding","common cause of upper","lower respiratory tract illness","rates of fever","difference","administration","mean peak log","BACKGROUND","fold rise","ages","suitable interval","nasal wash","doses","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS","blinded study","evaluable vaccinees","to1","subject","TCID","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. METHODS: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R(t)) in Wuhan declined from 2\u00B735 (95% CI 1\u00B715\u20134\u00B777) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1\u00B705 (0\u00B741\u20132\u00B739) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of R(t), assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

Today\u2019s telemedicine options relate not only to the area of diagnostics, but also to the monitoring of therapy courses and rehabilitation measures. Due to the current resource constraints, many orthopedic surgeons and trauma surgeons have been forced to set up video consultations, although standards for orthopedic video consultations have so far been insufficiently developed. In order to maximize the efficiency of virtual orthopedics, patients should be prepared for the virtual visit (checklist with specific instructions on camera positioning, body positioning, adjustment and clothing, testing of audiovisual skills). Classic diagnostic measures such as anamnesis, inspection and assessment of radiological findings are possible in the video consultation. One major disadvantage is, that there is no possibility for a functional examination (stability of the knee joint, shoulder tests). Although initial controlled scientific studies have shown that telemedical diagnostics are not inferior to conventional diagnostics, there are still no validated examination protocols and methods. Postoperative monitoring of rehabilitation measures can, for example, be made easier by the use of sensors. With modern sensors, inexpensive detection of joint mobility and joint position is now possible and is already used in the area of rehabilitation after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Here too, further research is certainly necessary to validate these methods. We believe that the current pandemic offers opportunities to further expand the possibilities of telemedicine for orthopedics and trauma surgery in order to continue to use it in the future (e.g. in the care of patients from abroad or in sparsely populated areas, care of professional athletes).","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Backhaus, Luisa; Bierke, Sebastian; Karpinski, Katrin; H\u00E4ner, Martin; Petersen, Wolf","journal":"Knie J.","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c2d89caa47e187d9e59f6b9dbb6e46c343e21bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7221338.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s43205-020-00062-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["telemedical diagnostics","area of rehabilitation","area of diagnostics","care of patients","orthopedic video consultations","telemedical care options","Postoperative monitoring of rehabilitation measures","knee joint","joint position","orthopedic surgeons","trauma surgeons","conventional diagnostics","current pandemic","order","use of sensors","methods","efficiency of virtual orthopedics","Classic diagnostic measures","care of professional athletes","Today\u2019s telemedicine options","body positioning","camera positioning","inexpensive detection of joint mobility","virtual visit","trauma surgery","functional examination","modern sensors","possibilities of telemedicine","monitoring of therapy courses","validated examination protocols","current resource constraints","specific instructions","adjustment","clothing","anamnesis","inspection","checklist","stability","assessment of radiological findings","reconstruction","standards","populated areas","initial controlled scientific studies","testing of audiovisual skills","anterior cruciate ligament","shoulder tests","possibility","opportunities","example","outbreak","COVID","major disadvantage","research","future"],"language":"en"},

New methodologies for studying the immune response of dogs during Leishmania infection and after receiving vaccines and treatments against CVL would be useful. In this context, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy dogs to evaluate procedures related to (i) establishment of in vitro conditions of monocytes differentiated into macrophages infected with L. chagasi and (ii) purification procedures of T-cell subsets (CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B) using microbeads. Our data demonstrated that after 5 days of differentiation, macrophages were able to induce significant phagocytic and microbicidal activity after L. chagasi infection and also showed increased frequency of parasitism and a higher parasite load. Although N-acetyl-\u03B2-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) levels presented similar levels of macrophage culture and L. chagasi infection, a progressive decrease in myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels was a hallmark over 5 days of culture. High purity levels (\u003E90%) of CD4 and CD8 T cells were obtained on a magnetic separation column. We concluded that monocytes differentiated into macrophages at 5 days and displayed an intermediate frequency of parasitism and parasite load 72h after L. chagasi infection. Furthermore, the purification system using canine T-lymphocyte subsets obtained after 5 days of monocyte differentiation proved efficient for CD4 or CD8 T-cell purification (\u226590%). The in vitro analysis using L. chagasi-infected macrophages and purified T cells presented a prospective methodology that could be incorporated in CVL vaccine and treatment studies that aim to analyze the microbicidal potential induced by specific CD4\u002B and/or CD8\u002B T cells.","publish_time":"2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viana, Kelvinson Fernandes; Aguiar-Soares, Rodrigo Dian Oliveira; Roatt, Bruno Mendes; Resende, Lucilene Aparecida; Silveira-Lemos, Denise da; Corr\u00EAa-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis; Moura, Sandra Lima; Zanini, Marcos Santos; Ara\u00FAjo, M\u00E1rcio Sobreira Silva; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa; Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f61db2492bf5bb245616f61730a6866d3c471e32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115789.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401713004779; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401713004779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24018185/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.08.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chagasi infection","CD8 T cells","Leishmania chagasi","chagasi-infected macrophages","CD8 T-cell purification","purified T cells","purification procedures of T","Leishmania infection","canine T-lymphocyte subsets","days of differentiation","days of culture","purification system","specific CD4","CVL vaccine","canine immune system","days of monocyte differentiation","cell subsets","immune response of dogs","similar levels of macrophage culture","higher parasite load","dogs present","healthy dogs","High purity levels","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","increased frequency of parasitism","intermediate frequency of parasitism","microbicidal activity","Abstract Canine visceral leishmaniasis","treatment strategies","microbicidal potential","treatment studies","conditions of monocytes","course of developing vaccines","important technique","glucosaminidase","PBMCs","NAG","major natural reservoir","\u03B2-d","progressive decrease","countries","myeloperoxidase","parasitic disease endemic","prospective methodology","treatments","hallmark","N-acetyl","context","New methodologies","establishment of","magnetic separation column","Biomarkers","analysis","infantum","data","microbeads"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We prospectively collected medical records of 14 health care workers (HCWs) who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, in neurosurgery department of Wuhan Union Hospital, China. RESULTS: Among the 14 HCWs, 12 were conformed cases, the other 2 were suspected cases. Most of them were either exposed to the two index patients or infected coworkers, without knowing they were COVID-19 patients. There were 4 male and 10 female infected HCWs in this cohort, whose mean age was 36 years (SD, 6 years). The main symptoms included myalgia or fatigue (100%), fever (86%) and dry cough (71%). On admission, 79% of infected HCWs showed leucopenia and 43% lymphopenia. Reduced complement C3 could be seen in 57% of the infected HCWs and IL-6 was significantly elevated in 86% of them. The proportion of lymphocytes subsets, concentrations of immunoglobulins, complement C4, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B3 were within normal range in these 14 infected HCWs. The most frequent findings on pulmonary computed tomographic images were bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacifications (86%). CONCLUSIONS: Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 pneumonia has occurred among HCWs, and most of these infected HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 are mild cases.

Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined. Results We compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results. Comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p = 0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups: all controls (N = 6120), non-influenza positive controls (N = 2880), and pan-negative controls (N = 3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much (range: 0.46\u20130.51). Conclusions Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results. Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses, but also parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolff, Greg G.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d03cf2f21e08b7e0df78531221da6c06915e1b50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126676.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607599/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.10.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19313647; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X19313647","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","influenza vaccination status","non-influenza respiratory viruses","respiratory virus status","non-influenza virus coinfections","influenza vaccine effectiveness","cases of influenza","virus interference phenomenon","non-influenza positive controls","Conclusions Receipt of influenza vaccination","Vaccine derived virus interference","specific respiratory viruses","individual respiratory viruses","non-flu viruses","respiratory illness","pan-negative results","test-negative vaccine effectiveness study","biasing vaccine effectiveness results","pan-negative controls","non-vaccinated patients","Test-negative study designs","mixed results","people","different control groups","positive direction","adjusted ORs","risk of infection","adjusted odds ratio","Department of Defense personnel","basic assumption","RSV","association","parainfluenza","human metapneumovirus","significant protection","comparisons","coronavirus","Abstract Purpose","confidence interval","population","range"],"language":"en"},

Microbiological and serological examinations confirmed the germ-free state of the germ-free rats and showed that no specific lung pathogens were present in the conventional rats. As in conventional rats, clinical symptoms and death of OSSMe-treated germ-free rats resulted from respiratory failure. The germ-free rats were not more resistant, but rather more susceptible to OSSMe than conventional rats. Increases in lung weight and histological examination of lung tissue 3 days after dosing with OSSMe (75 mg/kg, s.c.) showed no differences between germ-free and conventional rats. Despite alterations in their nasopharyngeal flora, death in the conventional rats was probably not caused by bacterial superinfection. The higher susceptibility of germ-free rats to OSSMe can be partly attributed to pharmacokinetic differences, since plasma levels of OSSMe decreased more slowly in germ-free than in conventional rats.

Previously, we showed that this disease is partially CD4 T cell-mediated since infection with a recombinant JHMV (rJ) mutated in only a single immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope (epitope M133, rJ.MY135Q) results in a nonlethal disease. Increased mortality correlated with a greater number of JHMV-specific CD4 T cells in the brains of rJ compared to rJ.MY135Q-infected mice. Here, we extend these results to show that the diminished number of virus-specific T cells correlates with a reduced cytokine/chemokine response in the infected brain. We also show that regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs) are critical for mild disease in rJ.MY135Q-infected mice because their depletion results in increased mortality. Further, a relative paucity of Tregs characterizes lethal infection because adoptive transfer of Tregs into rJ-infected mice increases survival from 0% to 50%. These results support the notion that clinical disease in coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis results from a balance between factors critical for virus clearance, such as virus-specific effector T cells and anti-inflammatory elements, such as Tregs. These findings also show that unlike chronic infections, in which an excessive number of Tregs contributes to pathogen persistence, Tregs in the setting of acute encephalitis may help to limit immunopathological disease without delaying virus clearance.","publish_time":"2009-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anghelina, Daniela; Zhao, Jingxian; Trandem, Kathryn; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59e45ad7bef66215b7f2b136cc5cac6aa5531178.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2684864.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208008155; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208008155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19141357/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.12.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tregs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rJ-infected mice","specific T cells","specific CD4 T cells","MY135Q-infected mice","virus-specific effector T cells","regulatory CD4 T cells","acute encephalitis results","brains of rJ","virus clearance","excessive number of Tregs","diminished number of virus","depletion results","clinical disease","immunopathological disease","mild disease","nonlethal disease","infected brain","single immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope","adoptive transfer of Tregs","relative paucity of Tregs","greater number of JHMV","mouse hepatitis virus","setting of acute encephalitis","fatal acute encephalitis","recombinant JHMV","Increased mortality","epitope M133","lethal infection","factors critical","balance","reduced cytokine","coronavirus","anti-inflammatory elements","pathogen persistence","chemokine response","strain JHM","notion","chronic infections","survival","Abstract C57BL","findings"],"language":"en"},

Human collagen type III (hCOL3A1) belongs to the fibril-forming collagens and is widely distributed in extensible connective tissue like skin, internal organs, or the vascular system. It plays key roles in wound healing, collagen fibrillogenesis, and normal cardiovascular development in human. The charged residues are considered to be an important characteristic of hCOL3A1, especially for collagen binding and recognition. Here we found that a triple helix fragment of hCOL3A1, Gly489-Gly510, contained multiple charged residues, as well as representative Glu-Lys-Gly and Glu-Arg-Gly charged triplets. We solved the crystal structure of this new fragment to a high-resolution of 1.50 \u00C5 and identified some important conformations of this new triple-helix region, including strong hydrogen bonds in interchain and interhelical interactions in addition to obvious flexible bending for the triple helix. We also found that the synthetic collagen peptides around this region exhibited potent activities through integrin-mediated peptide-membrane interaction. We then developed a method to produce a recombinant protein consisting of 16 tandem repeats of the triple-helix fragment of hCOL3A1 with strong activity without cytotoxicity. These results provide a strong base for further functional studies of human collagen type III and the method developed in this study can be applied to produce hCOL3A1-derived proteins or other tandem-repeat proteins with membrane adhesion activity.","publish_time":"2019-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hua, Chen; Zhu, Yun; Xu, Wei; Ye, Sheng; Zhang, Rongguang; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecb1e5b824a91a3b63e25cab93fe011630e83fe6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092849.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X18326639; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X18326639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545625/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["triple helix fragment of hCOL3A1","triple-helix fragment of hCOL3A1","collagen fibrillogenesis","collagen binding","Abstract Collagen","new triple-helix region","hCOL3A1-derived proteins","important characteristic of hCOL3A1","important proteins","functional studies of human collagen type","synthetic collagen peptides","new fragment","strong activity","human body","strong base","important conformations","method","multiple charged residues","strong hydrogen bonds","membrane adhesion activity","tandem repeats","Glu-Arg","representative Glu-Lys","integrin-mediated peptide-membrane interaction","interhelical interactions","internal organs","obvious flexible bending","potent activities","Gly489-Gly510","addition","interchain","wound healing","normal cardiovascular development","extensible connective tissue","skin","key roles","recombinant protein","vascular system","triplets","crystal structure","cytotoxicity","collagens","results","recognition","study"],"language":"en"},

Seeking a noninvasive method to conduct surveillance for respiratory pathogens, we sought to examine the usefulness of 2 types of off-the-shelf aerosol samplers to detect respiratory viruses in Singapore. METHODS. In this pilot study, we ran the aerosol samplers several times each week with patients present in the patient waiting areas at 3 primary health clinics during the months of April and May 2016. We used a SKC BioSampler with a BioLite Air Sampling Pump (run for 60 min at 8 L/min) and SKC AirChek TOUCH personal air samplers with polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon filter cassettes (run for 180 min at 5 L/min). The aerosol specimens and controls were studied with molecular assays for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses. RESULTS. Overall, 16 (33.3%) of the 48 specimens indicated evidence of at least 1 respiratory pathogen, with 1 (2%) positive for influenza A virus, 3 (6%) positive for influenza B virus, and 12 (25%) positive for adenovirus. CONCLUSIONS. Although we were not able to correlate molecular detection with individual patient illness, patients with common acute respiratory illnesses were present during the samplings. Combined with molecular assays, it would suggest that aerosol sampling has potential as a noninvasive method for novel respiratory virus detection in clinical settings.","publish_time":"2016-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Tham T.; Poh, Mee K.; Low, Jenny; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Thoon, Koh C.; Ng, Wai C.; Anderson, Benjamin D.; Gray, Gregory C.","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7aaf2c3f905813cd23b5ac719d49e662063edb9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5413998.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28480252/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofw259","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BioLite Air Sampling Pump"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza B virus","novel respiratory virus detection","respiratory viruses","respiratory pathogens","aerosol sampling","aerosol specimens","positive","molecular detection","molecular assays","types of off-the-shelf aerosol samplers","patients","common acute respiratory illnesses","noninvasive method","SKC AirChek TOUCH personal air samplers","BioLite Air Sampling Pump","SKC BioSampler","individual patient illness","polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon filter cassettes","areas","potential","clinical settings","week","adenoviruses","primary health clinics","surveillance","times","controls","months","usefulness","evidence","samplings","coronaviruses","Singapore","pilot study","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Initially, IFN\u03BB was demonstrated to induce expression of interferon-stimulated genes and exert antiviral properties in a similar manner to type I IFNs. However, while IFN\u03BB has been described to have largely overlapping expression and function with type I IFNs, it has become increasingly clear that type III IFNs also have distinct functions from type I IFNs. In contrast to type I IFNs, whose receptor is ubiquitously expressed, type III IFNs signal and function largely at barrier epithelial surfaces, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as the blood\u2013brain barrier. In further support of unique functions for type III IFNs, single nucleotide polymorphisms in IFNL genes in humans are strongly associated with outcomes to viral infection. These biological linkages have also been more directly supported by studies in mice highlighting roles of IFN\u03BB in promoting antiviral immune responses. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of type III IFNs, and how their functions are similar to, and different from, type I IFN in various immune cell subtypes and viral infections.","publish_time":"2017-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hemann, Emily A.; Gale, Michael; Savan, Ram","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c93e251c48b43dfc3e162039968b8ce59810c410.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5723907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270173/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01707","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","IFNL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFNs signal","current understanding of type","distinct functions","expression of interferon","roles of IFN\u03BB","antiviral immune responses","support of unique functions","IFNL genes","stimulated genes","antiviral properties","IFN family","viral infections","interferon lambdas","similar manner","brain barrier","barrier epithelial surfaces","various immune cell subtypes","single nucleotide polymorphisms","humans","recent addition","blood","outcomes","IFN\u03BBs","studies","mice","interferons","gastrointestinal tracts","review","discovery","receptor","biological linkages","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Methods Nasal-pharyngeal swabs from 233 preschool aged children were prospectively collected over four consecutive time periods, during one school year. The samples were tested using a RT-PCR DNA/RNA microarray system for nine respiratory viruses. Results Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was a predictor of the presence of influenza virus (INFL) (OR: 9.12, CI: 1.52\u201354.75, p =0.016), and similarly, INFL predicted the presence of RSV (OR: 4.01, CI: 1.14\u201314.16, p =0.030). Also, rhinovirus (RV) was a predictor of adenovirus (ADV) presence (OR: 3.66, CI: 1.10\u201312.14, p =0.034), and similarly, ADV predicted the presence of RV (OR: 4.05, CI: 1.02\u201316.05, p =0.046).

This study characterizes antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds of traditional Chinese medicinal plants associated with anticancer, comprising 112 species from 50 plant families. The improved ABTS\u2022\u002B method was used to systematically assess the total antioxidant capacity (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, TEAC) of the medicinal extracts. The TEAC values and total phenolic content for methanolic extracts of herbs ranged from 46.7 to 17,323 \u03BCmol Trolox equivalent/100 g dry weight (DW), and from 0.22 to 50.3 g of gallic acid equivalent/100 g DW, respectively. A positive, significant linear relationship between antioxidant activity and total phenolic content (all R 2 values\u22650.95) showed that phenolic compounds were the dominant antioxidant components in the tested medicinal herbs. Major types of phenolic compounds from most of the tested herbs were preliminarily identified and analyzed, and mainly included phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, lignans, quinones, stilbenes, and curcuminoids. These medicinal herbs exhibited far stronger antioxidant activity and contained significantly higher levels of phenolics than common vegetables and fruits.

Early diagnosis is crucial for disease treatment and control as it reduces inappropriate use of antiviral therapy and focuses surveillance activity. This requires the ability to detect and accurately diagnose infection at or close to the source/outbreak with minimum delay and the need for specific, accessible point-of-care diagnosis able to distinguish causative viruses and their subtypes. None of the available viral diagnostic assays combine a point-of-care format with the complex capability to identify a large range of human and animal viruses. Microarray detection provides a useful, labor-saving tool for detection of multiple viruses with several advantages, such as convenience and prevention of cross-contamination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, which is of foremost importance in such applications. Recently, real-time PCR assays with the ability to confirm the amplification product and quantitate the target concentration have been developed. Furthermore, nucleotide sequence analysis of amplification products has facilitated epidemiological studies of infectious disease outbreaks and monitoring of treatment outcomes for infections, in particular for viruses that mutate at high frequency. This review discusses applications of microarray technology as a potential new tool for detection and identification of acute encephalitis-causing viruses in human serum, plasma, and cell cultures.","publish_time":"2012-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Desh Deepak; Jain, Amita","journal":"Curr Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a86517ad056a8b3d53a4ecc467fe26e993d7bf51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080014.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00284-012-0154-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22674173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Detection of multiple viruses","causative viruses","animal viruses","Microarray detection","disease treatment","care diagnosis able","pathogenic diagnosis","Early diagnosis","potential new tool","applications of microarray technology","real-time PCR assays","nucleotide sequence analysis of amplification products","labor-saving tool","accessible point","new prospects","human serum","care format","monitoring of treatment outcomes","global analysis of gene","large range of human","available viral diagnostic assays","epidemiological studies of infectious disease outbreaks","contamination of polymerase chain reaction","identification of acute encephalitis","need","terms of molecular","prevention of cross","physiological systems","protein content","source","minimum delay","inappropriate use of antiviral therapy","expression","complex capability","control","plasma","infections","advantages","convenience","surveillance activity","cell cultures","target concentration","foremost importance","review","high frequency","subtypes"],"language":"en"},

In this study, in vivo efficacy of verdinexor was further evaluated in two animal models or influenza virus infection, mice and ferrets. In mice, verdinexor was efficacious to limit virus shedding, reduce pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and moderate leukocyte infiltration into the bronchoalveolar space. Similarly, verdinexor-treated ferrets had reduced lung pathology, virus burden, and inflammatory cytokine expression in the nasal wash exudate. These findings support the anti-viral efficacy of verdinexor, and warrant its development as a novel antiviral therapeutic for influenza infection.","publish_time":"2016-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perwitasari, Olivia; Johnson, Scott; Yan, Xiuzhen; Register, Emery; Crabtree, Jackelyn; Gabbard, Jon; Howerth, Elizabeth; Shacham, Sharon; Carlson, Robert; Tamir, Sharon; Tripp, Ralph A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fddc1d4d4d31015df5e948d0119947b8bd681d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5125695.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27893810/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0167221","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus infection","virus shedding","pulmonary virus burden","influenza infection","mice","verdinexor-treated ferrets","influenza replication","anti-viral efficacy of verdinexor","IAV","antiviral activity","Antiviral drugs","pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokine expression","drug resistance","severe illness","novel nuclear export inhibitor drug","new therapeutic approaches","seasonal epidemics of respiratory illness","moderate leukocyte infiltration","lung pathology","animal models","nasal wash exudate","important countermeasure","bronchoalveolar space","development","findings","death","study"],"language":"en"},

This chapter deals with the innate immune response, a mechanism that operates immediately to limit tissue injury and prevent the spread of virus to adjacent, healthy cells, the so-called \u201Cbystander\u201D effect. Innate immunity is of broad specificity, modulated largely by the secretion of an extensive array of signaling molecules that collectively form local inflammatory responses. Almost all viruses have developed elaborate strategies to circumvent host innate immunity. Some viruses use the host innate response as a vital part of the replication cycle, for example by taking advantage of innate responses the number of cell surface viral receptors may increase or use of an expanded endoplasmic reticulum for virus assembly.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burrell, Christopher J.; Howard, Colin R.; Murphy, Frederick A.","journal":"Fenner and White\u0027s Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62d341a73cffc87417a14c195ef1fb144750b6d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173408.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123751560000059; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123751560000059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host innate immunity","innate immune response","host innate response","advantage of innate responses","spread of virus","virus assembly","adaptive immunity","viruses","local inflammatory responses","major forms of immune defense","number of cell surface viral receptors","healthy cells","molecules","example","elaborate strategies","bystander","entry","expanded endoplasmic reticulum","mechanism","replication cycle","natural barrier","broad specificity","secretion","extensive array","tissue injury","chapter","effect"],"language":"en"},

The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus causes isolated cases and outbreaks of severe respiratory disease. Essential features of the natural history of disease are poorly understood. Methods. We studied 37 adult patients infected with MERS coronavirus for viral load in the lower and upper respiratory tracts (LRT and URT, respectively), blood, stool, and urine. Antibodies and serum neutralizing activities were determined over the course of disease. Results. One hundred ninety-nine LRT samples collected during the 3 weeks following diagnosis yielded virus RNA in 93% of tests. Average (maximum) viral loads were 5 \u00D7 10(6) (6 \u00D7 10(10)) copies/mL. Viral loads (positive detection frequencies) in 84 URT samples were 1.9 \u00D7 10(4) copies/mL (47.6%). Thirty-three percent of all 108 serum samples tested yielded viral RNA. Only 14.6% of stool and 2.4% of urine samples yielded viral RNA. All seroconversions occurred during the first 2 weeks after diagnosis, which corresponds to the second and third week after symptom onset. Immunoglobulin M detection provided no advantage in sensitivity over immunoglobulin G (IgG) detection. All surviving patients, but only slightly more than half of all fatal cases, produced IgG and neutralizing antibodies. The levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies were weakly and inversely correlated with LRT viral loads. Presence of antibodies did not lead to the elimination of virus from LRT. Conclusions. The timing and intensity of respiratory viral shedding in patients with MERS closely matches that of those with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Blood viral RNA does not seem to be infectious. Extrapulmonary loci of virus replication seem possible. Neutralizing antibodies do not suffice to clear the infection.","publish_time":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corman, Victor M.; Albarrak, Ali M.; Omrani, Ali Senosi; Albarrak, Mohammed M.; Farah, Mohamed Elamin; Almasri, Malak; Muth, Doreen; Sieberg, Andrea; Meyer, Benjamin; Assiri, Abdullah M.; Binger, Tabea; Steinhagen, Katja; Lattwein, Erik; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Drosten, Christian; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5de523fd2c5ec10034fafb33fd192fcde1a28973.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26565003/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ951","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["LRT viral loads","yielded viral RNA","Blood viral RNA","neutralizing antibodies","LRT samples","intensity of respiratory viral shedding","virus RNA","URT samples","serum samples","urine samples","Presence of antibodies","outbreaks of severe respiratory disease","MERS coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","upper respiratory tracts","Middle East respiratory syndrome","levels of IgG","weeks","elimination of virus","adult patients","surviving patients","course of disease","stool","diagnosis","copies","positive detection frequencies","natural history of disease","isolated cases","fatal cases","immunoglobulin G","Extrapulmonary loci of virus replication","advantage","sensitivity","timing","Essential features","activities","Average","maximum","symptom onset","half","percent","tests","seroconversions","infection","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Other coronaviruses, such as Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Avian coronavirus, are important livestock pathogens. Ribosome profiling is a technique which exploits the capacity of the translating ribosome to protect around 30 nucleotides of mRNA from ribonuclease digestion. Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments are purified, subjected to deep sequencing and mapped back to the transcriptome to give a global \u201Csnap-shot\u201D of translation. Parallel RNA sequencing allows normalization by transcript abundance. Here we apply ribosome profiling to cells infected with Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), a model coronavirus in the same genus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The data obtained allowed us to study the kinetics of virus transcription and translation with exquisite precision. We studied the timecourse of positive and negative-sense genomic and subgenomic viral RNA production and the relative translation efficiencies of the different virus ORFs. Virus mRNAs were not found to be translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation at later time points due to high levels of virus transcripts. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of translated reading frames and revealed several translated short open reading frames upstream of, or embedded within, known virus protein-coding regions. Ribosome pause sites were identified in the virus replicase polyprotein pp1a ORF and investigated experimentally. Contrary to expectations, ribosomes were not found to pause at the ribosomal frameshift site.

While a substantial effort has been made to quantify progress towards SDG3, less research has focused on tracking spending towards this goal. We used spending estimates to measure progress in financing the priority areas of SDG3, examine the association between outcomes and financing, and identify where resource gains are most needed to achieve the SDG3 indicators for which data are available. METHODS: We estimated domestic health spending, disaggregated by source (government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private) from 1995 to 2017 for 195 countries and territories. For disease-specific health spending, we estimated spending for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis for 135 low-income and middle-income countries, and malaria in 106 malaria-endemic countries, from 2000 to 2017. We also estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2019, by source, disbursing development agency, recipient, and health focus area, including DAH for pandemic preparedness. Finally, we estimated future health spending for 195 countries and territories from 2018 until 2030. We report all spending estimates in inflation-adjusted 2019 US$, unless otherwise stated. FINDINGS: Since the development and implementation of the SDGs in 2015, global health spending has increased, reaching $7\u00B79 trillion (95% uncertainty interval 7\u00B78\u20138\u00B70) in 2017 and is expected to increase to $11\u00B70 trillion (10\u00B77\u201311\u00B72) by 2030. In 2017, in low-income and middle-income countries spending on HIV/AIDS was $20\u00B72 billion (17\u00B70\u201325\u00B70) and on tuberculosis it was $10\u00B79 billion (10\u00B73\u201311\u00B78), and in malaria-endemic countries spending on malaria was $5\u00B71 billion (4\u00B79\u20135\u00B74). Development assistance for health was $40\u00B76 billion in 2019 and HIV/AIDS has been the health focus area to receive the highest contribution since 2004. In 2019, $374 million of DAH was provided for pandemic preparedness, less than 1% of DAH. Although spending has increased across HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria since 2015, spending has not increased in all countries, and outcomes in terms of prevalence, incidence, and per-capita spending have been mixed. The proportion of health spending from pooled sources is expected to increase from 81\u00B76% (81\u00B76\u201381\u00B77) in 2015 to 83\u00B71% (82\u00B78\u201383\u00B73) in 2030. INTERPRETATION: Health spending on SDG3 priority areas has increased, but not in all countries, and progress towards meeting the SDG3 targets has been mixed and has varied by country and by target. The evidence on the scale-up of spending and improvements in health outcomes suggest a nuanced relationship, such that increases in spending do not always results in improvements in outcomes. Although countries will probably need more resources to achieve SDG3, other constraints in the broader health system such as inefficient allocation of resources across interventions and populations, weak governance systems, human resource shortages, and drug shortages, will also need to be addressed.

The discovery of neuro-mediators and cytokines and their receptors shared by the central nervous system and the immune system has prompted research work using reliable methodologies to study the relationship between a \u2018hard\u2019 scientific field, such as immunology, and a \u2018soft\u2019 one, such as the behavioral sciences. Current knowledge and key points The complexity of the studies on stress and immunity lies upon the choice of immunological measurements and the development of reproducible stress protocols. Models of stress in experimental animals may address acute versus chronic stress, and individual versus social stress. In humans, typical situations such as academic exams, and care given to patients with dementia, for instance, have been chosen to study large groups of subjects. The development of self-questionnaires for a reliable evaluation of stress and its consequences has led to more accurate measurements of psychosocial events. In animals, acute stress usually drives the immune response towards a Th2, grossly \u2018immunosuppressive,\u2019 profile. In humans, acute stress associates an endocrine response (characterized by glucocorticoid secretion and hyperprolectinemia) with an immunosuppression. Chronic stress is more likely to induce a range of effects, depending on the capacity of the subject to cope with stress, and on his/her social environment. Among the numerous mediators of the hypothalamo-pituitary cascade, Conicotropin Releasing Hormone is a key factor in the stress-immunity relationship. Several studies in humans have demonstrated the Influence of stress on the susceptibility to infections (including HIV infection) and on survival in malignant diseases. In autoimmune diseases, a high prevalence of depression, as well as a particular sensitivity to stressful events, seem to modify the course of conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rhumatoid arthritis or Sj\u00F6gren \u0027s disease. The relationship between stress and diseases is based on the pathogenic model which involves the following chain of events: Stressor, reaction to stress, neuro-endocrine changes, abnormalities of the immune response, and occurrence (or aggravation) of a disease. The evolution from health to disease could be associated, at least partially, with a \u2018passive\u2019 immunosuppressive mode of response, mediated by the pituitary-adrenal axis, typically the opposite of an \u2018active,\u2019 immunostimulant mode of response, mediated by adrenergic stimulation. Future prospects and projects Concept-related problems still remain to be solved: adaptation to stress (\u2018coping\u2019), is both genetically and socially mediated; the significance and interpretation of stress-related abnormalities and their precise involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases may be ambiguous. However, available epidemiological and pathophysiological evidence is currently sufficient to allow physicans in their everyday practice to take stress and depression into account in order to markedly improve the prognosis of many diseases related to immune responses. Prospective studies of neuropsychological intervention, using either pharmacologic or behavioral approaches, should be made to provide the necessary rational to a psychoimmunological management of patients.","publish_time":"1999-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vuitton, D.

The genes are best described in regional units. Among these, the best known is the polymorphic major histocompatibility complex-B (MHC-B) region containing genes for classical peptide antigen presentation. Nearby MHC-B is a small region containing two CD1 genes, which encode molecules known to bind lipid antigens and which will likely be found in chickens to present lipids to specialized T cells, as occurs with CD1 molecules in other species. Another region is the MHC-Y region, separated from MHC-B by an intervening region of tandem repeats. Like MHC-B, MHC-Y is polymorphic. It contains specialized class I and class II genes and c-type lectin-like genes. Yet another region, separated from MHC-Y by the single nucleolar organizing region (NOR) in the chicken genome, contains olfactory receptor genes and scavenger receptor genes, which are also thought to contribute to immunity. The structure, distribution, linkages and patterns of polymorphism in these regions, suggest GGA 16 evolves as a microchromosome devoted to immune defense. Many GGA 16 genes are polymorphic and polygenic. At the moment most disease associations are at the haplotype level. Roles of individual MHC genes in disease resistance are documented in only a very few instances. Provided suitable experimental stocks persist, the availability of increasingly detailed maps of GGA 16 genes combined with new means for detecting genetic variability will lead to investigations defining the contributions of individual loci and more applications for immunogenetics in breeding healthy poultry.","publish_time":"2016-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Marcia M.; Taylor, Robert L.","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae202093853b5ea243d4819646724fa18b64e0a3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1aeb1b6c5213c80ebd33f69021776928ee1fc315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4988538.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pev379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119321583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26740135/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119321583","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD1 genes","MHC-Y region","Roles of individual MHC genes","immune system genes","olfactory receptor genes","scavenger receptor genes","Nearby MHC-B","small region","single nucleolar organizing region","intervening region of tandem repeats","polymorphic major histocompatibility complex-B","detailed maps of GGA","CD1 molecules","immune responses","immune defense","specialized class","species","best known","immunity","disease associations","disease resistance","chicken genome","chicken chromosome","contributions of individual loci","applications","immunogenetics","availability","reason of sequence homology","patterns of polymorphism","investigations","T cells","new means","classical peptide antigen presentation","c-type lectin","distribution","linkages","present lipids","breeding healthy poultry","genetic variability","demonstrated role","suitable experimental stocks","structure","chickens","haplotype level","regions","microchromosome","lipid antigens","moment","regional units","instances"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (84.6%) correlated with clustering occurrence. The median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 (8\u201324 days) and 21.5 days (10\u201336 days), respectively. The median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was significantly different between patients with normal or atypical chest computed tomography (CT) findings (n=16, 61.5%; 7.5 days [2\u201320 days]) and patients with typical ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT(n=10, 38.5%; 12.5 days[8\u201322 days]; P\u003C0.01). Seven patients (70.0%) with initial positive nucleic acid test results had a negative result simultaneously with improved CT findings. Obvious improvement in CT findings was observed in three patients (30.0%) despite positive nucleic acid test results. CONCLUSION: In asymptomatic patients, changes in biochemical and inflammatory variables are small and changes on chest CT can occur. It is worth noting the long existence of SARS-CoV-2 in some asymptomatic patients and false-negative results need to be considered in SARS-CoV-2nucleic acid test.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Yanfeng; Yu, Xue; Du, Xinwei; Li, Qingqing; Li, Xianyang; Qin, Tao; Wang, Miaomiao; Jiang, Minlin; Li, Jie; Li, Weiguo; Zhang, Qian; Xu, Zhiwei; Zhang, Lu","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a76f177890f18ba150261f013bd910fe03656efd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32318703/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa205","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days","asymptomatic patients","positive results","initial positive nucleic acid test results","SARS-CoV","chest CT","improved CT findings","false-negative results","changes","diagnosis","long existence of SARS","median period","asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","atypical chest computed tomography","patchy opacities","inflammatory variables","typical ground-glass","clinical characteristics","contact","METHODS","Obvious improvement","RNA testing","CONCLUSION","carriers","clustering occurrence","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Cheetahs have been used as a classic example in numerous conservation genetics textbooks as well as in many related scientific publications. However, earlier studies used methods with low resolution to quantify MHC diversity and/or small sample sizes. Furthermore, high disease susceptibility was reported only for captive cheetahs, whereas free-ranging cheetahs show no signs of infectious diseases and a good general health status. We examined whether the diversity at MHC class I and class II-DRB loci in 149 Namibian cheetahs was higher than previously reported using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, cloning, and sequencing. MHC genes were examined at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. We detected ten MHC class I and four class II-DRB alleles, of which nine MHC class I and all class II-DRB alleles were expressed. Phylogenetic analyses and individual genotypes suggested that the alleles belong to four MHC class I and three class II-DRB putative loci. Evidence of positive selection was detected in both MHC loci. Our study indicated that the low number of MHC class I alleles previously observed in cheetahs was due to a smaller sample size examined. On the other hand, the low number of MHC class II-DRB alleles previously observed in cheetahs was further confirmed. Compared with other mammalian species including felids, cheetahs showed low levels of MHC diversity, but this does not seem to influence the immunocompetence of free-ranging cheetahs in Namibia and contradicts the previous conclusion that the cheetah is a paradigm species of disease vulnerability.","publish_time":"2010-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castro-Prieto, Aines; Wachter, Bettina; Sommer, Simone","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9fcb1ec08cd4d14c34f73fb0a90830c3b8056b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187558.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msq330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21183613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":["Namibia"],"keyphrases":["low number of MHC class","MHC loci","MHC genes","low levels of MHC diversity","DRB alleles","captive cheetahs","Namibian cheetahs","DRB loci","low genetic diversity","low resolution","DRB putative loci","paradigm of disease vulnerability","paradigm species of disease vulnerability","high disease susceptibility","immune genes","mammalian species","transcriptomic levels","immunocompetence of free","small sample sizes","smaller sample size","signs of infectious diseases","classic example","single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis","numerous conservation genetics textbooks","cloning","good general health status","major histocompatibility complex","methods","felids","individual genotypes","earlier studies","previous conclusion","Acinonyx jubatus","Phylogenetic analyses","sequencing","decades","Evidence of positive selection","hand","related scientific publications","study"],"language":"en"},

The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. METHODS: In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done. FINDINGS: The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5\u00B72 and 7\u00B74 log(10) copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020. INTERPRETATION: We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

We aimed to assess the impact of introducing highly sensitive fluorescent microscopy for examining sputum smear to replace conventional microscopy under a high TB risk setting. METHODS: We measured the impact of switch to fluorescent microscopy on the smear detection rate of culture-confirmed pulmonary TB, timing of respiratory isolation, and total non-isolated infectious person-days in hospital at a high-caseload medical center (approximately 400 TB cases annually) in Taipei. Multivariable Cox regression was applied to adjust for effects of covariates. The effect attributable to the improved smear detection rate was determined using causal mediation analysis. RESULTS: After switch to fluorescence microscopy, median non-isolated infectious duration decreased from 12.5 days to 3 days (P\u003C0.001). Compared with conventional microscopy, fluorescence microscopy increased sputum smear detection rate by two-fold (for all patients: from 22.8% to 48.1%, P\u003C0.001; for patients with cavitary lung lesion: from 43% to 82%, P = 0.029) and was associated with a 2-fold higher likelihood of prompt respiratory isolation (odds ratio mediated by the increase in sputum smear detection rate: 1.8, 95% CI 1.3\u20132.5). Total non-isolated infectious patient-days in hospital decreased by 69% (from 4,778 patient-days per year to 1,502 patient-days per year). CONCLUSIONS: In a high TB caseload setting, highly sensitive rapid diagnostic tools could substantially improve timing of respiratory isolation and reduce the risk of nosocomial TB transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Hsin-Yun; Wang, Jann-Yuan; Chen, Yee-Chun; Hsueh, Po-Ren; Chen, Yi-Hsuan; Chuang, Yu-Chung; Fang, Chi-Tai; Chang, Shan-Chwen; Wang, Jung-Der","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cac851f6bb322314ff1ddadd68dee97984daefca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122812.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32243434/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multivariable Cox"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conventional microscopy","pulmonary TB","TB control","TB cases","fluorescence microscopy increased sputum smear detection rate","smear detection rate of culture","improved smear detection rate","high TB caseload setting","high TB risk setting","sensitive fluorescent microscopy","Total non-isolated infectious patient-days","total non-isolated infectious person-days","patients","risk of nosocomial TB transmission","timing of respiratory isolation","median non-isolated infectious duration","impact of switch","year","fold","higher likelihood of prompt respiratory isolation","high-caseload medical center","sensitive rapid diagnostic tools","odds ratio","challenge","comorbidities","effect attributable","Undiagnosed tuberculosis","causal mediation analysis","cavitary lung lesion","BACKGROUND","hospitals","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","CI","Multivariable Cox regression","Taipei","effects of covariates","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We report a study to evaluate incidence and outcomes, both short and long-term, of RVI in children receiving HSCT. Between January 2000 and December 2012, 844 patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at the Hospital for Sick Children: 491 were allogeneic and 353 were autologous. When screening for causes of death in the first year after HSCT in the 844 patients, we found that RVI as a cause of death was only evident in the first 100 days after HSCT. Fifty-four (6.5%) patients were found to have an RVI within the first 100 days after HSCT (allogeneic = 32, autologous = 22). Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were documented in 31 (57%) and 23 (43%) patients, respectively. Viruses were parainfluenza (35%), respiratory syncytial virus (28%), influenza (22%), adenovirus (7%), human metapneumovirus (4%), coronavirus (2%), and rhinovirus (2%). Three patients relapsed with their primary disease before day 100 and were excluded. The overall mortality for the remaining 51 patients was 10% (allogeneic = 4, autologous = 1). All 5 deaths were directly attributable to RVI and all 5 deaths occurred in patients with a lower respiratory tract infection. The remaining patients were followed for a median of 4.3 years (range, 1.4 to 11.8) and no chronic pulmonary complications were observed. A clear seasonal pattern for contracting RVI was evident with 65% of total RVI occurring between October and March (35 of 427 versus 19 of 417, P = .03). Given the significant mortality from RVI and the challenges in preventing them, choosing the time to start HSCT, whenever possible, may help prevent RVI and improve outcomes.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hutspardol, Sakara; Essa, Mohammed; Richardson, Susan; Schechter, Tal; Ali, Muhammad; Krueger, Joerg; Fujii, Hisaki; Egeler, R.

From April 2012 to March 2013, 507 children, aged up to 24 months and hospitalized with LRTI in one of the participating centers at Aracaj\u00FA, Salvador, Recife, and Macei\u00F3, had a sample of nasopharyngeal aspirate collected and analyzed for the following viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization on low-density microarrays: RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus. The result was positive in 66.5% of cases, RSV was the most common virus (40.2%). Except for rhinovirus (17%), all other virus had frequency rates lower than 6%. Viral coinfections were detected in 13.8% of samples. Possible related risk factors for RSV infection were low age upon entry, attendance of daycare, low gestational age, and low educational level of the father. The relative frequency of viral infections was associated with increasing temperature and decreasing humidity separately, but the results also suggested both associated with increased frequency of RSV.

Although the CCR2\u2013CCL2 axis plays an important role in trafficking CD11b(\u002B) Ly\u20106C(hi) monocytes to regulate immunopathological diseases, little is known about their role in monocyte trafficking during viral encephalitis caused by JEV infection. Here, we explored the role of CCR2 and its ligand CCL2 in JE caused by JEV infection using CCR2\u2010 and CCL2\u2010ablated murine models. Somewhat surprisingly, the ablation of CCR2 and CCL2 resulted in starkly contrasting susceptibility to JE. CCR2 ablation induced enhanced resistance to JE, whereas CCL2 ablation highly increased susceptibility to JE. This contrasting regulation of JE progression by CCR2 and CCL2 was coupled to central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of Ly\u20106C(hi) monocytes and Ly\u20106G(hi) granulocytes. There was also enhanced expression of CC and CXC chemokines in the CNS of CCL2\u2010ablated mice, which appeared to induce CNS infiltration of these cell populations. However, our data revealed that contrasting regulation of JE in CCR2\u2010 and CCL2\u2010ablated mice was unlikely to be mediated by innate natural killer and adaptive T\u2010cell responses. Furthermore, CCL2 produced by haematopoietic stem cell\u2010derived leucocytes played a dominant role in CNS accumulation of Ly\u20106C(hi) monocytes in infected bone marrow chimeric models, thereby exacerbating JE progression. Collectively, our data indicate that CCL2 plays an essential role in conferring protection against JE caused by JEV infection.

There were 3 deaths (1.4%), which were all due to the worsening of a respiratory infection. Conclusions: The patients undergoing the surgical procedures showed high rates of COVID-19 infection and postoperative complications, especially the patients with oncological diseases. Local resumption of surgical activity must be based on the prioritisation of the cases to be operated on, respecting certain premises of security and optimisation of the available resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martino, Marcello Di; Septiem, Javier Garc\u00EDa; Gonz\u00E1lez, Roc\u00EDo Maqueda; de Nova, Jose Luis Mu\u00F1oz; de la Hoz Rodr\u00EDguez, \u00C1ngela; Bonito, Alba Correa; Mart\u00EDn-P\u00E9rez, Elena","journal":"Cir Esp","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408995/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.04.029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection rate","rate of infection","severity of respiratory infection","severe respiratory infection","elective surgical activity","elective group","elective operations","oncological diseases","Brescia respiratory COVID","elective surgery group","surgical procedures","Retrospective study of patients","benign diseases","high rates of COVID","urgent surgery group","Local resumption of surgical activity","urgent procedures","pandemic","cases","overall postoperative complications","severity scale","progressive decrease","progressive increase","adopted therapeutic measures","BRCSS","optimisation","method","SARS-CoV","reduction","certain premises of security","spread","available resources","Material","peak","previous month","adaptation","Introduction","hospitals","prioritisation","total","Conclusions","worsening","Results","deaths"],"language":"en"},

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study aimed to assess the effectiveness of \u201Chigh-dose\u201D oral erythromycin as a prokinetic agent in decreasing the incidence of PNAC. Two secondary end points, including the time to achieve full enteral feeding and the duration of parenteral nutrition, were also evaluated. Methods: Infants consecutively admitted to the neonatal unit were randomized to receive erythromycin (12.5 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours for 14 days) or an equivalent volume of normal saline (placebo) if they attained less than half the total daily fluid intake (\u003C75 mL/kg/day) as milk feeds on day 14 of life. Results: Of 182 VLBW infants enrolled, 91 received erythromycin. The incidence of PNAC was significantly lower in erythromycin-treated infants (18/91) compared with placebo infants (37/91; P = .003). Treated infants achieved full enteral nutrition significantly earlier (mean, 10.1; SE, 1.7 days; P \u003C .001), and the duration of parenteral nutrition was also significantly decreased by 10 days (P \u003C .001). Importantly, fewer infants receiving erythromycin had 2 or more episodes of septicemia (n = 4) compared with placebo patients (n = 13, P = .03). No serious adverse effect was associated with erythromycin treatment. Conclusions: High-dose oral erythromycin can be considered as a rescue measure for VLBW infants who fail to establish adequate enteral nutrition and in whom anatomically obstructive pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract have been excluded.","publish_time":"2007-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Pak C.; Lee, Cheuk H.; Wong, Samuel P.S.; Lam, Hugh S.; Liu, Flora Y.B.; So, King W.; Lee, Cheuk Y.; Fok, Tai F.","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47d253f0bbb53f68a275e8249639e05212134782.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094421.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508507005677; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016508507005677","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background \u0026 Aims","PNAC","VLBW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["placebo infants","erythromycin-treated infants","VLBW infants","fewer infants","erythromycin treatment","High-dose oral erythromycin","duration of parenteral nutrition","adequate enteral nutrition","days","parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis","incidence of PNAC","enteral feeding","placebo patients","placebo-controlled study","gastrointestinal tract","functional gastrointestinal dysmotility","common problems","time","intolerance","low-birth","prokinetic agent","equivalent volume of normal saline","obstructive pathologies","milk feeds","effectiveness","weight","Conclusions","serious adverse effect","rescue measure","total daily fluid intake","secondary end points","life","mean","neonatal unit","episodes of septicemia","Results","Background","hours","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Viruses may evolve at high, uneven, and fluctuating rates among genome sites.

The relationship between biological lineages related by common descent is called \u2018phylogeny\u2019. For inferring phylogeny, the differences between aligned sequences of genomes and proteins are quantified and depicted in the form of a tree, in which contemporary species and their intermediate and common ancestors occupy, respectively, the terminal nodes, internal nodes, and the root. The tree is characterized by a topology, length of branches, shape, and the root position. A complex mathematical apparatus has been developed for phylogeny inference that can evaluate inter-species differences, facilitate tree building and comparison of trees, and assess the fit between data and tree through, typically, computationally intensive calculations. A reconstructed tree is an approximation of the true phylogeny that practically remains unknown. The phylogenetic analysis is used in applied and fundamental virus research, including epidemiology, diagnostics, forensic studies, phylogeography, evolutionary studies, and virus taxonomy.

Patients and Methods Retrospective, cohort study of 140 patients with moderate-to-critical COVID-19 associated pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation admitted from January 28th, 2020 to February 28th, 2020, and followed up through March, 13th 2020 in Union Hospital, Wuhan, China. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other measures were tested as predictors of in-hospital mortality in survival analysis. Results Of 140 patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, 51.4% were men, with a median age of 60 years. Patients with SpO2 \u226490% were older, more likely to be men, to have hypertension and to present with dyspnea than those with SpO2 \u003E90%. Overall, 36 (25.7%) patients died during hospitalization after a median 14-day follow-up. Higher post-oxygen supplementation SpO2 levels were associated with reduced mortality independently of age and sex (hazard ratio per 1-unit SpO2 0.93, 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.95, P \u003C .001).

Conclusions In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, hypoxemia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. These results may help guide clinical management of severe COVID-19 patients, particularly in settings requiring strategic allocation of limited critical care resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Jiang; Covassin, Naima; Fan, Zhengyang; Singh, Prachi; Gao, Wei; Li, Guangxi; Kara, Tomas; Somers, Virend K.","journal":"Mayo Clin Proc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f55a576b851f033f2ea5ac413d3b3d64369ffb1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619620303670; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.04.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376101/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620303670?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["patients","associated pneumonia","critical COVID","cohort of COVID","unit SpO2","hospital mortality","SpO2 cutoff","hospital death","Union Hospital","Higher post-oxygen supplementation SpO2 levels","hazard ratio","clinical management of severe COVID","reduced mortality","median age","confidence interval","Oxygen saturation","survival analysis","Results","dyspnea","cohort study","multivariable analysis","prediction of survival","strategic allocation of limited critical care resources","settings","sex","Coronavirus Disease","Methods Retrospective","markers","specificity","Wuhan","China","measures","predictors","hospitalization","day follow-up","sensitivity","Abstract Objective","hypertension","years","Conclusions","hypoxemia"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Trained qualitative researchers conducted a total of 48 hours of observation in 3 public tertiary care hospitals and 12 in-depth interviews with family caregivers. RESULTS: Family caregivers provided care 24 hours a day, including bedside nursing, cleaning care, and psychologic support. During observations, family members provided 2,065 episodes of care giving, 75% (1,544) of which involved close contact with patients. We observed family caregivers washing their hands with soap on only 4 occasions. The majority of respondents said diseases are transmitted through physical contact with surfaces and objects that have been contaminated with patient secretions and excretions, and avoiding contact with these contaminated objects would help prevent disease. CONCLUSION: Family caregivers are at risk for hospital-acquired infection from their repeated exposure to infectious agents combined with their inadequate hand hygiene and knowledge about disease transmission.

Recent work has suggested bats as zoonotic reservoirs of some human Bartonella infections; however, the ecological and spatiotemporal patterns of infection in bats remain largely unknown. Here we studied the genetic diversity, prevalence of infection across seasons and years, individual risk factors, and possible transmission routes of Bartonella in populations of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in Peru and Belize, for which high infection prevalence has previously been reported. Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA gene for a subset of PCR-positive blood samples revealed sequences that were related to Bartonella described from vampire bats from Mexico, other Neotropical bat species, and streblid bat flies. Sequences associated with vampire bats clustered significantly by country but commonly spanned Central and South America, implying limited spatial structure. Stable and nonzero Bartonella prevalence between years supported endemic transmission in all sites. The odds of Bartonella infection for individual bats was unrelated to the intensity of bat flies ectoparasitism, but nearly all infected bats were infested, which precluded conclusive assessment of support for vector-borne transmission. While metagenomic sequencing found no strong evidence of Bartonella DNA in pooled bat saliva and fecal samples, we detected PCR positivity in individual saliva and feces, suggesting the potential for bacterial transmission through both direct contact (i.e., biting) and environmental (i.e., fecal) exposures. Further investigating the relative contributions of direct contact, environmental, and vector-borne transmission for bat Bartonella is an important next step to predict infection dynamics within bats and the risks of human and livestock exposures.","publish_time":"2018-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Becker, Daniel J.; Bergner, Laura M.; Bentz, Alexandra B.; Orton, Richard J.; Altizer, Sonia; Streicker, Daniel G.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b83ccbaff4b9d9f4ac38fcfbbb2bdde5b3c53aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6159870.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30260954/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006786","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bartonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Peru","Mexico","South America"],"keyphrases":["bat Bartonella","individual bats","odds of Bartonella infection","infected bats","nonzero Bartonella prevalence","prevalence of infection","possible transmission routes of Bartonella","human Bartonella infections","populations of common vampire bats","infection dynamics","endemic transmission","high infection prevalence","bacterial transmission","strong evidence of Bartonella DNA","pooled bat saliva","streblid bat flies","individual saliva","Neotropical bat species","spatiotemporal patterns of infection","intensity of bat flies ectoparasitism","years","fecal samples","vector","sequences","individual risk factors","subset of PCR","PCR positivity","risks of human","relative contributions of direct contact","livestock exposures","positive blood samples","seasons","South America","Desmodus rotundus","zoonotic reservoirs","feces","Belize","Mexico","step","endocarditis","humans","gltA gene","Peru","country","potential","limited spatial structure","distributed bacteria","conclusive assessment of support","metagenomic sequencing","Recent work","genetic diversity","domestic animals","Phylogenetic analysis","biting","sites"],"language":"en"},

In respiratory infections it is often difficult to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections, and empirical treatment is common. Enhanced viral testing is expected to clarify clinical decision-making and reduce the prescription of antibacterial agents, but the impact of such information on patient care is unclear. Methods We conducted a (1:1) randomized controlled clinical trial involving 998 adults with respiratory symptoms, fever, chest pain or poor general condition in the emergency unit of a tertiary hospital. Multiplex PCR results for 496 patients were available in 24 hours (intervention group) and those for the remaining 502 patients were available in 7 days (control group). Our primary outcome measures were the duration of hospitalization and the consumption of antibiotics within 30 days of enrolment. Results In all, 841 of 998 (84%) patients had respiratory symptoms at study entry. A respiratory virus was detected in 175 (17.5%). The mean duration of hospitalization was 4.2 days (SD 5.4) in the intervention group and 4.1 days (SD 4.9) in the control group (difference 0.1, 95% CI \u20130.5 to 0.6, p 0.810).

The CMAH gene is thought to be present in most deuterostomes, but it has been inactivated in a number of lineages, including humans. The inability of humans to synthesize Neu5Gc has had several evolutionary and biomedical implications. Remarkably, Neu5Gc is a xenoantigen for humans, and consumption of Neu5Gc-containing foods, such as red meats, may promote inflammation, arthritis, and cancer. Likewise, xenotransplantation of organs producing Neu5Gc can result in inflammation and organ rejection. Therefore, knowing what animal species contain a functional CMAH gene, and are thus capable of endogenous Neu5Gc synthesis, has potentially far-reaching implications. In addition to humans, other lineages are known, or suspected, to have lost CMAH; however, to date reports of absent and pseudogenic CMAH genes are restricted to a handful of species. Here, we analyze all available genomic data for nondeuterostomes, and 322 deuterostome genomes, to ascertain the phylogenetic distribution of CMAH. Among nondeuterostomes, we found CMAH homologs in two green algae and a few prokaryotes. Within deuterostomes, putatively functional CMAH homologs are present in 184 of the studied genomes, and a total of 31 independent gene losses/pseudogenization events were inferred. Our work produces a list of animals inferred to be free from endogenous Neu5Gc based on the absence of CMAH homologs and are thus potential candidates for human consumption, xenotransplantation research, and model organisms for investigation of human diseases.","publish_time":"2017-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peri, Sateesh; Kulkarni, Asmita; Feyertag, Felix; Berninsone, Patricia M; Alvarez-Ponce, David","journal":"Genome Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4ff00b9e8eec242803472b134846a7dbec01989.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5767959.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evx251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206915/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMAH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lost CMAH","functional CMAH gene","functional CMAH homologs","consumption of Neu5Gc","absence of CMAH homologs","pseudogenic CMAH genes","phylogenetic distribution of CMAH","capable of endogenous Neu5Gc synthesis","inability of humans","sialic acid present","glycolylneuraminic acid","synthesis of N","human consumption","inflammation","nondeuterostomes","acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase","independent gene losses","xenotransplantation research","xenotransplantation of organs","deuterostome genomes","studied genomes","far-reaching implications","animal species","biomedical implications","handful of species","number of lineages","enzyme CMP-N","investigation of human diseases","model organisms","potential candidates","date reports of absent","cell surface proteins","total","pseudogenization events","foods","green algae","list of animals","red meats","available genomic data","arthritis","xenoantigen","organ rejection","work","prokaryotes","cancer","addition"],"language":"en"},

Mucosal lesions of neonates were similar to, but less extensive than, those of weanling calves. Loss of microvilli and goblet cells, with minimal epithelial erosions as early as day 1, progressed to necrosis of epithelium and adjacent lymphoid tissue, and leucocyte exudation. Lesions and clinical disease were progressive up to and including day 6 in neonates, but resolving in weanlings on days 5 and 8. By transmission electron microscopy, the physical characteristics of the phagocytic cells appeared similar in both age groups, and viral replication was not identified in leucocytes. Virus was isolated from, or found by immunocytochemistry in, the pharyngeal tonsil of all calves examined, except for two weanlings on days 1 and 8. Virus as detected by immunocytochemistry was restricted to epithelium and superficial lymphoid tissue in neonates, but was found in deep lymphoid tissue around germinal centres in weanlings. The study showed that the pharyngeal tonsil is readily infected with BHV-1 and may be an important lymphoid tissue for early anti-viral responses.

The impact of influenza on outpatient visits, hospital admissions, and deaths has not been fully demonstrated to date in south China. METHODS: A time series Poisson generalized additive model was used to quantitatively assess influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza disease burden by using influenza surveillance data in Zhuhai City from 2007 to 2009, combined with the outpatient, inpatient, and respiratory disease mortality data of the same period. RESULTS: The influenza activity in Zhuhai City demonstrated a typical subtropical seasonal pattern; however, each influenza virus subtype showed a specific transmission variation. The weekly ILI case number and virus isolation rate had a very close positive correlation (r = 0.774, P \u003C 0.0001). The impact of ILI and influenza on weekly outpatient visits was statistically significant (P \u003C 0.05). We determined that 10.7% of outpatient visits were associated with ILI and 1.88% were associated with influenza. ILI also had a significant influence on the hospitalization rates (P \u003C 0.05), but mainly in populations \u003C25 years of age. No statistically significant effect of influenza on hospital admissions was found (P \u003E 0.05). The impact of ILI on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was most significant (P \u003C 0.05), with 33.1% of COPD-related deaths being attributable to ILI. The impact of influenza on the mortality rate requires further evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: ILI is a feasible indicator of influenza activity. Both ILI and influenza have a large impact on outpatient visits. Although ILI affects the number of hospital admissions and deaths, we found no consistent influence of influenza, which requires further assessment.","publish_time":"2016-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Ru-ning; Zheng, Hui-zhen; Ou, Chun-quan; Huang, Li-qun; Zhou, Yong; Zhang, Xin; Liang, Can-kun; Lin, Jin-yan; Zhong, Hao-jie; Song, Tie; Luo, Hui-ming","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/882f40d2ce4eceeb438b59e25e2e023fb5e169ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4760679.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26894876/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149468","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":["Zhuhai City"],"keyphrases":["impact of influenza","impact of ILI","influenza disease burden","significant effect of influenza","influenza surveillance data","influenza virus subtype","consistent influence of influenza","feasible indicator of influenza activity","weekly ILI case number","weekly outpatient visits","significant influence","large impact","number of hospital admissions","respiratory disease mortality data","comprehensive disease surveillance system","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Zhuhai City","mortality rate","COPD-related deaths","virus isolation rate","subtropical countries","typical subtropical seasonal pattern","lack","close positive correlation","time series Poisson","understood owing","information-exchange mechanisms","inpatient","specific transmission variation","additive model","hospitalization rates","illness","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","period","RESULTS","populations","years of age","date","south China","evaluation","BACKGROUND","assessment"],"language":"en"},

There are no standard guidelines for the prevention and control of HPIV3 in the outpatient setting. After 2 HSCT inpatients diagnosed with HPIV3 were noted to have had multiple recent HSCT outpatient clinic (OPC) visits, an investigation of policy and procedures in the HSCT OPC was undertaken, and active surveillance for respiratory viral illness was instituted in the at-risk HSCT population. Between July 19 and August 30, 2005, 13 patients were diagnosed with HPIV3 infection. Morbidity in affected patients was significant, and mortality was high (38.5%) and not affected by antiviral therapy. Molecular typing identified several genetically distinct groups of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene of the 11 available isolates. Based on sequence relatedness among the isolates and the demographic and exposure history of the patients, in many of these cases HPIV3 infection likely was acquired in the HSCT OPC. The major infection control interventions were introduced between August 20 and August 24.

The large poxviruses also have an envelope but peplomers have so far not been identified. Virus infection in cell cultures and in animals is to a large extent dependent upon the capacity of a virus to adsorb to the target cells, that is, upon the presence of receptors. When a virus is adsorbed irreversibly to the plasma membrane, parts of the virus or the whole virus is taken into the cytoplasm to initiate virus-specific protein and mRNA synthesis. The intake of adenovirus particles into cells requires a long sequence of events before mRNA synthesis can be initiated in the nucleus of the infected cell.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Philipson, Lennart","journal":"Textbook of Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173450.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780407002531500128; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780407002531500128","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus infection","virus-specific protein","cell receptors","mRNA synthesis","penetration of viruses","cell cultures","Enveloped viruses","infected cell","target cells","large poxviruses","type projections","presence of receptors","plasma membrane","large extent dependent","animals","long sequence of events","togaviruses","number of glycoprotein","process of attachment","rhabdoviruses","addition","coronaviruses","intake of adenovirus particles","capacity","cytoplasm","Orthomyxoviruses","paramyxoviruses","arenaviruses","nucleus","parts","peplomers","chapter"],"language":"en"},

We have identified 6MP and 6TG as reversible and slow-binding inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro, which is the first report about small molecule reversible inhibitors of PLpro. The inhibition mechanism was investigated by kinetic measurements and computer docking. Both compounds are competitive, selective, and reversible inhibitors of the PLpro with K is values \u223C10 to 20\u03BCM. A structure\u2013function relationship study has identified the thiocarbonyl moiety of 6MP or 6TG as the active pharmacophore essential for these inhibitions, which has not been reported before. The inhibition is selective because these compounds do not exert significant inhibitory effects against other cysteine proteases, including SARS-CoV 3CLpro and several cathepsins. Thus, our results present the first potential chemical leads against SARS-CoV PLpro, which might be used as lead compounds for further optimization to enhance their potency against SARS-CoV. Both 6MP and 6TG are still used extensively in clinics, especially for children with acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemia. In light of the possible inhibition against subset of cysteine proteases, our study has emphasized the importance to study in depth these drug actions in vivo.","publish_time":"2008-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chou, Chi-Yuan; Chien, Chia-Hui; Han, Yu-San; Prebanda, Mojca Trstenjak; Hsieh, Hsing-Pang; Turk, Boris; Chang, Gu-Gang; Chen, Xin","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca5bca39d98242b83a33252236335a766f0bb4bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092826.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006295208000373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18313035/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2008.01.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295208000373","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV PLpro","TG","small molecule reversible inhibitors of PLpro","slow-binding inhibitors of SARS","possible inhibition","inhibition mechanism","lead compounds","subset of cysteine proteases","function relationship study","active pharmacophore essential","protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","potential chemical leads","children","kinetic measurements","significant inhibitory effects","thiocarbonyl moiety","report","viral life cycle","myeloblastic leukemia","depth","importance","optimization","drug actions","important antiviral target","computer docking","results","inhibitions","papain","structure","light","clinics","CLpro","potency","cathepsins","values","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

MERS-CoV has been a global threat due to continuous outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula and international spread by infected travelers since 2012. From May to July 2015, a large outbreak initiated by an infected traveler from the Arabian peninsula swept South Korea and resulted in 186 confirmed cases with 38 deaths (case fatality rate, 20.4%). Here, we show the rapid emergence and spread of a mutant MERS-CoV with reduced affinity to the human CD26 receptor during the South Korean outbreak. We isolated 13 new viral genomes from 14 infected patients treated at a hospital and found that 12 of these genomes possess a point mutation in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of viral spike (S) protein. Specifically, 11 of these genomes have an I529T mutation in RBD, and 1 has a D510G mutation. Strikingly, both mutations result in reduced affinity of RBD to human CD26 compared to wild-type RBD, as measured by surface plasmon resonance analysis and cellular binding assay. Additionally, pseudotyped virus bearing an I529T mutation in S protein showed reduced entry into host cells compared to virus with wild-type S protein. These unexpected findings suggest that MERS-CoV adaptation during human-to-human spread may be driven by host immunological pressure such as neutralizing antibodies, resulting in reduced affinity to host receptor, and thereby impairs viral fitness and virulence, rather than positive selection for a better affinity to CD26.","publish_time":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yuri; Cheon, Shinhye; Min, Chan-Ki; Sohn, Kyung Mok; Kang, Ying Jin; Cha, Young-Je; Kang, Ju-Il; Han, Seong Kyu; Ha, Na-Young; Kim, Gwanghun; Aigerim, Abdimadiyeva; Shin, Hyun Mu; Choi, Myung-Sik; Kim, Sanguk; Cho, Hyun-Soo; Kim, Yeon-Sook; Cho, Nam-Hyuk","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61ad64021b0e34d5e3a82a4310cc92d123a7061c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4810480.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26933050/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00019-16","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["reduced affinity of RBD","human spread","human CD26 receptor","mutant MERS-CoV","MERS-CoV adaptation","I529T mutation","wild-type RBD","reduced entry","wild-type S protein","better affinity","point mutation","D510G mutation","new viral genomes","Arabian peninsula","receptor-binding domain","infected patients","infected travelers","host cells","viral spike","viral fitness","international spread","host immunological pressure","South Korean outbreak","pseudotyped virus","large outbreak","severe respiratory infection","cellular binding assay","high mortality rate","case fatality rate","emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","surface plasmon resonance analysis","neutralizing antibodies","continuous outbreaks","confirmed cases","deaths","positive selection","global threat","virulence","unexpected findings","mutations","rapid emergence","hospital"],"language":"en"},

The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3\u20136). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days. Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community. Funding None.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pung, Rachael; Chiew, Calvin J; Young, Barnaby E; Chin, Sarah; Chen, Mark I-C; Clapham, Hannah E; Cook, Alex R; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Toh, Matthias P H S; Poh, Cuiqin; Low, Mabel; Lum, Joshua; Koh, Valerie T J; Mak, Tze M; Cui, Lin; Lin, Raymond V T P; Heng, Derrick; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lye, David C; Lee, Vernon J M; Kam, Kai-qian; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Tan, Seow Yen; Loh, Jiashen; Thoon, Koh Cheng; Vasoo, Shawn; Khong, Wei Xin; Suhaimi, Nur-Afidah; Chan, Sherlynn JH; Zhang, Emma; Oh, Olivia; Ty, Albert; Tow, Charlene; Chua, Yi Xian; Chaw, Wei Liang; Ng, Yixiang; Abdul-Rahman, Farid; Sahib, Shafiq; Zhao, Zheng; Tang, Cheryl; Low, Constance; Goh, Ee Hui; Lim, Georgina; Hou, Yan\u0027an; Roshan, Imran; Tan, James; Foo, Kelly; Nandar, Khine; Kurupatham, Lalitha; Chan, Pei Pei; Raj, Pream; Lin, Yijun; Said, Zubaidah; Lee, Anne; See, Cherie; Markose, Jessey; Tan, Joanna; Chan, Guanhao; See, Wanhan; Peh, Xinyi; Cai, Vincent; Chen, Wen Kai; Li, Zongbin; Soo, Roy; Chow, Angela LP; Wei, Wycliffe; Farwin, Aysha; Ang, Li Wei","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c12d71462529856463c2432d5628d10a0027c404.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32192580/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620305286; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30528-6; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673620305286","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore","China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["indirect transmission","transmission pairs","local clusters of COVID","Interpretation SARS-CoV","cases of COVID","days","clusters of circumscribed local transmission","median incubation period of SARS","confirmed COVID","possible modes of transmission","risk of widespread transmission","China","clusters of coronavirus disease","Singapore","IQR","prolonged close contact","affected individuals","contact tracing","community settings","overseas cases","close contacts","high travel volume","institution of travel restrictions","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","clinical data","lockdown of Wuhan","field investigations","interviews","interactions","countries","company conference","inpatient medical records","Enhanced surveillance","fomites","Summary Background","Open source reports","tour group","Methods","church","serial interval","shared food","Findings","Funding"],"language":"en"},

The disease presents as severe respiratory infection often with shock, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. Recently, we observed three cases who presented with neurologic symptoms. These are so far the first reported cases of neurologic injury associated with MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected from three patients admitted with MERS-CoV infection to Intensive Care unit (ICU) at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. They were managed separately in three different wards prior to their admission to ICU. FINDING: The three patients presented with severe neurologic syndrome which included altered level of consciousness ranging from confusion to coma, ataxia, and focal motor deficit. Brain MRI revealed striking changes characterized by widespread, bilateral hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging within the white matter and subcortical areas of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. None of the lesions showed gadolinium enhancement. INTERPRETATION: CNS involvement should be considered in patients with MERS-CoV and progressive neurological disease, and further elucidation of the pathophysiology of this virus is needed.

The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene of Breda virus serotype 2 (BRV-2) has been identified and the nucleotide sequence for BRV serotype 1 (BRV-1) genome which contains the open reading frames for the viral structural proteins has been reported revealing the presence of a 1.25 kb gene whose nucleotide sequence is identical to that of the BRV-2 HE gene. In this study, we amplified the 1.2kb HE gene from the HTV genome using long RT-PCR and sequenced the amplicon directly. At the nucleotide level, the HTV HE gene manifests 85% sequence identity to the HE genes of BRV-1 and BRV-2 and 89% identity with the X pseudogene sequence of BEV. The 1.25 kb amplicons which contained the HE genes of BRV-1 and HTV were cloned and expressed in a baculovirus system and the proteins purified by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hyperimmune sera prepared in guinea pigs against these proteins were reactive with both bovine torovirus (BTV) and human torovirus (HTV) antigens. By immunoblot, they reacted specifically with a 65 kDa protein corresponding in size to the torovirus HE protein. Furthermore, the hyperimmune sera but not the preimmune sera reacted with a series of BTV-positive and HTV-positive fecal specimens by immunoblot and dot blot analysis. By immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) torovirus particles from BTV-positive specimens from calves with diarrhea and HTV-positive specimens from patients were aggregated by the hyperimmune sera. Human convalescent sera and gnotobiotic calf post-infection sera reacted by immunoblot with the expressed 65 kDa protein. The expressed HE protein of HTV has important diagnostic potential.","publish_time":"1999-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duckmanton, Lynn; Tellier, Raymond; Richardson, Chris; Petric, Martin","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f084fa3b9768063bc36f08970e7c28a5e3f2f13b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125763.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817029900088X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817029900088X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRV","BEV","HTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein of HTV","HTV-positive specimens","HTV genome","BRV serotype","genes of BRV","Hyperimmune sera","HTV-positive fecal specimens","torovirus particles","genus torovirus","bovine torovirus","preimmune sera","nucleotide sequence","BTV-positive specimens","Abstract Human torovirus","Human convalescent sera","sequence identity","gene manifests","kDa protein","gene of Breda virus serotype","series of BTV","gnotobiotic calf post-infection sera","nucleotide level","X pseudogene sequence of BEV","viral structural proteins","sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","open reading frames","diarrhea","calves","family Coronaviridae","IEM","long RT-PCR","guinea pigs","members","patients","infectious agents of humans","dot blot analysis","immunoelectron microscopy","important diagnostic potential","size","cattle","antigens","baculovirus system","hemagglutinin-esterase","presence","amplicons","study"],"language":"en"},

Methods Seventy-one patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS were studied according to the modified World Health Organization case definition of SARS who were involved in the SARS epidemic between 10 March and 20 June 2003. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by serological test and/ or molecular analysis. Biochemical markers of bone metabolism were analysed retrospectively using serial clotted blood samples collected from each patient during the course of hospital admission to discharge and subsequent follow-up at out-patient clinic using the arbitrary time periods: (i) Day \u003C10; (ii) Day 28-44; (iii) Day 51-84; and (iv) Day \u003E90 after the onset of fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee and hip joints were performed post-admission to evaluate the prevalence of osteonecrosis amongst these SARS patients. Various risk factors for the development of osteonecrosis were assessed using receiver operating characteristics curve comparison with appropriate test statistics and Spearman\u2019s coefficients of rank correlation with biochemical bone markers. Results Biochemical markers of bone metabolism showed significant bone resorption as evidenced by a marked increase in serum C-terminal telopeptide concentration (CTx) from Day 28-44 after the onset of fever. With tapering down of corticosteroid dosage, CTx started to return to previous baseline level from Day 51 onwards, while other bone formation markers, serum osteocalcin and bone- specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations (OC and BALP, respectively), started to increase. The latter effect was even more marked after Day \u003E90. Seven patients developed radiological evidence of osteonecrosis. The prevalence of osteonecrosis in this cohort was 9.9%. A total corticosteroid dosage of \u003E1900mg hydrocortisone, \u003E2000 mg methylprednisolone, \u003E13 340 mg hydrocortisone-equivalent corticosteroid therapy, and \u003E18 days on corticosteroid therapy were found to be significant risk factors for the subsequent development of osteonecrosis. There were also significant positive correlations amongst various biochemical bone markers in this patient cohort. Conclusion Both bone resorption and formation markers were unable to predict the subsequent development of osteonecrosis. The use of high dose of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone for an extended duration was shown to be a significant risk factor for osteonecrosis. Its prevalence in this cohort is comparable to those reported in the literature for SARS patients with high-dose corticosteroid therapy. The Day 28\u201344 increase in the serum CTx coincided with the timing of corticosteroid use. The Day \u003E51 increase in serum OC and BALP coincided with the timing of corticosteroid withdrawal.","publish_time":"2006-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Michael H.M.; Chan, Paul K.S.; Griffith, James F.; Chan, Iris H.S.; Lit, Lydia C.W.; Wong, C.

Rapid detection and differentiation from seasonal influenza is essential to instigate appropriate patient and public health management and for disease surveillance. Objectives To develop a rapid and sensitive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) for confirmation of H1N1 swl. Study design A one-step rtRT-PCR approach was employed to target the matrix gene of the novel influenza A/H1N1 swl and validated against a panel of seasonal influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), swine influenza A/H1N1 and avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses. The assay following validation was then used prospectively to detect H1N1 swl positive specimens from the recent outbreaks in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Results The one-step H1N1 swl matrix rtRT-PCR successfully detected H1N1 swl clinical specimens and did not cross-react with seasonal influenza A, subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and swine influenza A (H1N1). The H1N1 swl matrix assay did cross react with H5N1. The H1N1 swl matrix assay was then compared to two other assays using a dilution series and a panel of untyped influenza A positive clinical samples. These experiments found the assay to have a comparable sensitivity to the established universal influenza A rtRT-PCR and was more sensitive than the H1N1 swl specific assay that targeted the H1 region. Conclusions The results demonstrate that the rtRT-PCR is sensitive and should be used alongside existing universal influenza A assays to rapidly detect the novel H1N1 swl virus.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carr, Michael J.; Gunson, Rory; Maclean, Alasdair; Coughlan, Suzie; Fitzgerald, Margaret; Scully, Mary; O\u2019Herlihy, Brian; Ryan, John; O\u2019Flanagan, Darina; Connell, Jeff; Carman, William F.; Hall, William W.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2ff483d3cf8f491141f9cc2e3a26dddacd41b5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173005.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.06.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209002479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540799/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209002479","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Republic of Ireland"],"keyphrases":["confirmation of H1N1 swl","H1N1 swl matrix assay","subtypes H1N1","H1N1 swl specific assay","novel H1N1 swl virus","H1N1 swl positive specimens","H1N1 swl clinical specimens","swine influenza","novel influenza","one-step H1N1 swl matrix rtRT-PCR","subtype H1N1 of swine","avian influenza","panel of seasonal influenza","panel of untyped influenza","established universal influenza","existing universal influenza","one-step rtRT-PCR approach","matrix gene","H3N2 viruses","H5N1 viruses","assays","results","positive clinical samples","Rapid detection","sensitive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","appropriate patient","public health management","recent outbreaks","differentiation","comparable sensitivity","lineage","dilution series","evidence of sustained transmission","world","UK","disease surveillance","Abstract Background","H1 region","countries","Study","Republic of Ireland","regions","Objectives","Conclusions","validation","experiments"],"language":"en"},

The aim of our work was to analyze V\u03B39V\u03B42 T-cell functionality during chronic HCV infection, studying the role of IFN-\u03B1 on their function capability. IFN-\u03B3 production by V\u03B39V\u03B42 T-cells was analyzed in vitro in 24 HCV-infected patients and 35 healthy donors (HD) after PhAg stimulation with or without IFN-\u03B1. The effect of in vivo PhAg/IFN-\u03B1 administration on plasma IFN-\u03B3 levels was analyzed in M. fascicularis monkeys. A quantitative analysis of IFN-\u03B3 mRNA level and stability in V\u03B39V\u03B42 T-cells was also evaluated. During chronic HCV infection, V\u03B39V\u03B42 T-cells showed an effector/activated phenotype and were significantly impaired in IFN-\u03B3 production. Interestingly, IFN-\u03B1 was able to improve their IFN-\u03B3 response to PhAg both in vitro in HD and HCV-infected patients, and in vivo in Macaca fascicularis primates. Finally, IFN-\u03B1 increased IFN-\u03B3-mRNA transcription and stability in PhAg-activated V\u03B39V\u03B42 T-cells. Altogether our results show a functional impairment of V\u03B39V\u03B42 T-cells during chronic HCV infection that can be partially restored by using IFN-\u03B1.

Attitudes toward suicide among medical staff members have been associated with appropriate therapeutic responses to suicidal individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of parental rearing on attitudes toward suicide among Japanese medical college students. METHODS: We examined the association between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide in 160 medical college students in Japan. The Parental Bonding Instrument was used to assess the attitudes and behaviors of parents. The attitudes toward suicide were evaluated using the Japanese version of the Attitudes Toward Suicide questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 25.2\u00B14.0 years old. The majority of the participants in our study agreed that anyone could commit suicide (88.8%) and that suicide is preventable (86.3%). After adjusting for age and sex, multivariate regression analysis revealed that maternal care approached a statistically significant association with the \u201Cright to suicide\u201D attitude. Under the same conditions, maternal care was shown to be significantly associated with the \u201Ccommon occurrence\u201D attitude. No other significant relationships were observed between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a higher level of maternal care ensures that children think that suicide occurs less commonly. The promotion of best practices for suicide prevention among medical students is needed. Child rearing support might be associated with suicide prevention.","publish_time":"2014-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hashimoto, Kojiro; Sugawara, Norio; Tanaka, Osamu; Nakamura, Kazuhiko; Yasui-Furukori, Norio","journal":"Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/497065a88412aca3ce4d3de9ebad13ce175e5f18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4211911.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25364256/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s70818","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Parental Bonding Instrument"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["suicide prevention","Attitudes","Suicide questionnaire","medical students","study","Japanese medical college students","Parental Bonding Instrument","effects of parental rearing","medical staff members","higher level of maternal care","significant association","Japanese version","suicidal individuals","mean age","significant relationships","years old","Child rearing support","multivariate regression analysis","grave public health issue","appropriate therapeutic responses","promotion of best practices","high mortality rate","sex","subjects","children","BACKGROUND","common occurrence","RESULTS","majority","participants","behaviors of parents","conditions","METHODS","aim","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This study examines the differences in student perceptions, knowledge and health behaviours between those schools that have adopted the HPS framework and those that have not adopted. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using multi-stage random sampling was conducted among schools with awards (HSA) and those schools not involved in the award scheme nor adopting the concept of HPS (non-HPS). For HSA group, 5 primary schools and 7 secondary schools entered the study with 510 students and 789 students sampled respectively. For the \u0027Non-HPS\u0027 group, 8 primary schools and 7 secondary schools entered the study with 676 students and 725 students sampled respectively. A self-administered questionnaire was used as the measuring instrument. RESULTS: Students in the HSA category were found to be better with statistical significance in personal hygiene practice, knowledge on health and hygiene, as well as access to health information. HSA schools were reported to have better school health policy, higher degrees of community participation, and better hygienic environment. CONCLUSION: Students in schools that had adopted the HPS framework had a more positive health behaviour profile than those in non-HPS schools. Although a causal relationship is yet to be established, the HPS appears to be a viable approach for addressing communicable diseases.","publish_time":"2008-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Albert; Wong, Martin CS; Keung, Vera MW; Yuen, Hilda SK; Cheng, Frances; Mok, Jennifer SY","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb4b8f43f68db5e493984b7e4e56d9f804d7e885.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2258284.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-8-42; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18234083/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Promoting School","HPS","HSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-HPS schools","HSA schools","primary schools","secondary schools","HPS framework","better health","students","concept of HPS","health behaviours","health information","better school health policy","Personal Health Skills","Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award scheme","student hygiene knowledge","HSA group","positive health behaviour profile","cross-sectional study","HSA category","personal hygiene practice","better hygienic environment","student perceptions","viable approach","communicable diseases","setting approach","growing epidemics of emerging infectious diseases","higher degrees of community participation","multi-stage random sampling","importance","statistical significance","key aspects","differences","awards","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","practices","access","self-administered questionnaire","measuring instrument","CONCLUSION","causal relationship"],"language":"en"},

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saber-Ayad, Maha; Saleh, Mohamed A; Abu-Gharbieh, Eman","journal":"Pharmaceuticals","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ph13050096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32423024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV","forefront of clinical care","coronavirus disease","clinical use","MERS-CoV","evolving human coronavirus infection","potential therapies","reviewed therapies","clinical management strategies","pharmacological treatment of COVID","randomized large-scale clinical trials","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","standard of care","health care professionals","patients","immune-modulating therapies","pandemic","Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics","World Health Organization","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","certain medications","additional drug development","computational analysis","virus structure","quicker screening of chemical libraries","molecular biology techniques","rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations","better recognition","advances","epidemiology","tool","established consensus","identification of compounds","virology","order","diseases","new agents","Wuhan","China","clear evidence"],"language":"en"},

However, almost nothing is known about how the public view these interventions or how they trade off risks (of disease) with inconvenience (of interventions). In this paper, we aim to understand public perceptions on pandemic interventions, as well as to identify if there are any distinct respondent preference classes. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment. SETTING: This study was fielded in Singapore between November 2012 and February 2013. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 500 Singapore residents aged 21 and over, including 271 women and 229 men, was analysed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic information was collected from each participant. Participants were also shown a series of pairs of alternatives, each combining interventions and morbidity, mortality and cost outcomes and declared a preference for one combination. A random utility model was developed to determine the individual\u2019s preference for interventions and a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify distinct respondent preference classes. RESULTS: On average, participants preferred more intense interventions, and preferred scenarios with fewer deaths and lower tax. The number of infections did not significantly influence respondents\u2019 responses. We identified two broad classes of respondents: those who were mortality averse and those who were expenditure averse. Education was found to be a predictor of group membership. CONCLUSION: Overall, there was considerable support for government interventions to prevent or mitigate outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, including those that greatly restricted individual liberties, as long as the restrictions showed a reasonable chance of reducing the adverse health effects of the outbreak.","publish_time":"2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cook, Alex R; Zhao, Xiahong; Chen, Mark I C; Finkelstein, Eric A","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85f0fe06df221d355fc228db1495a4f940e7c9b7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6a8fc2a90c03d2ade186c1a30777f5e56dc174a0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c9796b987137402c163bb03519d8cd9de9ae99f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5857709.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29453294/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["intense interventions","government interventions","pandemic interventions","public health interventions","PARTICIPANTS","distinct respondent preference classes","mortality averse","individual\u2019s preference","high mortality","public perceptions","public view","broad classes of respondents","morbidity potential","preferred scenarios","random sample","expenditure averse","Singapore residents","adverse health effects","random utility model","policy makers","fewer deaths","emergent epidemic","hierarchical cluster analysis","lower tax","reasonable chance","different stages","cost outcomes","Demographic information","alternatives","average","outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","considerable support","DESIGN","discrete choice experiment","OUTCOME MEASURES","restrictions","series of pairs","risks","inconvenience","restricted individual liberties","predictor of group membership","number of infections","respondents\u2019 responses","study","RESULTS","women","SETTING","Education","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE","paper","combination"],"language":"en"},

High-throughput next-generation sequencing has been used in characterizing the virome of different bat species. The cave nectar bat, Eonycteris spelaea, has a broad geographical range across Southeast Asia, India and southern China, however, little is known about their involvement in virus transmission. Here we investigate the diversity and abundance of viral communities from a colony of Eonycteris spelaea residing in Singapore. Our results detected 47 and 22 different virus families from bat fecal and urine samples, respectively. Among these, we identify a large number of virus families including Adenoviridae, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Polyomaviridae. In most cases, viral sequences from Eonycteris spelaea are genetically related to a group of bat viruses from other bat genera (e.g., Eidolon, Miniopterus, Rhinolophus and Rousettus). The results of this study improve our knowledge of the host range, spread and evolution of several important viral pathogens. More significantly, our findings provide a baseline to study the temporal patterns of virus shedding and how they correlate with bat phenological trends.","publish_time":"2019-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendenhall, Ian H; Wen, Dolyce Low Hong; Jayakumar, Jayanthi; Gunalan, Vithiagaran; Wang, Linfa; Mauer-Stroh, Sebastian; Su, Yvonne C.F.; Smith, Gavin J.D.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9464670c290cbe53aef50f1aca3011de96a1333c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6466414.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11030250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871070/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southeast Asia","India"],"keyphrases":["bat fecal","bat genera","different virus families","group of bat viruses","cave nectar bat","bat phenological trends","viral sequences","virome of different bat species","virus transmission","colony of Eonycteris spelaea","suppression of viral diseases","abundance of viral communities","large number of virus families","important viral pathogens","temporal patterns of virus","results","study","unique mammals","host range","unique immunological approaches","broad geographical range","distinctive life history traits","Southeast Asia","Adenoviridae","Papillomaviridae","India","Reoviridae","Flaviviridae","Parvoviridae","Paramyxoviridae","Eidolon","evolution","urine samples","Miniopterus","Picornaviridae","southern China","knowledge","cases","baseline","High-throughput","generation sequencing","Rhinolophus","Rousettus","Bats","diversity"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Syed Faraz; Quadeer, Ahmed A.; McKay, Matthew R.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a4d9e01bf11dea3e6a2bdae9109b508a6677a24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150947.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32106567/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12030254","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["available SARS-CoV","T cell epitopes","identified epitopes","immunogenic structural proteins of SARS","screened set of epitopes","set of B cell","existing immunological studies of SARS","derived B cell","novel coronavirus","novel virus","outbreak","new virus","broad coverage","population coverage analysis","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","associated MHC alleles","development of vaccines","spike","high genetic similarity","nucleocapsid","experimental efforts","insights","vaccine design","ways","findings","protection","sequences","imminent need","emergence of COVID","immune targeting","beginning","spread","study","mutation","China"],"language":"en"},

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective is to describe the clinicopathological phenotype of affected Holstein cattle homozygous for the causative apolipoprotein B gene (APOB) mutation. ANIMALS: Six Holstein cattle, 5 calves with a clinical history of chronic diarrhea, and 1 heifer with erosions in the buccal cavity and neurologic symptoms were admitted to the Clinic for Ruminants. METHODS: This case review included a full clinical examination, a complete blood count, blood chemistry, and measurements of cholesterol and triglycerides. The animals were euthanized and necropsied. A PCR\u2010based direct gene test was applied to determine the APOB genotype. RESULTS: All 6 animals were inbred, could be traced back to the sire Maughlin Storm, and were confirmed homozygous for the APOB mutation. The clinical phenotype included poor development, underweight, and intermittent diarrhea in the calves, and neurologic signs in the heifer included hypermetria and pacing. Hypocholesterolemia and low triglycerides concentrations were present in all animals. The pathological phenotype of all animals was steatorrhea with enterocytes of the small intestine containing intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles. The peripheral nervous system of the heifer displayed degenerative changes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Suspicion of CD in Holstein cattle is based on the presence of chronic diarrhea with no evidence of primary infections. Confirmation of the associated APOB gene mutation is needed. Additionally, the heifer demonstrated primarily signs of neurologic disease providing an unexpected phenotype of CD.","publish_time":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mock, T.; Mehinagic, K.; Menzi, F.; Studer, E.; Oevermann, A.; Stoffel, M.H.; Dr\u00F6gem\u00FCller, C.; Meylan, M.; Regenscheit, N.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/025ed2caa0ae1ab7f04d3479116e6ed2a334938d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5089636.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27279263/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.13976","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APOB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ANIMALS","clinical phenotype","clinical signs of diarrhea","heifer","APOB mutation","clinical examination","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","neurologic signs","clinical history of chronic diarrhea","associated APOB gene mutation","clinicopathological phenotype of affected Holstein cattle homozygous","unexpected phenotype of CD","intermittent diarrhea","APOB genotype","signs of neurologic disease","presence of chronic diarrhea","neurologic symptoms","Suspicion of CD","calves","hypocholesterolemia","direct gene test","blood chemistry","causative apolipoprotein B gene","measurements of cholesterol","Cholesterol deficiency","complete blood count","low triglycerides concentrations","small intestine","steatorrhea","autosomal recessive genetic defect","enterocytes","buccal cavity","erosions","intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles","poor development","peripheral nervous system","case review","evidence of primary infections","hypermetria","Confirmation","failure","degenerative changes","PCR","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","sire Maughlin Storm","HYPOTHESIS","OBJECTIVES","METHODS","pacing","Ruminants","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A genome-size RNA and seven subgenomic RNAs with molecular weights of approximately 3.3 \u00D7 106, 3.1 \u00D7 106, 2.6 \u00D7 106, 1.1 \u00D7 106, 1.0 \u00D7 106, 0.8 \u00D7 106 and 0.6 \u00D7 106 were detected. Comparisons of BCV intracellular RNAs with those of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) demonstrated the presence of an additional RNA for BCV, species 2a, of 3.1 \u00D7 106 daltons. BCV RNAs contain a nested-set structure similar to that of other coronaviruses. This nested-set structure would suggest that the new RNA has a capacity to encode a protein of approximately 430 amino acids. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs and genomic RNA are differentially regulated. At 4 to 8 h post-infection (p.i.), subgenomic RNAs are synthesized at a maximal rate and represent greater than 90% of the total viral RNA synthesized, whereas genome-size RNA accounts for only 7%. Later in infection, at 70 to 72 h p.i., genome-size RNA is much more abundant and accounts for 88% of total RNA synthesized. Immunoprecipitations of [35S]methionine-pulse-labeled viral proteins demonstrated that viral protein synthesis occurs early in the infection, concurrent with the peak of viral subgenomic RNA synthesis. Western blot analysis suggests that these proteins are stable since the proteins are present at high level as late as 70 to 72 h p.i. The kinetics of production of virus particles coincides with the synthesis of genomic RNA. These studies thus indicate that there is a differential temporal regulation of the synthesis of genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs, and that the synthesis of genomic RNA is the rate-limiting step regulating the production of virus particles.","publish_time":"1988-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keck, James G.; Hogue, Brenda G.; Brian, David A.; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44adc52e8c8f64f26adfd039081eb871c9797dea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170288900937; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170288900937","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","BCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synthesis of genomic RNA","total RNA","additional RNA","new RNA","total viral RNA","peak of viral subgenomic RNA synthesis","specific intracellular RNA","genome-size RNA accounts","synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs","subgenomic RNAs","viral protein synthesis","BCV RNAs","viral proteins","synthesis of bovine coronavirus","Comparisons of BCV intracellular RNAs","production of virus particles","h post-infection","structure similar","mouse hepatitis virus","kinetics of production","maximal rate","Kinetic studies","presence","step","methionine-pulse","MHV","differential temporal regulation","Western blot analysis","molecular weights","high level","capacity","species","Immunoprecipitations","amino acids","coronaviruses","daltons"],"language":"en"},

These vaccines have to meet requirements for safety, quality and efficacy. In addition to antigenic components, various adjuvants may be included in vaccines to evoke an effective immune response. To ensure the safety of new vaccines, preclinical toxicology studies are conducted prior to the initiation of, and concurrently with, clinical studies. There are five different types of preclinical toxicology study in the evaluation of vaccine safety: single and/or repeat dose, reproductive and developmental, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and safety pharmacology. If any adverse effects are observed in the course of these studies, they should be fully evaluated and a final safety decision made accordingly. Successful preclinical toxicology studies depend on multiple factors including: using the appropriate study designs, using the right animal model, and evoking an effective immune response. Additional in vivo and in vitro assays that establish the identity, purity, safety, and potency of the vaccine play a significant role in assessing critical characteristics of vaccine safety.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Green, Martin David; Hussain Al-Humadi, Nabil","journal":"A Comprehensive Guide to Toxicology in Preclinical Drug Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f7ff0afe6bc1aee46d74c3dcd7741a39f3d5d6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161391.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123878151000253; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123878151000253","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety of new vaccines","safety pharmacology","evaluation of vaccine safety","critical characteristics of vaccine safety","final safety decision","Successful preclinical toxicology studies","clinical studies","different types of preclinical toxicology study","effective immune response","appropriate study designs","mutagenicity","multiple factors","repeat dose","right animal model","various adjuvants","carcinogenicity","significant role","addition","antigenic components","purity","potency","requirements","assays","recombinant forms","course","identity","quality","efficacy","attenuated organisms","Immunity","infectious diseases","adverse effects","initiation"],"language":"en"},

Here, a strategy to facilitate manipulation and rescue of classical swine fever viruses (CSFVs) from full-length cDNAs present within bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) is described. This strategy allows manipulation of viral cDNA by targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis within bacteria. RESULTS: A new CSFV-BAC (pBeloR26) derived from the Riems vaccine strain has been constructed and subsequently modified in the E2 coding sequence, using the targeted recombination strategy to enable rescue of chimeric pestiviruses (vR26_E2gif and vR26_TAV) with potential as new marker vaccine candidates. Sequencing of the BACs revealed a high genetic stability during passages within bacteria. The complete genome sequences of rescued viruses, after extensive passages in mammalian cells showed that modifications in the E2 protein coding sequence were stably maintained. A single amino acid substitution (D3431G) in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase was observed in the rescued viruses vR26_E2gif and vR26, which was reversion to the parental Riems sequence. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis provides a powerful tool for expediting the construction of novel RNA genomes and should be applicable to the manipulation of other RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2013-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rasmussen, Thomas Bruun; Risager, Peter Christian; Fahn\u00F8e, Ulrik; Friis, Martin Barfred; Belsham, Graham J; H\u00F6per, Dirk; Reimann, Ilona; Beer, Martin","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef38ed2f4cc96e16ce011623cc5d15d2d8ca58c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3840674.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24262008/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-819","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genetic manipulation of RNA viruses","rescued viruses vR26","targeted recombination strategy","RNA dependent RNA polymerase","targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis","manipulation of viral cDNA","E2 coding sequence","rescue of classical swine fever viruses","E2gif","complete genome sequences of rescued viruses","construction of novel RNA genomes","BACs","E2 protein coding sequence","parental Riems sequence","RESULTS","Riems vaccine strain","extensive passages","new marker vaccine candidates","rescue of chimeric pestiviruses","high genetic stability","Infectious cDNA clones","new CSFV-BAC","full-length cDNAs present","CSFVs","D3431G","modifications","bacterial artificial chromosomes","potential","TAV","prerequisite","mammalian cells","powerful tool","pBeloR26","reversion","single amino acid substitution","BACKGROUND","Sequencing","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies of BRD focused on ante\u2010mortem samples from the upper respiratory tract and identified several unconventional viruses. The lung, however, is the primary location where significant BRD lesions are usually found and is a common post\u2010mortem diagnostic specimen. In this study, results of high\u2010throughput virome sequencing, bacterial culture, targeted real\u2010time PCR and histological examination of 130 bovine pneumonic lungs from western Canadian cattle were combined to explore associations of microorganisms with different types of pneumonia. Fibrinous bronchopneumonia (FBP) was the predominant type of pneumonia (46.2%, 60/130) and was associated with the detection of Mannheimia haemolytica. Detection of Histophilus somni and Pasteurella multocida was associated with suppurative bronchopneumonia (SBP) and concurrent bronchopneumonia and bronchointerstitial pneumonia (BP\u0026BIP), respectively. Sixteen viruses were identified, of which bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) was the most prevalent (11.5%, 15/130) followed by ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (UTPV1, 8.5%, 11/130) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV, 8.5%, 11/130). None of these viruses, however, were significantly associated with a particular type of pneumonia. Unconventional viruses such as influenza D virus (IDV) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) were detected, although sparsely, consistent with our previous findings in upper respiratory tract samples. Taken together, our results show that while virus detection in post\u2010mortem lung samples is of relatively little diagnostic value, the strong associations of H. somni and M. haemolytica with SBP and FBP, respectively, indicate that histopathology can be useful in differentiating bacterial aetiologies.","publish_time":"2019-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Maodong; Hill, Janet E.; Godson, Dale L.; Ngeleka, Musangu; Fernando, Champika; Huang, Yanyun","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88c2eb813652943ffb541445bb94521255acf728.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168541.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31715071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fibrinous","Pasteurella"],"organizations":["SBP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bovine respiratory syncytial virus","virus detection","bovine parvovirus","unconventional viruses","upper respiratory tract samples","bovine rhinitis B virus","pathogenesis of bovine respiratory disease","bronchointerstitial pneumonia","bovine pneumonic lungs","post\u2010mortem lung samples","predominant type of pneumonia","particular type of pneumonia","mortem samples","concurrent bronchopneumonia","influenza D virus","suppurative bronchopneumonia","Previous studies of BRD","Fibrinous bronchopneumonia","SBP","Detection of Histophilus somni","FBP","different types of pneumonia","detection of Mannheimia haemolytica","significant BRD lesions","bacterial culture","strong associations of","associations of microorganisms","previous findings","bacterial aetiologies","results of high","common post\u2010mortem diagnostic specimen","little diagnostic value","histological examination","targeted real\u2010time PCR","throughput virome sequencing","IDV","Pasteurella multocida","ante","western Canadian cattle","management","interplay of infectious agents","primary location","environmental factors","BRBV","aetiology","BRSV","study","BIP","histopathology","BPV2","ungulate tetraparvovirus","UTPV1"],"language":"en"},

Understanding of delirium pathophysiology is largely hypothetical, with some evidence for involvement of inflammatory systems, neurotransmitter alterations and glucose metabolism. To date, there has been limited empirical consideration of the distinction between delirium pathophysiology and that of the underlying disease, for example, cancer where these mechanisms are also common in advanced cancer syndromes such as pain and fatigue. This systematic review explores biomarker overlap in delirium, specific advanced cancer-related syndromes and prediction of cancer prognosis. METHODS: A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42017068662) was conducted, using MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Web of Science, to identify body fluid biomarkers in delirium, cancer prognosis and advanced cancer-related syndromes of interest. Studies were excluded if they reported delirium tremens only; did not measure delirium using a validated tool; the sample had less than 75% of participants with advanced cancer; measured tissue, genetic or animal biomarkers, or were conducted post-mortem. Articles were screened for inclusion independently by two authors, and data extraction and an in-depth quality assessment conducted by one author, and checked by two others. RESULTS: The 151 included studies were conducted in diverse settings in 32 countries between 1985 and 2017, involving 28130 participants with a mean age of 69.3 years. Seventy-one studies investigated delirium biomarkers, and 80 studies investigated biomarkers of an advanced cancer-related syndrome or cancer prognosis. Overall, 41 biomarkers were studied in relation to both delirium and either an advanced cancer-related syndrome or prognosis; and of these, 24 biomarkers were positively associated with either delirium or advanced cancer syndromes/prognosis in at least one study. The quality assessment showed large inconsistency in reporting. CONCLUSION: There is considerable overlap in the biomarkers in delirium and advanced cancer-related syndromes. Improving the design of delirium biomarker studies and considering appropriate comparator/controls will help to better understanding the discrete pathophysiology of delirium in the context of co-existing illness.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amgarth-Duff, Ingrid; Hosie, Annmarie; Caplan, Gideon; Agar, Meera","journal":"BMC Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/173fc8d9298f013d791e1e03cde5054994963986.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178636.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02584-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32321448/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["delirium biomarkers","advanced cancer syndromes","delirium pathophysiology","specific advanced cancer-related syndromes","prediction of cancer prognosis","discrete pathophysiology of delirium","design of delirium biomarker studies","animal biomarkers","body fluid biomarkers","included studies","systematic review","participants","in-depth quality assessment","considerable overlap","measured tissue","involvement of inflammatory systems","CINAHL","neurotransmitter alterations","Web of Science","neurocognitive disorder of physiological aetiology","Embase","data extraction","appropriate comparator","mechanisms","glucose metabolism","underlying disease","context of co-existing illness","MEDLINE","PubMed","evidence","PROSPERO CRD42017068662","large inconsistency","reporting","diverse settings","example","empirical consideration","distinction","pain","authors","mean age","METHODS","controls","validated tool","fatigue","inclusion","years","sample","countries","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","post-mortem","BACKGROUND","study","relation","Articles"],"language":"en"},

In many western countries travel clinics commonly perform medical consultations, vaccinations, and issue prescriptions. However, travel clinics are not yet popular in Japan. In 2011, Japanese society of travel and health (JSTH) began a support project for travel clinic with a goal of increasing their number throughout the country. The project included the release of a manual for education, training, equipment, details of medical treatment, sources of information for travel clinic opening on the JSTH website (http://jstah.umin.jp/20TravelClinicSupport/manual_20120726.pdf), and mediation of short-term visitation to experienced travel clinics registered in the JSTH to facilitate learning above information and aftercare services. JSTH accepted requests for visitation to travel clinics from 39 medical institutions between 2011 and 2018. By 2018, 26 (66.7%) of the 39 medical institutions had opened travel clinics within two years and the 25 travel clinics had registered in the JSTH and one was a campus-limited clinic, while most of the remaining institutions are still in preparation stages. The number of travel clinics registered in the JSTH has increased from 45 in 2011 to 108 in 2018. Twenty-five travel clinics registered in the JSTH between 2011 and 2018 were eventually receiving support from JSTH. Our data indicates travel clinics in Japan have gradually increased and establishment areas are expanding after the beginning of support project for travel clinics by JSTH.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watanabe, Hiroshi; Mizuno, Yasutaka; Kikuchi, Hitoshi; Miyagi, Kei; Takada, Kiyonori; Mishima, Nobuyuki; Okoshi, Hirofumi","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a75b70d464c2db0f5a6f3491f9493206ac655fad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128987.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2018.06.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X18301880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037756/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X18301880","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JSTH"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["number of travel clinics","Japanese society of travel","JSTH website","medical institutions","number of Japanese travelers","foreign travelers","medical consultations","beginning of support project","foreign countries","details of medical treatment","risk of travelers","remaining institutions","campus-limited clinic","sources of information","western countries","recent years","mediation of short-term visitation","equipment","education","manual","training","vaccinations","health","various infectious diseases","learning","goal","issue prescriptions","aftercare services","preparation stages","establishment areas","release","requests","data","Abstract","country"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to estimate the monthly incidence of MERS-CoV cases and to investigate their correlation to climate factors. METHODS: The study used aggregated monthly MERS-CoV cases that reported to the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control from the Riyadh Region between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Data on the meteorological situation throughout the study period was calculated based on Google reports on the Riyadh Region (24.7136 \u00B0N, 46.6753 \u00B0E). The Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each climate factor. RESULTS: A total of 712 MERS-CoV cases were included in the analysis (mean age 54.2 \u00B1 9.9 years), and more than half (404) (56.1%) MERS-CoV cases were diagnosed during a five-month period from April to August. The highest peak timing positioned in August 2015, followed by April 2014, June 2017, March 2015, and June 2016. High temperatures (IRR = 1.054, 95% CI: 1.043\u20131.065) and a high ultraviolet index (IRR = 1.401, 95% CI: 1.331\u20131.475) were correlated with a higher incidence of MERS-CoV cases. However, low relative humidity (IRR = 0.956, 95% CI: 0.948\u20130.964) and low wind speed (IRR = 0.945, 95% CI: 0.912\u20130.979) were correlated with a lower incidence of MERS-CoV cases. CONCLUSION: The novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, is influenced by climate conditions with increasing incidence between April and August. High temperature, high ultraviolet index, low wind speed, and low relative humidity are contributors to increased MERS-CoV cases. The climate factors must be evaluated in hospitals and community settings and integrated into guidelines to serve as source of control measures to prevent and eliminate the risk of infection.","publish_time":"2019-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Altamimi, Asmaa; Ahmed, Anwar E.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c1053307730d617cc748e9ede0e890fa06a992e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/df4645469a8c0c61657759d040fcfa97bbd63539.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102558.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187603411930351X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187603411930351X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31813836/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.11.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["aggregated monthly MERS-CoV cases","monthly incidence of MERS","lower incidence of MERS","higher incidence of MERS","IRR","increasing incidence","climate conditions","understanding of climate factors","low wind speed","low relative humidity","high ultraviolet index","High temperatures","study period","incidence rate ratio","Riyadh Region","novel coronavirus","month period","source of control measures","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","links","contributors","Disease Prevention","Saudi Center","Google reports","guidelines","meteorological situation","hospitals","analysis","outbreaks","total","correlation","years","mean age","community settings","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","confidence intervals","highest peak timing","Data","RESULTS","risk of infection","Poisson regression","half"],"language":"en"},

By using complete nucleotide sequences of S1 gene we determined the phylogeny of these IBV isolates, which in turn allowed us to define six lineages/genotypes, a number of recombinants and a novel variant. The GI-19 lineage was the most frequently isolated type in China in recent years. Although scattered mutations in the S1 gene among the GI-19 lineage viruses were observed, we also noted different sublineages in the GI-19 lineage with unique mutations, suggesting a high degree of S1 gene variation since they were first isolated in the mid-1990s. We also isolated a number of vaccine-like viruses from vaccinated diseased chickens, although more work is needed to differentiate the reisolation of vaccine strains from field strains of the same serotype. One of the important findings in this study is that the prevalence of the TW I type viruses in GI-7 lineage has been increasing in recent years in China. Another important finding is that recombination events occurred between the predominant GI-19 lineage and the commonly used 4/91 vaccine, which gave rise to distinct IBV isolates. In addition, a novel IBV isolate, together with a reference strain in GenBank database, were found to form a novel lineage/genotype that was remarkably distinct from established lineages. The characteristics of the antigenicity, tissue tropism, pathogenicity and complete genome were required for further investigation for the recombinants and the viruses in different sublineages and novel lineages. Meanwhile, permanent monitoring of circulating strains was needed to monitor the emerging viruses and rationally modify vaccination strategies in the field situation.","publish_time":"2018-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Liwen; Han, Zongxi; Jiang, Lei; Sun, Junfeng; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac4781f2079858a23e01dcbb93698d592ccabf6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185438.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.09.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818304192; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818304192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30244092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","TW"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["lineage viruses","emerging viruses","novel lineages","predominant GI","novel IBV isolate","isolated type","China","infectious bronchitis viruses","distinct IBV isolates","field strains","number of vaccine","novel variant","reisolation of vaccine strains","complete nucleotide sequences of S1 gene","number of recombinants","different sublineages","recent years","study","established lineages","high degree of S1 gene variation","complete genome","unique mutations","permanent monitoring of circulating strains","field situation","scattered mutations","important findings","tissue tropism","pathogenicity","recombination events","vaccination strategies","vaccinated diseased chickens","reference strain","antigenicity","work","IBVs","investigation","rise","phylogeny","GenBank database","characteristics","prevalence","genotypes","addition","turn","TW","samples","flocks","serotype"],"language":"en"},

With its recent outbreaks in Europe, there is a pressing need for efficacious antivirals. We presented here the identification and characterization of a novel virostatic molecule against BTV, an aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivative named compound 003 (C003). The virostatic efficacy of C003 could be improved via chemical modification, leading to a de novo synthesized compound 052 (C052). The 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)) of C003 and C052 were determined at 1.76\u00B10.73 \u00B5M and 0.27\u00B10.12 \u00B5M, respectively. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC(50)) of C003 was over 100 \u00B5M and the CC(50) of C052 was at 82.69 \u00B5M. Accordingly, the 50% selective index (SI(50)) of C003 and C052 against BTV was over 57 and 306, respectively. The inhibitory effect of C003/C052 on BTV-induced apoptosis was also confirmed via the inhibition of caspase-3/-7 activation post BTV infection. C003/C052 could inhibit BTV induced CPE even when added as late as 24 h.p.i., indicating that they might act at late stage of viral life-cycle. C003/C052 could reduce over two-logs of both the progeny virus production and the number of genomic viral RNA copies. Interestingly, both the activation of host autophagy and viral protein expression were inhibited post BTV infection when cells were treated with C003 and C052, suggesting that C003/C052 might act as virostatic agents via inhibiting host autophagy activation. Although further investigations might be needed to pin down the exact mechanism of C003/C052, our finding suggested that these compounds might be potent lead compounds with potential novel mechanism of action against BTV.","publish_time":"2012-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Linlin; Musiienko, Volodymyr; Bai, Zhijun; Qin, Aijian; Schneller, Stewart W.; Li, Qianjun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7366b56a55321eebcb1d38074932d23ad4346038.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3419696.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22905259/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0043341","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BTV","EC"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["C052","virostatic efficacy of C003","exact mechanism of C003","inhibitory effect of C003","\u00B5M","activation post BTV infection","BTV-induced apoptosis","BTV induced CPE","inhibited post BTV infection","activation of host autophagy","novel virostatic molecule","virostatic agents","inhibiting host autophagy activation","CC","viral protein expression","late stage of viral life-cycle","potential novel mechanism of action","Bluetongue virus","number of genomic viral RNA copies","potent lead compounds","progeny virus production","novo synthesized compound","re-emerging animal disease infecting cattle","cells","aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivative","sheep","family Reoviridae","Europe","pressing need","characterization","member","logs","efficacious antivirals","identification","finding","chemical modification","effective concentrations","selective index","recent outbreaks","inhibition of caspase","cytotoxicity concentration","investigations"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The study included 48 patients diagnosed with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy surgery. Prior to dacryocystorhinostomy surgery, nasal swab sample was taken from the inferior meatus at the same side. During dacryocystorhinostomy, tissue biopsy sample (2 \u00D7 2 mm) was taken from the junction area of the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct. Following nucleic acid extraction, polymerase chain reaction was performed. RESULTS: The patients consisted of 9 (18.8%) men and 39 (81.2%) women with a mean age of 51.0 \u00B1 14.3 years. Qualitative polymerase chain reaction showed viral genome in the nasal swabs of 10 (20.8%) patients, including coronavirus 229E (three cases), coronavirus HKU1 (two cases), respiratory syncytial virus (two cases), coronavirus OC43 (one case), coronavirus NL63 (one case), and adenovirus (one case). In the dacryocystorhinostomy samples, viral genomes were detected in four (8.3%) cases, including respiratory syncytial virus (two cases), coronavirus HKU1 (one case), and adenovirus (one case). There was a statistically significant agreement between nasal mucosal swab and dacryocystorhinostomy biopsy samples in terms of respiratory syncytial virus positivity (kappa = 1.000, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although the viral genome was detected in the samples, a direct relationship between viruses and pathogenesis of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction could not be revealed because of the low number of positive results. However, considering the profibrotic characteristics of specific viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus, viral infections may be one of the many predisposing factors of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction.","publish_time":"2019-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan\u0131k, \u00D6zge; Ho\u015Fal, Banu; Tekeli, Alper; Nalc\u0131, Hilal","journal":"Eur J Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06359914cd30a01242bc28b23f91b4c7fdc46de8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7140976.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630558/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1120672119882331","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases","nasolacrimal duct obstruction","dacryocystorhinostomy samples","dacryocystorhinostomy surgery","coronavirus HKU1","dacryocystorhinostomy biopsy samples","pathogenesis of primary","viral genomes","coronavirus OC43","coronavirus NL63","adenovirus","patients","terms of respiratory syncytial virus positivity","role of viral infections","nasal swab sample","nasal mucosal swab","predisposing factors of primary","nasal swabs","Qualitative polymerase chain reaction","tissue biopsy sample","profibrotic characteristics of specific viruses","low number of positive results","nucleic acid extraction","lacrimal sac","kappa","significant agreement","direct relationship","junction area","mean age","study","inferior meatus","women","years","METHODS","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

This study further demonstrated that TSL-1 inhibited pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus activity through preventing attachment of A549 cells but not penetration. TSL-1 inhibited viral attachment through significant downregulation of adhesion molecules and chemokines (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, IL-8, and fractalkine) compared to Amantadine.

This study attempted to quantify the effect of such changes on the risk of infection in different settings, i.e., the community and hospitals. The 2002\u20132003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, where 27% of cases were healthcare workers, was used as an example. A stochastic compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model was used: the population was split into healthcare workers, hospitalized people and general population. Super spreading events (SSEs) were taken into account in the model. The temporal evolutions of the daily effective contact rates in the community and hospitals were modeled with smooth functions. Data augmentation techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were applied to estimate SARS epidemiological parameters. In particular, estimates of daily reproduction numbers were provided for each subpopulation. The average duration of the SARS infectious period was estimated to be 9.3 days (\u00B10.3 days). The model was able to disentangle the impact of the two SSEs from background transmission rates. The effective contact rates, which were estimated on a daily basis, decreased with time, reaching zero inside hospitals. This observation suggests that public health measures and possible changes in individual behaviors effectively reduced transmission, especially in hospitals. The temporal patterns of reproduction numbers were similar for healthcare workers and the general population, indicating that on average, an infectious healthcare worker did not infect more people than any other infectious person. We provide a general method to estimate time dependence of parameters in structured epidemic models, which enables investigation of the impact of control measures and behavioral changes in different settings.","publish_time":"2009-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cori, Anne; Bo\u00EBlle, Pierre-Yves; Thomas, Guy; Leung, Gabriel M.; Valleron, Alain-Jacques","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/933a1b843db9eb0d98835f9359622ba8cb8bdc05.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dcf12f1f76ae03b3107f00aadea540298105d312.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5a55cfceb7365142481967c11c4f70b359a1e4b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2717369.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19696879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["hospitals","healthcare workers","general population","infectious healthcare worker","SARS infectious period","possible changes","behavioral changes","daily effective contact rates","infectious person","daily reproduction numbers","intervention-related changes","impact of control measures","outbreak control","community","SARS epidemiological parameters","different settings","general method","SSEs","background transmission rates","daily basis","days","temporal patterns of reproduction numbers","time dependence of parameters","individual behaviors","reduced transmission","hospitalized people","temporal evolutions","average duration","public health measures","Markov chain Monte Carlo","methods","investigation","Data augmentation techniques","structured epidemic models","course of epidemics","MCMC","key issue","severe acute respiratory syndrome","risk of infection","Hong Kong","stochastic compartmental SEIR","extent","Super spreading events","observation","cases","smooth functions","subpopulation","account","study","example"],"language":"en"},

Despite this, a safe and effective PEDV vaccine against highly virulent strains is unavailable, making PEDV prevention and control challenging. Lactogenic immunity induced via the gut-mammary gland-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, remains the most promising and effective way to protect suckling piglets from PEDV. Therefore, a successful PEDV vaccine must induce protective maternal IgA antibodies that passively transfer into colostrum and milk. Identifying variables that influence lymphocyte migration and IgA secretion during gestation and lactation is imperative for designing maternal immunization strategies that generate the highest amount of lactogenic immune protection against PEDV in suckling piglets. Because pregnancy-associated immune alterations influence viral pathogenesis and adaptive immune responses in many different species, a better understanding of host immune responses to PEDV in pregnant swine may translate into improved maternal immunization strategies against enteric pathogens for multiple species.

The objective of this study is to compare the outcomes of MERS-CoV patients before and after the availability of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a rescue therapy in severely hypoxemic patients who failed conventional strategies. METHODS: We collected data retrospectively on MERS-CoV patients with refractory respiratory failure from April 2014 to December 2015 in 5 intensive care units (ICUs) in Saudi Arabia. Patients were classified into two groups: ECMO versus conventional therapy. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included; 17 received ECMO and 18 received conventional therapy. Both groups had similar baseline characteristics. The ECMO group had lower in-hospital mortality (65 vs. 100%, P = 0.02), longer ICU stay (median 25 vs. 8 days, respectively, P \u003C 0.01), and similar hospital stay (median 41 vs. 31 days, P = 0.421).

One ORF encoded a protein of 170 amino acids and the other ORF, located adjacent to the 3\u2032 noncoding region of the viral genome, encoded a 114 amino acid protein. Thirty-three N-terminal residues were sequenced directly from purified LDV capsid protein, Vpi, and this amino acid sequence mapped to the ORF adjacent to the 3\u2032 noncoding region.

Automated image acquisition has significantly reduced the time and effort required to determine the structures of macromolecular assemblies. As a result, the number of structures determined by cryo-EM is growing exponentially. However, there is an urgent need for improved criteria for validating both the reconstruction process and the atomic models derived from cryo-EM data. Another major challenge will be mitigating the effects of anisotropy caused by the missing wedge and the excessively low signal-to-noise ratio for tomographic data.

In recent years, CHIKV has gained considerable attention due to its quick spread to the Caribbean and then in the Americas, with many cases reported between 2014 and 2017. CHIKV has further garnered attention due to the clinical diagnostic difficulties when Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) viruses are simultaneously present. In this review, topical CHIKV-related issues, such as epidemiology and transmission, are examined. The different manifestations of infection (acute, chronic and atypical) are described and a particular focus is placed upon the diagnostic handling in the case of ZIKV and DENV co-circulating. Natural and synthetic compounds under evaluation for treatment of chikungunya disease, including drugs already licensed for other purposes, are also discussed.

Here, we analyzed genes encoding selected natural killer cell receptors with a special focus on genes encoding receptors for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands in the two domestic camel species, Camelus dromedarius and Camelus bactrianus. Based on the dromedary genome assembly CamDro2, we characterized the genetic contents, organization, and variability of two complex genomic regions, the leukocyte receptor complex and the natural killer complex, along with the natural cytotoxicity receptor genes NCR1, NCR2, and NCR3. The genomic organization of the natural killer complex region of camels differs from cattle, the phylogenetically most closely related species. With its minimal set of KLR genes, it resembles this complex in the domestic pig. Similarly, the leukocyte receptor complex of camels is strikingly different from its cattle counterpart. With KIR pseudogenes and few LILR genes, it seems to be simpler than in the pig. The syntenies and protein sequences of the NCR1, NCR2, and NCR3 genes in the dromedary suggest that they could be human orthologues. However, only NCR1 and NCR2 have a structure of functional genes, while NCR3 appears to be a pseudogene. High sequence similarities between the two camel species as well as with the alpaca Vicugna pacos were observed. The polymorphism in all genes analyzed seems to be generally low, similar to the rest of the camel genomes. This first report on natural killer cell receptor genes in camelids adds new data to our understanding of specificities of the camel immune system and its functions, extends our genetic knowledge of the innate immune variation in dromedaries and Bactrian camels, and contributes to studies of natural killer cell receptors evolution in mammals.","publish_time":"2019-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Futas, Jan; Oppelt, Jan; Jelinek, April; Elbers, Jean P.; Wijacki, Jan; Knoll, Ales; Burger, Pamela A.; Horin, Petr","journal":"Front Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ac39b49492fe7a6f53ad50d840e4ce8ed579e77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6614441.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312212/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NCR3 genes","natural killer cell receptor genes","LILR genes","major histocompatibility complex genes","T-cell receptor genes","natural cytotoxicity receptor genes NCR1","natural killer complex region of camels","leukocyte receptor complex of camels","structure of functional genes","selected natural killer cell receptors","complex genomic regions","studies of natural killer cell receptors evolution","minimal set of KLR genes","NCR2","domestic camel species","Bactrian camels","camel genomes","camel immune system","genomic organization","related species","domestic pig","special focus","low diversity","Camelus dromedarius","genetic knowledge","Camelus bactrianus","genetic contents","immunogenetic studies","cattle counterpart","innate immune variation","dromedary genome assembly CamDro2","production of special homodimeric heavy chain antibodies","somatic hypermutation","camelids","new data","understanding of specificities","variability","class","MHC","ligands","important model","dromedaries","functions","mammals","report","rest","protein sequences","High sequence similarities","syntenies","KIR pseudogenes","alpaca Vicugna pacos","human orthologues","polymorphism"],"language":"en"},

Although respiratory symptoms usually dominate the clinical presentation, COVID-19 is now known to also have potentially serious cardiovascular consequences, including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. The cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 might be related to the adrenergic drive, systemic inflammatory milieu and cytokine-release syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, direct viral infection of myocardial and endothelial cells, hypoxia due to respiratory failure, electrolytic imbalances, fluid overload, and side effects of certain COVID-19 medications. COVID-19 has profoundly reshaped usual care of both ambulatory and acute cardiac patients, by leading to the cancellation of elective procedures and by reducing the efficiency of existing pathways of urgent care, respectively. Decreased utilization of healthcare services for acute conditions by non-COVID-19 patients has also been reported and attributed to concerns about acquiring in-hospital infection. Innovative approaches that leverage modern technologies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic have been introduced, which include telemedicine, dissemination of educational material over social media, smartphone apps for case tracking, and artificial intelligence for pandemic modelling, among others.

Public health agencies could use social media outlets, such as Twitter, to assess how the public makes sense of an EID outbreak and to create adaptive messages in communicating with the public during different stages of the crisis.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Lu; Bie, Bijie; Zhi, Degui","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c42947c501aafb02c809685dc975a791b2db04d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115278.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29929837/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655318306710; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2018.05.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655318306710","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID"],"locations":["United States","Disneyland Park"],"keyphrases":["public opinions","public health agencies","public discussed measles","EIDs","social media outlets","social media discussions","frames","measles outbreak","EID outbreak","study","Method","pre-crisis","resolution stages","different stages","semantic network analysis","quantification of semantic networks","news update","co-occurrence","corse","word frequencies","maintenance","interpretation","information","vaccination","content","Anaheim","emerging infectious diseases","creation","adaptive messages","Twitter","tweets","individual frame","Disneyland Park","emotions","coping strategies","United States","sense","sentiments","KH coder","prominence","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

Recent reports of two novel IAVs in fruit bats and serological evidence of avian influenza virus (AIV) H9 infection in frugivorous bats raise questions about the role of bats in IAV epidemiology. IAVs bind to sialic acid (SA) receptors on host cells, and it is widely believed that hosts expressing both SA \u03B12,3-Gal and SA \u03B12,6-Gal receptors could facilitate genetic reassortment of avian and human IAVs. We found abundant co-expression of both avian (SA \u03B12,3-Gal) and human (SA \u03B12,6-Gal) type SA receptors in little brown bats (LBBs) that were compatible with avian and human IAV binding.

Population-based studies examining etiology and incidence are lacking. This study examined the incidence and etiology of CAP requiring hospitalization in a population-based cohort as well as risk factors and outcomes for specific etiologies. METHODS: Consecutive admissions due to CAP in Reykjavik, Iceland were studied. Etiologic testing was performed with cultures, urine-antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction analysis of airway samples. Outcomes were length of stay, intensive care unit admission, assisted ventilation, and mortality. RESULTS: The inclusion rate was 95%. The incidence of CAP requiring hospitalization was 20.6 cases per 10000 adults/year. A potential pathogen was detected in 52% (164 of 310) of admissions and in 74% (43 of 58) with complete sample sets. Streptococcuspneumoniae was the most common pathogen (61 of 310, 20%; incidence: 4.1/10000). Viruses were identified in 15% (47 of 310; incidence: 3.1/10000), Mycoplasmapneumoniae were identified in 12% (36 of 310; incidence: 2.4/10000), and multiple pathogens were identified in 10% (30 of 310; incidence: 2.0/10000). Recent antimicrobial therapy was associated with increased detection of M pneumoniae (P \u003C .001), whereas a lack of recent antimicrobial therapy was associated with increased detection of S pneumoniae (P = .02). Symptoms and outcomes were similar irrespective of microbial etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococci, M pneumoniae, and viruses are the most common pathogens associated with CAP requiring hospital admission, and they all have a similar incidence that increases with age. Symptoms do not correlate with specific agents, and outcomes are similar irrespective of pathogens identified.","publish_time":"2018-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bjarnason, Agnar; Westin, Johan; Lindh, Magnus; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Kristinsson, Karl G; L\u00F6ve, Arthur; Baldursson, Olafur; Gottfredsson, Magnus","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e45740f4d2001e92d14d657feef0191f769cb61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5804852.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29479548/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofy010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":["Reykjavik"],"keyphrases":["incidence of CAP","similar incidence","etiology of CAP","outcomes","common pathogens","microbial etiology of community","increased detection of S pneumoniae","hospitalization","Population-based studies","multiple pathogens","Viruses","Symptoms","lack of recent antimicrobial therapy","urine-antigen detection","population-based cohort","previous studies","hospital admission","specific etiologies","specific agents","variable results","Consecutive admissions","potential pathogen","intensive care unit admission","polymerase chain reaction analysis of airway samples","risk factors","length of stay","ventilation","cultures","clinical practice","Reykjavik","cases","adults","Pneumococci","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Etiologic testing","complete sample sets","year","inclusion rate","mortality","CONCLUSIONS","Streptococcuspneumoniae","Iceland","study","Mycoplasmapneumoniae"],"language":"en"},

The identification of aphid genes and proteins mediating virus transmission is critical to develop agriculturally sustainable virus management practices and to understand viral strategies for circulative movement in all insect vectors. Two cyclophilin B proteins, S28 and S29, were identified previously in populations of Schizaphisgraminum that differed in their ability to transmit the RPV strain of Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV-RPV). The presence of S29 was correlated with F2 genotypes that were efficient virus transmitters. The present study revealed the two proteins were isoforms, and a single amino acid change distinguished S28 and S29. The distribution of the two alleles was determined in 12 F2 genotypes segregating for CYDV-RPV transmission capacity and in 11 genetically independent, field-collected S . graminum biotypes. Transmission efficiency for CYDV-RPV was determined in all genotypes and biotypes. The S29 isoform was present in all genotypes or biotypes that efficiently transmit CYDV-RPV and more specifically in genotypes that efficiently transport virus across the hindgut. We confirmed a direct interaction between CYDV-RPV and both S28 and S29 using purified virus and bacterially expressed, his-tagged S28 and S29 proteins. Importantly, S29 failed to interact with a closely related virus that is transported across the aphid midgut. We tested for in vivo interactions using an aphid-virus co-immunoprecipitation strategy coupled with a bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. This analysis enabled us to identify a third cyclophilin protein, cyclophilin A, interacting directly or in complex with purified CYDV-RPV. Taken together, these data provide evidence that both cyclophilin A and B interact with CYDV-RPV, and these interactions may be important but not sufficient to mediate virus transport from the hindgut lumen into the hemocoel.","publish_time":"2013-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tamborindeguy, Cecilia; Bereman, Michael S.; DeBlasio, Stacy; Igwe, David; Smith, Dawn M.; White, Frank; MacCoss, Michael J.; Gray, Stewart M.; Cilia, Michelle","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a50f42269649e20ec3580496c72923ef1c4abd6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3739738.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23951206/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus transmission","purified virus","virus transport","purified CYDV-RPV","related virus","S29 proteins","CYDV-RPV transmission capacity","RPV strain of Cereal yellow dwarf virus","efficient virus transmitters","S29 isoform","presence of S29","F2 genotypes","aphid-virus co-immunoprecipitation strategy","cyclophilin B proteins","sustainable virus management practices","important virus diseases of cereal crops","aphid vectors","distinguished S28","aphid midgut","cyclophilin protein","MS analysis","Transmission efficiency","identification of aphid genes","interactions","graminum biotypes","Yellow dwarf viruses","LC-MS","present study","hindgut lumen","insect vectors","viral strategies","single amino acid","circulative movement","Q Exactive mass spectrometer","isoforms","ability","evidence","alleles","direct interaction","complex","field","hemocoel","populations of Schizaphisgraminum","data","distribution"],"language":"en"},

Announcing that the country was at \u201Cwar,\u201D President Macron called upon all to play a role in mitigating against further development of contagion. This extreme measure never seen before during peace time was the result of adapting not only the French Pandemic Influenza Plan (PIP) being applied to the national context but also real-time clinical, epidemiological, and scientific information about the evolution of COVID-19 infection in the country. The situation was further complicated by local municipal elections and political agendas by populist opinions. Despite mass communication about the importance of individual behavioral attitudes to counter disease propagation, few heeded government advice. Consequently, the situation rapidly deteriorated with increasing number of cases that started to overwhelm health services.

This study investigated the association between influenza A viruses co-infection with hBoV and hCoV and severity and the sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for identification of 15 coronaviruses. METHODOLOGY: Published sequences for the 15 human coronaviruses were used to design a consensus PCR targeting the replicase open reading frame 1b. A previously published PCR targeting the NS1 Gene of all known human bocavirus strains was also utilized. A series of 217 samples from patients aged 37.7 (SD \u00B1 30.4)] with seasonal influenza A viruses (SeasFluA) identified between 06/2011 and 06/2012 in NW England were tested for hCoV and hBoV using RT-PCR. Association between co-infection and disease outcome was assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The limit of detection of hCoV RT-PCR assay was 2 copies/\u00B5l of human coronavirus RNA template, a sensitivity comparable to a previously published SYBR green assay for human coronaviruses. A total of 12 hCoV and 17 hBoV were identified in the 217 influenza A positive samples. A higher proportion (61.5 %; 8/13) of SeasFluA/hBoV co-infections were identified in patients that were admitted either to a general ward or the intensive care unit compared to 44.3 % (66/149) of single SeasFlu A virus infections (OR 2.5 95 % CI 0.67\u20139.34, p = 0.17). In a stratified analysis, there was a trend towards higher association between FluA, hCoV and hBoV with increasing age (especially in patients aged 24\u201345 years and \u003E65 year old). CONCLUSION: Our hCoV RT-PCR protocol appeared to be of adequate analytical sensitivity for diagnosis. More and larger studies are needed to confirm the role of hCoV, hBoV in causing severe disease when they co-infect with influenza A viruses.","publish_time":"2014-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goka, E.

These limitations are disappearing with the advent of methodologies such as microarrays that facilitate rapid characterization of global gene expression at the level of individual cells and tissues. The present review focuses on the use of microarray technologies to investigate the functional pathogenomics of infectious disease in cattle. We discuss a number of unique issues that must be addressed when designing both in vitro and in vivo model systems to analyze host responses to a specific pathogen. Furthermore, comparative functional genomic strategies are discussed that can be used to address questions regarding host responses that are either common to a variety of pathogens or unique to individual pathogens. These strategies can also be applied to investigations of cell signaling pathways and the analyses of innate immune responses. Microarray analyses of both host and pathogen responses hold substantial promise for the generation of databases that can be used in the future to address a wide variety of questions. A critical component limiting these comparative analyses will be the quality of the databases and the complete functional annotation of the bovine genome. These limitations are discussed with an indication of future developments that will accelerate the validation of data generated when completing a molecular characterization of disease pathogenesis in cattle.","publish_time":"2005-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Heather L.; Aich, Palok; Roche, Fiona M.; Jalal, Shakiba; Hodgson, Paul D.; Brinkman, Fiona S.L.; Potter, Andy; Babiuk, Lorne A.; Griebel, Philip J.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bde3798df501fc40dd89e2cff0a1a8fd2b9dd47.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112672.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242705000413; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242705000413","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host responses","pathogen responses","cattle","Microarray analyses","comparative analyses","analyses of innate immune responses","molecular characterization of disease pathogenesis","functional pathogenomics of infectious disease","individual pathogens","molecular analysis of disease pathogenesis","variety of pathogens","specific pathogen","comparative functional genomic strategies","limitations","complete functional annotation","wide variety of questions","generation of databases","level of individual cells","use of microarray technologies","indication of future developments","number of unique issues","rapid characterization of global gene expression","substantial promise","microarrays","pathways","bovine genome","tools","quality","advent of methodologies","tissues","investigations of cell","validation of data","lack of availability","critical component","model systems","present review"],"language":"en"},

The southern bent-winged bat (Miniopterus orianae bassanii) is a critically endangered subspecies endemic to south-eastern Australia. Population numbers of this bat have been declining for the past 50 years, but the reasons for this are unclear. As part of a larger study to determine if disease could be a contributing factor to this decline, 351 southern bent-winged bats from four locations were captured, and oral swabs were collected and tested for the presence of potentially pathogenic viruses. Results were compared with those obtained from 116 eastern bent-winged bats (Miniopterus orianae oceanensis) from three different locations. The eastern bent-winged bat is a related but more common and widespread subspecies whose geographical range overlaps partly with southern bent-winged bats. Herpesviruses were detected in bent-winged bats from all seven locations. At least six novel herpesviruses (five betaherpesviruses and one gammaherpesvirus) were identified. The prevalence of herpesvirus infection was higher in eastern bent-winged bats (44%, 51/116), compared to southern bent-winged bats (27%, 95/351), although this varied across the locations and sampling periods. Adenoviruses and a range of different RNA viruses (lyssaviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses and henipaviruses) were also tested for but not detected. The detected herpesviruses did not appear to be associated with obvious ill health, and may thus not be playing a role in the population decline of the southern bent-winged bat. The detection of multiple novel herpesviruses at a high prevalence of infection is consistent with our understanding of bats as hosts to a rich diversity of viruses.","publish_time":"2018-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holz, Peter H.; Lumsden, Linda F.; Druce, Julian; Legione, Alistair R.; Vaz, Paola; Devlin, Joanne M.; Hufschmid, Jasmin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8a09ce3cbd5d88ceb3bb530003b2f4a46d92d3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5967723.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29795610/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["southern bent-winged bats","eastern bent-winged bats","understanding of bats","detected herpesviruses","different locations","bat populations","range of different RNA viruses","detection of multiple novel herpesviruses","pathogenic viruses","decline","Miniopterus orianae bassanii","Miniopterus orianae oceanensis","high prevalence of infection","prevalence of herpesvirus infection","rich diversity of viruses","widespread subspecies","Population numbers","geographical range overlaps","endangered subspecies endemic","carriers of infectious disease agents","lyssaviruses","filoviruses","little research","hosts","south-eastern Australia","coronaviruses","potential pathogens","contributing factor","reasons","effects","henipaviruses","Adenoviruses","betaherpesviruses","obvious ill health","years","larger study","presence","oral swabs","sampling periods","gammaherpesvirus","role","Results"],"language":"en"},

While many viruses are studied to seek solutions for their adverse impact on human, veterinary, and plant health, the study of baculoviruses was stimulated initially by their potential utility to control insect pests. Later, the utility of baculovirus as gene expression vectors was evidenced leading to numerous applications. Several strategies are employed to obtain recombinant viruses that express large quantities of heterologous proteins. A major step forward was the development of bacmid technology (the construction of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing the genome of the baculovirus) which allows the manipulation of the baculovirus genome in bacteria. With this technology, foreign genes can be introduced into the bacmid by homologous and site-directed recombination or by transposition. Baculoviruses have been used to explore fundamental questions in molecular biology such as the nature of programmed cell-death. Moreover, the ability of baculoviruses to transduce mammalian cells led to the consideration of their use as gene-therapy and vaccine vectors. Strategies for genetic engineering of baculoviruses have been developed to meet the requirements of new application areas. Display of foreign proteins on the surface of virions or in nucleocapsid structures, the assembly of expressed proteins to form virus-like particles or protein complexes have been explored and validated as vaccines. The aim of this chapter is to update the areas of application of the baculoviruses in protein expression, alternative vaccine designs and gene therapy of infectious diseases and genetic disorders. Finally, we review the baculovirus-derived products on the market and in the pipeline for biomedical and veterinary use.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fabre, M.

Immune damage mediated by cytokine storms and concomitant AKI is a key factor for poor prognosis. Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19. This protocol is divided into four major steps. The first step is to assess whether patients with severe COVID-19 require blood purification. The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19. The third step is to monitor and adjust parameters of blood purification. The fourth step is to evaluate the timing of discontinuation of blood purification. It is expected that blood purification will play a key role in effectively reducing the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 through the standardized implementation of the present protocol.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Xiang-Hong; Sun, Ren-Hua; Zhao, Ming-Yan; Chen, Er-Zhen; Liu, Jiao; Wang, Hong-Liang; Yang, Rong-Li; Chen, De-Chang","journal":"Chronic Dis Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ca693f4016c1783c577c90a900c024716448ed4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186198.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095882X20300372; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095882X20300372; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346492/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["AKI"],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Wuhan","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","blood purification protocol","blood purification treatment","parameters of blood purification","previous experience of blood purification","mortality of patients","severe disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome","subsequent outbreak of COVID","respiratory system","present protocol","Middle East respiratory syndrome","concomitant AKI","key factor","key role","major complication","major steps","Coronavirus disease","acute kidney injury","World Health Organization","public health emergency of international concern","clinical front-line practice","cytokine storms","standardized implementation","impairment","Immune damage","poor prognosis","timing of discontinuation","addition","Epidemiological data","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

In this report, we briefly review and discuss the different reverse genetic systems developed for CoVs, paying special attention to the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV).","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando; Sola, Isabel; Zu\u00F1iga, Sonia; Marquez-Jurado, Silvia; Morales, Lucia; Becares, Martina; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f7147ff48627db0fbec7fe2f55cbded6f0069a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114485.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261606/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003827; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003827","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","CoV genome","CoVs","severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV","CoV replicase gene sequences","different reverse genetic systems","development of reverse genetic systems similar","propagation","hepatic","special attention","instability","serious obstacles","bacteria","humans","smaller positive sense RNA viruses","central nervous system diseases","alternatives","conventional plasmid-based approaches","Abstract Coronaviruses","animal species","large size","limitations","years","report"],"language":"en"},

This finding indicated that the recent Thai IBVs evolved separately and that at least three groups of viruses are circulating in Thailand. The recombination analysis of the S1 gene demonstrated that the 5\u2032-terminus of the group I was similar to isolate THA001 which was unique to Thailand, isolated in 1998 whereas the 3\u2032-terminus was similar to the group II.

Viral particles of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV-8) have been recently examined.

A proteome database of B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), before and after transformation, has been developed to identify the cellular mechanisms of virus-induced immortalization. 2DE is used to first separate proteins based on their relative charge (pI) and then based on their molecular weight.

A new ensemble of 20 conformers representing the NMR structure of the NAB, which was calculated with an input containing backbone torsion angle constraints derived from the theoretical (13)C(\u03B1) chemical shifts as supplementary data to the NOE distance constraints, exhibits very similar topology and comparable agreement with the NOE constraints as the published NMR structure. However, the two structures differ in the patterns of differences between observed and computed (13)C(\u03B1) chemical shifts, \u0394(ca,i), for the individual residues along the sequence.

Functional RNA domains can interact with other regions of the viral genome and/or proteins to direct viral translation, replication and encapsidation.

A toxoid vaccine for use in sows has been developed and studied in field trials. The European Pharmacopoeia Monograph on vaccines for use in animals lays down a method of the efficacy testing based on the immunization of rabbits, the collection of pooled sera and the subsequent assay of anti-toxin antibodies in mice using an appropriate test toxin. The vaccine is regarded as effective if it induces a minimum of 10 IU of \u03B2-anti-toxin per ml of rabbit serum. We have established a range of 17.14\u201398.23 IU \u03B2-anti-toxin per ml rabbit serum induced by a sample of C. perfringens toxoid vaccine. The vaccine has been used under field conditions in different rearing units at the same time, mostly in the form of emergency vaccinations following the outbreak of disease. The outcome of vaccination was evaluated by recording the total numbers of piglets born alive and the piglet losses. Use of the vaccine, coupled with other measures, resulted in an approximately 30% reduction in the number of losses.","publish_time":"1999-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Springer, S; Selbitz, H.-J","journal":"FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a05fd132ae9383dfe882058bb614ef227c54760.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172454.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928824499000504; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928824499000504","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B2-toxin","IU \u03B2-anti-toxin","use","perfringens toxoid vaccine","IU of \u03B2","appropriate test toxin","subsequent assay of anti-toxin antibodies","rabbit serum","piglet losses","outbreak of disease","different rearing units","sucking piglets","field conditions","number of losses","field trials","Clostridium perfringens type","total numbers of piglets","mice","serious problem","collection of pooled sera","primary causal agent","vaccines","sample of","immunization of rabbits","high morbidity","decisive role","European Pharmacopoeia Monograph","form of emergency vaccinations","method","animals","time","mortality","efficacy testing","Necrotic enteritis","pathogenesis","minimum","sows","reduction","range","outcome of vaccination","measures"],"language":"en"},

We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection.

Through their diverse polysaccharide structures they can potentiate a myriad of cellular signaling pathways involved in development, growth, immuno-communication and survival. Not surprisingly, disruption of glycan synthesis is fundamental to various human diseases; including cancer, where aberrant glycosylation drives malignancy. Here, we report the discovery of a novel mannose-binding lectin, ML6, which selectively recognizes and binds to these irregular tumor-specific glycans to elicit potent and rapid cancer cell death. This lectin was engineered from gene models identified in a tropical rainforest tree root transcriptome and is unusual in its six canonical mannose binding domains (QxDxNxVxY), each with a unique amino acid sequence. Remarkably, ML6 displays antitumor activity that is \u003E10(5) times more potent than standard chemotherapeutics, while being almost completely inactive towards non-transformed, healthy cells. This activity, in combination with results from glycan binding studies, suggests ML6 differentiates healthy and malignant cells by exploiting divergent glycosylation pathways that yield na\u00EFve and incomplete cell surface glycans in tumors. Thus, ML6 and other high-valence lectins may serve as novel biochemical tools to elucidate the glycomic signature of different human tumors and aid in the rational design of carbohydrate-directed therapies. Further, understanding how nature evolves proteins, like ML6, to combat the changing defenses of competing microorganisms may allow for fundamental advances in the way we approach combinatorial therapies to fight therapeutic resistance in cancer.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawanprasert, Atip; Guinan, Caitlin A.; Langford, Erica A.; Hawkins, Carly E.; Sloand, Janna N.; Fescemyer, Howard W.; Aronson, Matthew R.; Halle, Jacob A.; Marden, James H.; Medina, Scott H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d45434768bff438c55a2ec36d9821e40fe7ddc7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7041804.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32097449/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ML6","novel mannose-binding lectin","glycan binding studies","healthy cells","proteins","incomplete cell surface glycans","rapid cancer cell death","canonical mannose binding domains","divergent glycosylation pathways","malignant cells","fundamental advances","combinatorial therapies","irregular tumor-specific glycans","antitumor activity","glycomic signature of different human tumors","various human diseases","novel biochemical tools","disruption of glycan synthesis","aberrant glycosylation drives malignancy","aid","tropical rainforest tree root transcriptome","growth","development","rational design of carbohydrate","QxDxNxVxY","combination","results","high-valence lectins","gene models","changing defenses of competing microorganisms","immuno-communication","therapeutic resistance","multi-branched sugars","myriad of cellular","standard chemotherapeutics","unique amino acid sequence","survival","lipids","times","discovery","diverse polysaccharide structures"],"language":"en"},

Here, using bovine coronavirus (BCoV)\u2010defective interfering (DI) RNA, we showed that (a) a poly(A) tail with a length of 15 nucleotides (nt) was sufficient to initiate efficient (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis and (b) substitution of the poly(A) tail with poly(U), (C) or (G) only slightly decreased the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis. The findings indicate that in addition to the poly(A) tail, other factors acting in trans may also participate in (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis. The BCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein, an RNA\u2010binding protein, was therefore tested as a candidate. Based on dissociation constant (K(d)) values, it was found that the binding affinity between N protein, but not poly(A)\u2010binding protein, and the 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus a poly(A), poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail correlates with the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis.

Further analysis demonstrated that N protein can act as a bridge to facilitate interaction between the 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010ends of the CoV genome, leading to circularization of the genome.

So far, no successful specific treatment has been found for this disease. As has been reported, most of non-survivor patients with COVID-19 (70%) had septic shock which was significantly higher than survived ones. Although the exact pathophysiology of septic shock in these patients is still unclear, it seems to be possible that part of it would be due to the administration of empiric antibiotics with inflammatory properties especially in the absence of bacterial infection. Herein, we have reviewed possible molecular pathways of septic shock in the patients who have received antibiotics with inflammatory properties which mainly is release of interleukin 1\u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor \u03B1 (TNF- \u03B1) through different routes. Altogether, we highly recommend clinicians to look after those antibiotics with anti-inflammatory activity for both empiric antibiotic therapy and reducing the inflammation to prevent septic shock in patients with diagnosed COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh; Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein","journal":"Arch Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa1ce080aa15b5eb4b800cf66eadf2be9adab7f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129207.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440920304094?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340759/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440920304094","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exact pathophysiology of septic shock","possible molecular pathways of septic shock","inflammatory properties","administration of empiric antibiotics","IL","non-survivor patients","diagnosed COVID","TNF- \u03B1","novel coronavirus","Coronavirus diseases","empiric antibiotic therapy","absence of bacterial infection","tumor necrosis factor \u03B1","inflammation","anti-inflammatory activity","endemic emergent situation","World Health Organization","SARS-CoV","different routes","interleukin","survived ones","successful specific treatment","clinicians"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, public awareness and attitudes can help in disaster risk reduction and management efforts toward reducing mortality and economic losses. In Saudi Arabia, many cities have been recently experiencing incidences of disasters, such as floods, disease epidemics, and sandstorms. However, studies on public perception of disaster risk in the country are few and nascent. Therefore, based on a questionnaire survey (n = 683), this paper explores public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in Dammam, a coastal metropolis in Saudi Arabia. The findings indicate that although almost two-thirds (64.7%) of the participants are aware of disasters, and 81% are concerned about disaster risks, less than half (47.3%) believe that their settlements could be at risk. While 37% opine that disasters are caused by both natural factors and human activities, about half (54%) indicate that they can personally contribute to reducing disaster risks. Chi-square analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between place of residence and perception of disaster risks (\u03C72 (6) = 56.18, p \u003C 0.05), and between place of residence and concern about disaster risks (\u03C72 (12) = 68.47, p \u003C 0.05). The paper recommends raising public awareness and encouraging positive behaviors in reducing disaster risks in the study area and similar environments.","publish_time":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"AlQahtany, Ali M.; Abubakar, Ismaila Rimi","journal":"Int J Disaster Risk Reduct","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56ec24b06770347bc7dd532eb66c65f0cddc6f62.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0940850a8a05119c02b4d7d59affacf3b37264a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104059.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420919306193; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420919306193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289014/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101422","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["perception of disaster risks","Disaster risk reduction","public perception of disaster risk","public awareness","incidences of disasters","aware of disasters","attitudes","place of residence","economic losses","paper","\u03C72","Saudi Arabia","half","positive behaviors","human activities","global human","significant positive relationship","management efforts","Dammam","important policy issue","coastal metropolis","floods","mortality","study area","concern","natural factors","developing countries","Chi-square analysis","country","studies","disease epidemics","similar environments","sandstorms","cities","questionnaire survey","participants","settlements","findings","thirds"],"language":"en"},

Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene products are produced following HIV-1 infection to limit viral replication, but viral proteins and RNAs counteract their effect. One such mechanism is specifically directed against the IFN-induced Protein Kinase PKR, which is centrally important to the cellular antiviral response. In the presence of viral RNAs, PKR is activated and phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03B1. This shuts down the synthesis of both host and viral proteins, allowing the cell to mount an effective antiviral response. PACT (protein activator of PKR) is a cellular protein activator of PKR, primarily functioning to activate PKR in response to cellular stress. Recent studies have indicated that during HIV-1 infection, PACT\u0027s normal cellular function is compromised and that PACT is unable to activate PKR. Using various reporter systems and in vitro kinase assays, we establish in this report that interactions between PACT, ADAR1 and HIV-1-encoded Tat protein diminish the activation of PKR in response to HIV-1 infection. Our results highlight an important pathway by which HIV-1 transcripts subvert the host cell\u0027s antiviral activities to enhance their translation.","publish_time":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chukwurah, Evelyn; Handy, Indhira; Patel, Rekha C.","journal":"Biochem J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d359875ce36c09a5832bce1d508798496a5eae3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5363390.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28167698/; https://doi.org/10.1042/bcj20160964","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular antiviral response","cellular protein activator of PKR","activation of PKR","following HIV","effective antiviral response","IFN-induced Protein Kinase PKR","host cell\u0027s innate antiviral response","viral proteins","host cell\u0027s antiviral activities","viral replication","course of infection","cellular stress","presence of viral RNAs","encoded Tat protein","PACT\u0027s normal cellular function","kinase assays","various measures","important pathway","various reporter systems","translation initiation factor eIF2\u03B1","transcripts","stimulated gene products","ADAR1","Human immunodeficiency virus type","interactions","Interferon","synthesis","results","Recent studies","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

At the moment no reports are available regarding thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts. We present the case of a patient with COVID19-related pneumonia, who suffered from the acute thrombosis of a previously implanted aortic graft. CASE REPORT: A 67-year old male patient, undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a bifurcated graft six years before, was admitted to the Emergency Department with high fever for a week without cough or dyspnea. Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Due to the progressive impairment of respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission. The day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography (CT) scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died upon the arrival in radiological suite. CONCLUSION: Acute thrombosis of vascular prosthetic grafts is a possible, catastrophic complication of COVID19 infection. In COVID19 patients with prosthetic graft an aggressive antithrombotic treatment could be considered to prevent such an event.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giacomelli, Elena; Dorigo, Walter; Fargion, Aaron; Calugi, Gianmarco; Cianchi, Giovanni; Pratesi, Carlo","journal":"Ann Vasc Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bed1063c2d6bafb37ecffd32859c064fe4e2798.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188652.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360432/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890509620303666; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2020.04.040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890509620303666?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Acute thrombosis of vascular prosthetic grafts","thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts","implanted aortic graft","COVID19-related pneumonia","complete thrombosis","bifurcated graft","COVID19 patients","catastrophic complication of COVID19 infection","signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia","signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia","year old male patient","abdominal aortic aneurysm","Thoracic ultrasound","duplex ultrasound","revascularization purpose","CASE REPORT","aggressive antithrombotic treatment","prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment","open repair","Antiretroviral therapy","week","high fever","scan","Sars-Cov","urgent angio-computed tomography","flow","increased risk of thrombotic complications","hypercoagulability state","cough","reports","CONCLUSION","progressive impairment of respiratory function","Emergency Department","femoral level","swab","inflammation","arrival","moment","years","radiological suite","dyspnea","days","admission","event"],"language":"en"},

Five (near) complete RVA genomes were obtained. A single RVA strain showed a partial relationship with the Kenyan bat RVA strain, whereas the other strains were completely novel. Only the VP7 and VP4 genes showed significant variability, indicating the occurrence of frequent reassortment events. Comparing these bat RVA strains with currently used human RVA screening primers indicated that most of the novel VP7 and VP4 segments would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies. Therefore, novel consensus screening primers were developed and used to screen samples from infants with gastroenteritis living in close proximity with the studied bat population. Although RVA infections were identified in 36% of the infants, there was no evidence of zoonosis.

Most of the knowledge about the pathogenesis of MS has been derived from murine models, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and viral encephalomyelitis. Here, we infected female C57BL/6 mice with a neurotropic strain of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-59A) to evaluate whether treatment with the multifunctional antioxidant tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) affects the ensuing encephalomyelitis. In untreated animals, neurological symptoms developed quickly: 90% of infected mice died 10 days after virus inoculation and the few survivors presented neurological deficits. Treatment with tempol (24 mg/kg, ip, two doses on the first day and daily doses for 7 days plus 2 mM tempol in the drinking water ad libitum) profoundly altered the disease outcome: neurological symptoms were attenuated, mouse survival increased up to 70%, and half of the survivors behaved as normal mice. Not surprisingly, tempol substantially preserved the integrity of the CNS, including the blood\u2013brain barrier. Furthermore, treatment with tempol decreased CNS viral titers, macrophage and T lymphocyte infiltration, and levels of markers of inflammation, such as expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, transcription of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 and interferon-\u03B3, and protein nitration. The results indicate that tempol ameliorates murine viral encephalomyelitis by altering the redox status of the infectious environment that contributes to an attenuated CNS inflammatory response. Overall, our study supports the development of therapeutic strategies based on nitroxides to manage neuroinflammatory diseases, including MS.","publish_time":"2010-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsuhako, Maria Heloisa; Augusto, Ohara; Linares, Edlaine; Chadi, Gerson; Giorgio, Selma; Pereira, Carlos A.","journal":"Free Radical Biology and Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40bcf4faf38ac363d4f0a5e22a290976b18af0f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126783.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891584909007849; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.12.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584909007849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20035861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["murine viral encephalomyelitis","treatment","CNS viral titers","multifunctional antioxidant tempol","neurological symptoms","ensuing encephalomyelitis","infected mice","attenuated CNS inflammatory response","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","days","survivors","normal mice","neurological deficits","mouse hepatitis virus","demyelinating disease","disease outcome","virus inoculation","murine models","pathogenesis of MS","mouse survival","daily doses","transcription of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","macrophage","expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase","T lymphocyte infiltration","interferon-\u03B3","human central nervous system","neurotropic strain","redox status","nitroxides","levels of markers","drinking water ad libitum","infectious environment","development of therapeutic strategies","inflammation","Abstract Multiple sclerosis","study","protein nitration","piperidinyloxy","blood","MHV","untreated animals","results","neuroinflammatory diseases","brain barrier","female C57BL","tetramethyl","knowledge","half","integrity"],"language":"en"},

The relative ease of siRNA design and the versatility of RNAi to target a broad spectrum of mRNAs have led to the promise that drug discovery in the RNAi pathway could be effective against pathogens. This review discusses the current experimental principles that guide the application of RNAi against HIV and describes challenges and limitations that need to be surmounted in order for siRNAs to become practical antiviral drugs. The practical use of RNAi therapy for HIV infection will depend on overcoming several challenges, including the ability to establish long-term expression of siRNA without off-target effects and the capacity to counteract mutant escape viruses.","publish_time":"2012-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bennasser, Yamina; Yeung, Man Lung; Jeang, Kuan-Teh","journal":"BioDrugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cc3ddc7527cec64a2227aa6d396235d19e931aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100089.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNAi pathway","versatility of RNAi","application of RNAi","practical use of RNAi therapy","HIV infection","target effects","synthetic siRNAs","challenges","small RNA duplexes","specific degradation of complementary target mRNAs","eukaryotic cells","cultured cells","small interfering RNAs","conserved RNA interference","long-term expression of siRNA","broad spectrum of mRNAs","practical antiviral drugs","mutant escape viruses","relative ease of siRNA design","capacity","base","current experimental principles","ability","promise","drug discovery","review","replication","order","recognition","pathogens","studies","limitations"],"language":"en"},

The dramatic budgetary discrepancies in Western nations between the massive funds devoted to medical care and the minuscule sums allotted to public health are often taken as evidence that in such matters, political leaders are irrational (or perhaps uninformed, or captured by big-moneyed medical interests) and that good public policy would have epidemiologists and other public health experts running, or at least orchestrating, the show.

The implications of dysregulation of -1 PRF on human health are examined, as are possible new areas in which novel -1 PRF promoting elements might be discovered.","publish_time":"2015-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Advani, Vivek M.; Dinman, Jonathan D.","journal":"BioEssays","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58a1ecbfbc251ba63590523a0dc75adaac3ea3fe.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bdc916dfb5fd6df34243d3a6e0d9d3dca9de0c92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4749135.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201500131; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4749135?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26661048/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRF","ribosomal slippage","ribosomal frameshifting","possible new areas","critical property of ribosomes","coding sequences of mRNAs","number of genetic elements","novel","adenosines","frame maintenance","gene expression","eukaryotes","human health","implications of dysregulation","study","effects","class","base","recent studies","direction"],"language":"en"},

In particular, MERS continues to pose a significant threat in the Middle East since 2012. Currently, no licensed vaccine or drug treatment is available to treat patients infected with either coronavirus. However, there are some MERS vaccines in the preclinical stage of development. We sought to evaluate the potential impact of targeted vaccination strategies for mitigating SARS and MERS outbreaks in healthcare settings using simple mathematical models and detailed historic transmission trees describing the progression of past nosocomial outbreaks of SARS and MERS. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that vaccination strategies targeting patients and healthcare workers, which have been disproportionately affected during past outbreaks, and assuming two vaccination coverage levels at 50 and 75% have the potential to avert nearly 50% or more of MERS or SARS cases. CONCLUSION: Our modeling results informed by historic outbreak data for SARS and MERS suggest that vaccination strategies targeting patients could be an effective measure to mitigate and prevent outbreaks in the healthcare setting.

However, the time trends for Th1 and Th2 immune responses during these phenomena have not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To identify possible mechanisms underlying the link between respiratory viral infections and asthma exacerbations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 40 adults aged 21\u201358 years for 4 groups. A. Healthy, B. Healthy with viral infection, C. Mild to moderate asthma and D. Same as C, but with viral infection. Th1 and Th2 cytokines in induced sputum samples during the course of acute upper respiratory viral infections in otherwise healthy and asthmatic subjects were monitored. IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-\u03B3 were assayed by ELISA. Viral infection symptoms and asthma severity scores were monitored. Time trends were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: IL-4 and IL-5 levels in groups C and D were higher than in groups A and B. IFN-\u03B3 levels and viral infection symptoms scores in group B spiked by day 2 and rapidly declined by day 7, while in group D, IFN-\u03B3 and symptoms scores for viral infection and asthma peaked much later (days 3\u20135) and slowly declined.

Since July 2014, an unexpected large dengue outbreak has occurred in Guangdong province, China, resulting in more than 40000 patients including six deaths. To clarify and characterize the causative agent of this outbreak, the acute phase serum from a patient diagnosed with severe dengue was subjected to virus isolation and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Traditional real-time RT-PCR and HTS with Ion Torrent PGM detected the presence of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). A clinical DENV-2 isolate GZ05/2014 was obtained by culturing the patient serum in mosquito C6/36 cells. The complete genome of GZ05/2014 was determined and deposited in GenBank under the access number KP012546. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete envelope gene showed that the newly DENV-2 isolate belonged to Cosmopolitan genotype and clustered closely with other Guangdong strains isolated in the past decade. No amino acid mutations that are obviously known to increase virulence or replication were identified throughout the genome of GZ05/2014. The high homology of Guangdong DENV-2 strains indicated the possibility of establishment of local DENV-2 circulation in Guangdong, China. These results help clarify the origin of this epidemic and predict the future status of dengue in China.

In this study, we obtained the full-length genomes of HCoV-OC43 strains from two previously unrecognized lineages identified among patients presenting with severe upper respiratory tract symptoms in a cross-sectional molecular surveillance study in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between 2012 and 2013. Phylogenetic, recombination and comparative genomic analyses revealed two distinct clusters diverging from a genotype D-like common ancestor through recombination with a putative genotype A-like lineage in the non-structural protein (nsp) 10 gene. Signature amino acid substitutions and a glycine residue insertion at the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit of the spike gene, among others, exhibited further distinction in a recombination pattern, to which these clusters were classified as genotypes F and G. The phylogeographic mapping of the global spike gene indicated that the genetically similar HCoV-OC43 genotypes F and G strains were potentially circulating in China, Japan, Thailand and Europe as early as the late 2000s. The transmission network construction based on the TN93 pairwise genetic distance revealed the emergence and persistence of multiple sub-epidemic clusters of the highly prevalent genotype D and its descendant genotypes F and G, which contributed to the spread of HCoV-OC43 in the region. Finally, a more consistent nomenclature system for non-recombinant and recombinant HCoV-OC43 lineages is proposed, taking into account genetic recombination as an important feature in HCoV evolution and classification.","publish_time":"2017-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oong, Xiang Yong; Ng, Kim Tien; Takebe, Yutaka; Ng, Liang Jie; Chan, Kok Gan; Chook, Jack Bee; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Tee, Kok Keng","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/741d9ac96e2951be86d4f57d5dac2121953fe3bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5285497.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28050020/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["G.

However, such studies pose unique challenges for field specimen collection, including as we have observed the appearance of mould in some nasal swab specimens. We therefore investigated the impact of sample collection quality and the presence of visible mould in samples upon respiratory virus detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. METHODS: Anterior nasal swab samples were collected from infants participating in an ongoing community-based, longitudinal, dynamic birth cohort study. The samples were first collected from each infant shortly after birth and weekly thereafter. They were then mailed to the laboratory where they were catalogued, stored at -80\u00B0C and later screened by PCR for 17 respiratory viruses. The quality of specimen collection was assessed by screening for human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using endogenous retrovirus 3 (ERV3). The impact of ERV3 load upon respiratory virus detection and the impact of visible mould observed in a subset of swabs reaching the laboratory upon both ERV3 loads and respiratory virus detection was determined. RESULTS: In total, 4933 nasal swabs were received in the laboratory. ERV3 load in nasal swabs was associated with respiratory virus detection. Reduced respiratory virus detection (odds ratio 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.44) was observed in samples where the ERV3 could not be identified. Mould was associated with increased time of samples reaching the laboratory and reduced ERV3 loads and respiratory virus detection. CONCLUSION: Suboptimal sample collection and high levels of visible mould can impact negatively upon sample quality. Quality control measures, including monitoring human DNA loads using ERV3 as a marker for epithelial cell components in samples should be undertaken to optimize the validity of real-time PCR results for respiratory virus investigations in community-based studies.","publish_time":"2014-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alsaleh, Asma N; Whiley, David M; Bialasiewicz, Seweryn; Lambert, Stephen B; Ware, Robert S; Nissen, Michael D; Sloots, Theo P; Grimwood, Keith","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da412bad3772b82d1b3ab2d1aa1e00035869ac55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3897990.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory virus detection","respiratory virus investigations","reduced ERV3","impact of ERV3 load","timing of respiratory viruses","impact of visible mould","laboratory","impact of sample collection quality","nasal swabs","sample quality","quality of specimen collection","Anterior nasal swab samples","presence of visible mould","appearance of mould","community-based studies","Suboptimal sample collection","increased time of samples","high levels of visible mould","longitudinal studies","field specimen collection","nasal swab specimens","validity of real-time PCR results","monitoring human DNA loads","Quality control measures","subset of swabs","ongoing community","human deoxyribonucleic acid","real-time polymerase chain reaction","dynamic birth cohort study","marker","screening","odds ratio","unique challenges","infants","epithelial cell components","endogenous retrovirus","assays","CONCLUSION","infections","METHODS","nature","population","total","confidence interval","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The conservation of the N-terminal region in two apparently unrelated proteins of two different RNA virus families suggested that this helix might represent an independent module. To test this hypothesis, we constructed chimeric poliovirus (PV) genomes in which the sequence encoding the N-terminal 2C amphipathic helix was replaced by orthologous sequences from other picornaviral genomes or a similar sequence from NS5A of HCV. Effects of the mutations were assessed by measuring the accumulation of viable virus and viral RNA in HeLa cells after transfection, examining membrane morphology in cells expressing chimeric proteins and by in vitro analysis of RNA translation, protein processing and negative strand RNA synthesis in HeLa cell extracts. The chimeras manifested a wide range of growth and RNA synthesis phenotypes.

Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional meteorological stations. In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion days since regional onset in each state. The results showed a negative association between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC and LTR variables. The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR. The associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically significant. The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95 \u00B0C and mean precipitation around 8.74 mm) delayed the regional onset. However, the regional onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and higher precipitations (20.57 \u00B0C and 20.87 mm respectively) than the observed in the tropical climate. The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65 \u00B0C and 8.48 mm respectively). Meteorological factors influenced the trend on the regional outbreaks in Mexican\u0027s states likely by the host predisposition and susceptibility during the cold winter season. In Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoac\u00E1n, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos etc.).","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00E9ndez-Arriaga, Fabiola","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd7451890932d6733c09ae3be36c1d2285e01a71.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720330771?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720330771; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139560","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LCPC","LTR"],"locations":["Mexico","Durango","Zacatecas"],"keyphrases":["regional LCPC","regional climate effects","tropical climate","regional outbreaks","climate classification","climate characteristics","regional meteorological stations","fastest regional onsets","mean temperature","mean precipitation","local infection","LTR variables","national onset","daily local COVID","local transmission ratio","tempered climates","Mexican\u0027s states","lowest temperatures","lowest precipitations","dry climates","tropical areas","local transmission of coronavirus SARS-CoV","daily weather","tempered regions","lower temperatures","negative association","higher precipitations","Meteorological factors","capital of Mexico","incidence of infectious diseases","epidemics","confirmed positive cases","evaporation","environmental conditions","host predisposition","effective contagion days","susceptibility","research","consequence","trend","number","crucial role","max","close relationship","cold winter season","Chihuahua","Michoac\u00E1n","Jalisco","Colima","Campeche","Zacatecas","phase","Puebla","Durango","results","work","associations","Morelos","Statistical analysis"],"language":"en"},

Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia. The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive.

The RUB genomic RNA is 9757 nucleotides in length [excluding the poly(A) tail] and has a G/C content of 69.5%, the highest of any RNA virus sequenced to date. The RUB genomic RNA contains two long open reading frames (ORFs), a 5\u2032-proximal ORF of 6656 nucleotides and a 3\u2032-proximal ORF of 3189 nucleotides which encodes the structural proteins. Thus, the genomic organization of RUB is similar to that of alphaviruses, the other genus of the Togavirus family, and the 5\u2032-proximal ORF of RUB therefore putatively codes for the nonstructural proteins. Sequences homologous to three regions of nucleotide sequence highly conserved among alphaviruses (a stem-and-loop structure at the 5\u2032 end of the genome, a 51-nucleotide conserved sequence near the 5\u2032 end of the genome, and a 20-nucleotide conserved sequence at the subgenomic RNA start site) were found in the RUB genomic RNA. Amino acid sequence comparisons between the nonstructural ORF of RUB and alphaviruses revealed only one short (122 amino acids) region of significant homology, indicating that these viruses are only distantly related. This region of homology is located at the NH2 terminus of nsP3 in the alphavirus genome. The RUB nonstructural protein ORF contains two global amino acid motifs conserved in a large number of positive-polarity RNA viruses, a motif indicative of helicase activity and a motif indicative of replicase activity. The order of the helicase motif and the nsP3 homology region in the RUB genome is reversed with respect to the alphavirus genome indicating that a genetic rearrangement has occurred during the evolution of these viruses.","publish_time":"1990-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dominguez, Geraldina; Wang, Chin-Yen; Frey, Teryl K.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682290904768; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682290904768","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RUB genomic RNA","RUB genome","nonstructural ORF of RUB","proximal ORF of RUB","genomic organization of RUB","RUB nonstructural protein ORF","nucleotide conserved sequence","subgenomic RNA","polarity RNA viruses","alphavirus genome","regions of nucleotide sequence","region of homology","nucleotides","alphaviruses","Amino acid sequence comparisons","nsP3 homology region","helicase motif","nonstructural proteins","region of significant homology","motif indicative of helicase activity","amino acids","motif indicative of replicase activity","end","global amino acid motifs","rubella virus","NH2 terminus of nsP3","large number of positive","open reading frames","codes","genetic rearrangement","stem","length","site","respect","Sequences homologous","ORFs","loop structure","genus","poly","evolution","C content","Togavirus family","tail","order","date"],"language":"en"},

As such, prolonged glial activation, as is thought to occur during a persistent viral infection of the CNS, may contribute to both neurodegeneration and demyelination. However, the effects of virus-induced glial activation on oligodendrocytes are not fully understood. METHOD: To determine the effects of glial activation on oligodendrocyte viability we treated primary glial cultures isolated from neonatal rats or mice with the RNA viral mimic poly(I:C) and in some cases other TLR ligands. TLR3 expression was determined by western blot. Cytokine levels were measured by RT-PCR, ELISA, and intracellular cytokine staining. Oligodendrocyte precursor (preOL) viability was determined by Alamar blue assays and immunocytochemistry. RESULT: Stimulation of mixed glial cultures with poly(I:C) resulted in microglia activation, TNF\u03B1 production and preOL toxicity. This toxic effect of poly(I:C) was indirect as it failed to affect preOL viability in pure cultures despite the fact that preOLs express TLR3. Poly(I:C)-induced loss of preOLs was abolished in TNF\u03B1 or TNFR1 deficient mixed glial cultures, suggesting that TNF\u03B1/TNFR1 signaling is required for poly(I:C) toxicity. Furthermore, although both microglia and astrocytes express functional TLR3, only microglia produced TNF\u03B1 in culture. Consistent with these findings, other TLR agonists similarly triggered TNF\u03B1 production and preOL toxicity in mixed glial cultures. CONCLUSION: Activation of microglia by poly(I:C) promotes TNF\u03B1/TNFR1-dependent oligodendroglial cell death. These data indicate that during an ongoing viral infection of the CNS, microglial TNF\u03B1 may be detrimental to oligodendrocytes.","publish_time":"2011-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steelman, Andrew J; Li, Jianrong","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7417991beaa7bd0483f9dbdd549c12eeee26508.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3162898.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-8-89; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21812954/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Poly"],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of glial activation","Activation of glial cells","prolonged glial activation","microglia activation","Activation of microglia","primary glial cultures","microglial TNF\u03B1","Stimulation of mixed glial cultures","TNFR1 deficient mixed glial cultures","triggered TNF\u03B1 production","preOL viability","preOL toxicity","pure cultures","toxic effect of poly","RNA viral mimic poly","oligodendrocyte viability","preOLs express TLR3","CNS","ongoing viral infection","persistent viral infection","functional TLR3","TLR3 expression","oligodendrocytes","intracellular cytokine staining","induced loss of preOLs","intracellular pathogen recognition receptors","TLR agonists","Oligodendrocyte precursor","effects of virus","TLR ligands","Cytokine levels","TNFR1-dependent oligodendroglial cell death","toxic acute phase reactants","release","mice","neonatal rats","fact","nitric oxide","ELISA","TLRs","toll","RT-PCR","Alamar blue assays","findings","astrocytes","RESULT","extracellular space","immunocytochemistry","western blot","cases","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","neurodegeneration","data","demyelination","METHOD"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55\u00B75 years (SD 13\u00B71), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

This exact computation meant that multiple-comparisons corrected P values also had high precision, which is crucial when performing millions or billions of tests in large databases. Here, we introduce an improvement to the algorithmic complexity of this computation from O(mn(3)) to O(mn(2)), where m and n are the numbers of recombination-informative sites in the candidate recombinant. This new computation allows for recombination analysis to be performed in alignments with thousands of polymorphic sites.

We report that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, which activates the small GTPase Arf1 to induce COPI transport processes, is required for rotavirus replication since knocking down GBF1 expression by RNA interference, or inhibiting its activity by treatment with Brefeldin A (BFA) or Golgicide A (GCA) significantly reduce the yield of infectious viral progeny. This reduction in virus yield was related to a block in virus assembly since in the presence of either BFA or GCA the assembly of infectious mature triple-layered virions was significantly prevented and only doubled layered-particles were detected. We report that the catalytic activity of GBF1, but not the activation of Arf1, is essential for the assembly of the outer capsid of rotavirus. We show that both BFA and GCA, as well as interfering with the synthesis of GBF1, alter the electrophoretic mobility of glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4 and block the trimerization of the virus surface VP7, a step required for its incorporation into virus particles. Although a post-translational modification of VP7 (other than glycosylation) could be related to the lack of trimerization, we found that NSP4 might also be involved in this process, since knocking-down its expression reduces VP7 trimerizarion. In support, recombinant VP7 protein overexpressed in transfected cells formed trimers only when co-transfected with NSP4. Rotavirus, a member of the family Reoviridae, is the major cause of severe diarrhea in children and young animals worldwide. Despite the significant advances in the characterization of the biology of this virus, the mechanisms involved in morphogenesis of the virus particle are still poorly understood. In this work, we show that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, relevant for the COPI/Arf1-mediated cellular vesicular transport, participates in the replication cycle of the virus, influencing the correct processing of viral glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4, and the assembly of the virus surface proteins VP7 and VP4.","publish_time":"2019-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez, Jos\u00E9 L.; Arnoldi, Francesca; Schraner, Elisabeth M.; Eichwald, Catherine; Silva-Ayala, Daniela; Lee, Eunjoo; Sztul, Elizabeth; Burrone, \u00D3scar R.; L\u00F3pez, Susana; Arias, Carlos F.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6148628ee6c8f367aa9f7f6e38af1c1c19c13791.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d10525ee12ac8eb0941e0b21d04b3552baaeb79d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/619924","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPI","Brefeldin","GCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus assembly","virus surface VP7","virus yield","virus particles","virus surface proteins VP7","VP7 trimerizarion","NSP4","GBF1 expression","rotavirus replication","recombinant VP7 protein","synthesis of GBF1","GCA","replication cycle of rotavirus","BFA","correct processing of viral glycoproteins VP7","electrophoretic mobility of glycoproteins VP7","catalytic activity of GBF1","guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1","post-translational modification of VP7","activation of Arf1","yield of infectious viral progeny","viral factors","outer capsid of rotavirus","layered-particles","block","assembly of infectious mature triple-layered virions","COPI transport processes","small GTPase Arf1","cellular vesicular transport","transfected cells","lack of trimerization","children","major cause of severe diarrhea","trimers","step","family Reoviridae","young animals","Brefeldin","characterization","biology","RNA interference","morphogenesis","mechanisms","VP4","presence","member","treatment","support","Golgicide","incorporation","interfering","significant advances","glycosylation","reduction","work"],"language":"en"},

The incidence of asthma has increased dramatically during this time period, with the highest increases in the urban areas of developed countries. It seems that the incidence in developing countries may follow this trend as well. While our knowledge of the pathophysiology of asthma and the available of newer, safer medication have both improved, the mortality of the disease has undergone an overall increase in the past 30 years. Asthma treatment goals in children include decreasing mortality and improving quality of life. Specific treatment goals include but are not limited to decreasing inflammation, improving lung function, decreasing clinical symptoms, reducing hospital stays and emergency department visits, reducing work or school absences, and reducing the need for rescue medications. Non-pharmacological management strategies include allergen avoidance, environmental evaluation for allergens and irritants, patient education, allergy testing, regular monitoring of lung function, and the use of asthma management plans, asthma control tests, peak flow meters, and asthma diaries. Achieving asthma treatment goals reduces direct and indirect costs of asthma and is economically cost-effective. Treatment in children presents unique challenges in diagnosis and management.

METHODS: We discuss the types of graphical display commonly encountered in primary diagnostic accuracy studies and systematic reviews of such studies, and systematically review the use of graphical displays in recent diagnostic primary studies and systematic reviews. RESULTS: We identified 57 primary studies and 49 systematic reviews. Fifty-six percent of primary studies and 53% of systematic reviews used graphical displays to present results. Dot-plot or box-and- whisker plots were the most commonly used graph in primary studies and were included in 22 (39%) studies. ROC plots were the most common type of plot included in systematic reviews and were included in 22 (45%) reviews. One primary study and five systematic reviews included a probability-modifying plot. CONCLUSION: Graphical displays are currently underused in primary diagnostic accuracy studies and systematic reviews of such studies. Diagnostic accuracy studies need to include multiple types of graphic in order to provide both a detailed overview of the results (diagnostic accuracy) and to communicate information that can be used to inform clinical practice (predictive value).

We examined the role of aerosol transmission of influenza in an acute ward setting. Methods. We investigated a seasonal influenza A outbreak that occurred in our general medical ward (with open bay ward layout) in 2008. Clinical and epidemiological information was collected in real time during the outbreak. Spatiotemporal analysis was performed to estimate the infection risk among patients. Airflow measurements were conducted, and concentrations of hypothetical virus-laden aerosols at different ward locations were estimated using computational fluid dynamics modeling. Results. Nine inpatients were infected with an identical strain of influenza A/H3N2 virus. With reference to the index patient\u0027s location, the attack rate was 20.0% and 22.2% in the \u201Csame\u201D and \u201Cadjacent\u201D bays, respectively, but 0% in the \u201Cdistant\u201D bay (P=.04). Temporally, the risk of being infected was highest on the day when noninvasive ventilation was used in the index patient; multivariate logistic regression revealed an odds ratio of 14.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.7\u2013131.3; P=.015). A simultaneous, directional indoor airflow blown from the \u201Csame\u201D bay toward the \u201Cadjacent\u201D bay was found; it was inadvertently created by an unopposed air jet from a separate air purifier placed next to the index patient\u0027s bed. Computational fluid dynamics modeling revealed that the dispersal pattern of aerosols originated from the index patient coincided with the bed locations of affected patients. Conclusions. Our findings suggest a possible role of aerosol transmission of influenza in an acute ward setting. Source and engineering controls, such as avoiding aerosol generation and improving ventilation design, may warrant consideration to prevent nosocomial outbreaks.","publish_time":"2010-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Bonnie C.

Multivariable logistic regression and ROC curve analysis were performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. Results: A total of 101 patients were included in this study; diseases progression occurred in 17 patients, 84 patients improved, 6 were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU), and 5 died.

Infection by the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus caused severe lower airway inflammation and pneumonia. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that affects the entire brachial tree, and was one of the commonest underlying medical conditions among patients hospitalized with the 2009 pandemic influenza virus infection. Although respiratory virus infections are the major causes of asthma exacerbation, the mechanism by which influenza exacerbates asthma is poorly understood. Animal models of disease comorbidity are crucial to understanding host-pathogen interactions and elucidating complex pathologies. Existing murine models of influenza virus infection in asthmatics show that asthmatic mice are highly resistant to influenza virus infection, which contradicts clinical observations in humans. Here, we developed a murine model of influenza virus/asthma comorbidity using NC/Nga mice, which are highly sensitive to allergic reactions such as atopic dermatitis and allergic airway inflammation. This model was then used to examine the impact of allergic airway inflammation on lung pathology in the 2009 pandemic influenza virus infected mice. The results showed that induction of acute allergic airway inflammation in pre-existing influenza virus infection had additive effects on exacerbation of lung pathology, which mirrors findings in human epidemiological studies. In contrast, pre-existing allergic airway inflammation protected from subsequent influenza virus infection, which was compatible with those of previous murine models of influenza virus infection in asthmatic mice. These variable outcomes of this murine model indicate that the temporal relation between allergic airway inflammation and influenza virus infection might play a critical role in asthma and influenza comorbidity. Thus, this murine model will further our understanding of how influenza virus infection affects an asthmatic host and may aid the development of strategies to improve treatments and outcomes for asthmatics harboring influenza virus infection.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kawaguchi, Akira; Suzuki, Tadaki; Ohara, Yuki; Takahashi, Kenta; Sato, Yuko; Ainai, Akira; Nagata, Noriyo; Tashiro, Masato; Hasegawa, Hideki","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2264a7f6a968665b70a4a06c73e096e0710fc3f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5330494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28245238/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NC/Nga"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza virus infection","pre-existing influenza virus infection","subsequent influenza virus infection","murine model of influenza virus","influenza comorbidity","previous murine models of influenza virus infection","Existing murine models of influenza virus infection","pandemic influenza virus infected mice","respiratory virus infections","pre-existing allergic airway inflammation","impact of allergic airway inflammation","induction of acute allergic airway inflammation","asthma comorbidity","severe lower airway inflammation","allergic reactions","asthmatic mice","asthmatic host","Nga mice","major causes of asthma exacerbation","exacerbation of lung pathology","Animal models of disease comorbidity","asthmatics","understanding","host-pathogen interactions","respiratory pathogen responsible","variable outcomes","additive effects","atopic dermatitis","airways","temporal relation","critical role","patients","H1N1","NC","findings","treatments","mechanism","clinical observations","commonest underlying medical conditions","chronic inflammatory disorder","pneumonia","contrast","complex pathologies","development of strategies","human epidemiological studies","entire brachial tree","results","humans"],"language":"en"},

Their functions range from nucleic acid duplex unwinding to protein displacement and double-strand translocation. This explains their participation in virtually every metabolic process that involves nucleic acids, including DNA replication, recombination and repair, transcription, translation, as well as RNA processing. Helicases are encoded by all plant and animal viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome that is larger than 7kb, indicating a link to genome size evolution in this virus class. Viral helicases belong to three out of the six currently recognized superfamilies, SF1, SF2, and SF3. Despite being omnipresent, highly conserved and essential, only a few viral helicases, mostly from SF2, have been studied extensively. In general, their specific roles in the viral replication cycle remain poorly understood at present. The SF1 helicase protein of viruses classified in the order Nidovirales is encoded in replicase open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), which is translated to give rise to a large polyprotein following a ribosomal frameshift from the upstream ORF1a. Proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein yields a dozen or so mature proteins, one of which includes a helicase. Its hallmark is the presence of an N-terminal multi-nuclear zinc-binding domain, the nidoviral genetic marker and one of the most conserved domains across members of the order. This review summarizes biochemical, structural, and genetic data, including drug development studies, obtained using helicases originating from several mammalian nidoviruses, along with the results of the genomics characterization of a much larger number of (putative) helicases of vertebrate and invertebrate nidoviruses. In the context of our knowledge of related helicases of cellular and viral origin, it discusses the implications of these results for the protein\u0027s emerging critical function(s) in nidovirus evolution, genome replication and expression, virion biogenesis, and possibly also post-transcriptional processing of viral RNAs. Using our accumulated knowledge and highlighting gaps in our data, concepts and approaches, it concludes with a perspective on future research aimed at elucidating the role of helicases in the nidovirus replication cycle.","publish_time":"2015-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lehmann, Kathleen C.; Snijder, Eric J.; Posthuma, Clara C.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f066adacdbf0610f4a16ce884250d53586d3040.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114383.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25497126/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.12.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214005061; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214005061","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral helicases","role of helicases","Abstract Helicases","helicases of vertebrate","viral replication cycle","genome replication","viral origin","knowledge of related helicases of cellular","nidovirus replication cycle","DNA replication","RNA processing","post-transcriptional processing of viral RNAs","nidovirus evolution","genome size evolution","genetic data","replicase polyprotein","results","SF1 helicase protein of viruses","Proteolytic processing","SF2","positive-sense RNA genome","protein displacement","nucleic acids","animal viruses","large polyprotein","order Nidovirales","larger number","mature proteins","accumulated knowledge","conserved domains","invertebrate nidoviruses","mammalian nidoviruses","nidoviral genetic marker","versatile NTP-dependent motor proteins of monophyletic origin","nucleic acid duplex unwinding","replicase open reading frame","N-terminal multi-nuclear zinc-binding domain","protein\u0027s emerging critical function","recombination","expression","virion biogenesis","ribosomal frameshift","functions range","repair","highlighting gaps","translation","drug development studies","specific roles","double-strand translocation","presence","ORF1b","metabolic process","concepts","genomics characterization","virus class","dozen","plant","implications","perspective","future research","upstream ORF1a","approaches","recognized superfamilies","members","link","context","participation","review","hallmark","rise","SF3","present","kingdoms of life"],"language":"en"},

As in the case of developing fields, ethical approaches are not well developed in the collection, processing, and analysis of participants\u2019 information. Existing controversies and varying national ethical regulations can, thus, hamper efficient cross-border research collaboration to the detriment of quality disease surveillance. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review characterizes current practices on how ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSIs) pertinent to research ethics are handled by different Influenzanet country groups to analyze similarities and identify the need for further harmonization of ethical approaches. METHODS: A literature search was carried out on PubMed, Web of Science, Global Digital Library on Ethics, and Bioethics Literature Database to identify ELSIs for Influenzanet country platforms. Only English-language papers were included with publication dates from 2003 to 2017. Publications were screened for the application of bioethics principles in the implementation of country platforms. Additional publications gathered from the Influenzanet Consortium website, reference screening, and conference proceeding were screened for ELSIs. RESULTS: We gathered 96 papers from our search methodology. In total, 28 papers that mentioned ELSIs were identified and included in this study. The Research Ethics Committee (REC) approvals were sought for recruiting participants and collecting their data in 8 of 11 country platforms and informed e-consent was sought from participants in 9 of 11 country platforms. Furthermore, personal data protection was ensured throughout the Consortium using data anonymization before processing and analysis and using aggregated data. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemics forecasting activities, such as Influenzanet, are beneficial; however, its benefits could be further increased through the harmonization of data gathering and ethical requirements. This objective is achievable by the Consortium. More transparency should be promoted concerning REC-approved research for Influenzanet-like systems. The validity of informed e-consent could also be increased through the provision of a user friendly and standard information sheet across the Consortium where participants agree to its terms, conditions, and privacy policies before being able to fill in the questionnaire. This will help to build trust in the general public while preventing any decline in participation.","publish_time":"2018-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Genevi\u00E8ve, Lester Darryl; Wangmo, Tenzin; Dietrich, Damien; Woolley-Meza, Olivia; Flahault, Antoine; Elger, Bernice Simone","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6231872.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.9616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30305258/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bioethics Literature Database","The Research Ethics Committee"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenzanet country platforms","ELSIs","Influenzanet Consortium website","harmonization of data","implementation of country platforms","different Influenzanet country groups","ethical requirements","harmonization of ethical approaches","data anonymization","aggregated data","Research Ethics Committee","recruiting participants","REC-approved research","help of volunteering participants","personal data protection","processing","varying national ethical regulations","literature search","OBJECTIVE","validity of informed e-consent","Bioethics Literature Database","analysis of participants\u2019 information","English-language papers","efficient cross-border research collaboration","Web of Science","Additional publications","search methodology","standard information sheet","application of bioethics principles","Web-based technologies","Global Digital Library","reference screening","approvals","flu seasons","current practices","social issues","illness","user friendly","Existing controversies","PubMed","terms","similarities","detriment of quality disease surveillance","conference proceeding","scoping review","privacy policies","conditions","case of developing fields","need","general public","European countries","decline","provision","publication dates","Epidemics","activities","systems","trust","participation","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","collection","total","benefits","questionnaire","transparency","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","study"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken among practicing DHPs in Saudi Arabia. A total of 202 DHPs participated in this study. Knowledge and attitude were assessed using self-administered and pretested questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered online through Survey Monkey(\u00AE) program by sending link to the registered E-mail. Descriptive statistics were performed on demographic data. Mean knowledge and mean attitude scores of DHPs were calculated. Mann\u2013Whitney U-test and Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests were used to disclose the differences between study variables. Chi-square tests and Spearman\u0027s correlation tests were applied to find the associations between the variables. RESULTS: The study participants showed mean knowledge score of 12.26 \u00B1 2.27 (based on 17 knowledge questions) and attitude score of 8.63 \u00B1 1.68 (based on 10 attitude questions). The spearman\u0027s test showed the positive correlation between knowledge and attitude of DHPs about MERS (r = 0.093, P = 0.188). Knowledge gaps were reflected in questions related to the duration of infectivity (47.5%), treatment of MERS (39.6%), reservoir of MERS-CoV (38.1%), availability of vaccination against MERS-CoV (25.2%), the likelihood of infection (24.3%), and the type of MERS-CoV (23.3%). DHPs showed a positive attitude toward adherence to universal precautions given by CDC and WHO (0.94 \u00B1 0.25), active participation infection control program (0.94 \u00B1 0.24), and use of gowns, gloves, mask, and goggles while dealing with MERS-CoV patients (0.97 \u00B1 0.17). Male DHPs showed significantly higher knowledge and positive attitude toward MERS-CoV infection compared to females. CONCLUSION: DHPs participated in this study showed good knowledge and positive attitude toward MERS. However, still few lacunae in the knowledge and attitudes toward MERS-CoV were found requiring extensive educational programs.","publish_time":"2018-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Althomairy, Sameer Abdullah; Baseer, Mohammad Abdul; Assery, Mansour; Alsaffan, Abdulrahman Dahham","journal":"J Int Soc Prev Community Dent","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5946522.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/jispcd.jispcd_9_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29780739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["attitude of DHPs","MERS-CoV infection","positive attitude","knowledge questions","MERS-CoV patients","attitude questions","higher knowledge","good knowledge","reservoir of MERS","Knowledge gaps","treatment of MERS","type of MERS","mean attitude scores of DHPs","mean knowledge score","practicing DHPs","Male DHPs","study variables","study participants","positive correlation","cross-sectional descriptive study","Spearman\u0027s correlation tests","Wallis tests","Chi-square tests","spearman\u0027s test","Saudi Arabia","likelihood of infection","active participation infection control program","dental auxiliaries","Descriptive statistics","pretested questionnaire","dental health professionals","Whitney U-test","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","dentist","adherence","Kruskal","universal precautions","METHODS","goggles","attitudes","availability of vaccination","extensive educational programs","gloves","mask","CDC","link","demographic data","Mann","MATERIALS","Survey Monkey","RESULTS","differences","females","registered E-mail","duration of infectivity","gowns","AIM","OBJECTIVE","associations","lacunae","CONCLUSION","total"],"language":"en"},

This problem is particularly severe in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries because of shortages in certain medical disciplines, due to a lack of nationally-trained professionals and a less developed educational system compared to other high income countries. Consequently, GCC countries are heavily dependent on an expatriate health care workforce; a problem exacerbated by high turnover. We discuss challenges and potential strategies for improving and strengthening capacity building efforts in health care professions in the GCC. MAIN TEXT: In the GCC, there are 139 schools providing professional health education in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, midwifery, and other specialties. Health education school density reported for the GCC countries ranges between 2.2 and 2.8 schools per one million inhabitants, except in Oman where it is 4.0 per one million inhabitants. The GCC countries rely heavily on expatriate health professionals. The number of physicians and nurses in the GCC countries are 2.1 and 4.5 per 1000 respectively, compared to 2.8 and 7.9 among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Interestingly, the number of dentists and pharmacists is higher in the GCC countries compared to OECD countries. A nationally trained health care workforce is essential for the GCC countries. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are two identified areas where growth and development are recommended. Custom-tailored continuing medical education and continuing professional development (CPD) programs can augment the skills of health practitioners, and allow for the expansion of their scope of practice when warranted. CONCLUSION: Capacity building can play an essential role in addressing the major health challenges and improving the overall quality of health care in the region. Efforts aimed at increasing the number of locally-trained graduates and developing and implementing need-based CPD programs are vital for capacity building and lifelong learning in health care professions.

At euthanasia (12 dpi), viral RNA and antigen positive cells were detected in lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys of only the B1648 group and in tracheas of both the B1648 and M41 group. In conclusion, only B1648 can easily disseminate to internal organs via a cell-free and -associated viremia with KUL01(\u002B) cells as important carrier cells.","publish_time":"2016-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reddy, Vishwanatha R.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate whether a Web-based intervention can encourage more frequent hand-washing in the home, and to examine potential mediators and moderators of outcomes, as a necessary first step before testing effects of the intervention on infection rates in the PRIMIT trial (PRimary care trial of a website based Infection control intervention to Modify Influenza-like illness and respiratory infection Transmission). METHODS: In a parallel-group pragmatic exploratory trial design, 517 nonblinded adults recruited through primary care were automatically randomly assigned to a fully automated intervention comprising 4 sessions of tailored motivational messages and self-regulation support (n = 324) or to a no-intervention control group (n = 179; ratio 2:1). Hand-washing frequency and theory of planned behavior cognitions relating to hand-washing were assessed by online questionnaires at baseline (in only half of the control participants, to permit evaluation of effects of baseline assessment on effect sizes), at 4 weeks (postintervention; all participants), and at 12 weeks. RESULTS: Hand-washing rates in the intervention group were higher at 4 weeks than in the control group (mean 4.40, n = 285 and mean 4.04, n = 157, respectively; P \u003C .001, Cohen d = 0.42) and remained higher at 12 weeks (mean 4.45, n = 282 and mean 4.12, n = 154, respectively; P \u003C .001, Cohen d = 0.34). Hand-washing intentions and positive attitudes toward hand-washing increased more from baseline to 4 weeks in the intervention group than in the control group. Mediation analyses revealed positive indirect effects of the intervention on change in hand-washing via intentions (coefficient = .15, 95% confidence interval [CI], .08\u2013.26) and attitudes (coefficient = 0.16, 95% CI, .09\u2013.26). Moderator analyses confirmed that the intervention was similarly effective for men and women, those of higher and lower socioeconomic status, and those with higher and lower levels of perceived risk. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides promising evidence that Web-based interventions could potentially provide an effective method of promoting hand hygiene in the home. Data were collected during the 2010 influenza pandemic, when participants in both groups had already been exposed to extensive publicity about the need for hand hygiene, suggesting that our intervention could add to existing public health campaigns. However, further research is required to determine the effects of the intervention on actual infection rates.

Recent structural studies reveal a complex set of interactions between the ribosome and its ligands, mRNA and tRNA, that indicate ways in which the ribosome could avoid costly translational errors. Ribosomes must decode each successive codon accurately, and structural data provide a clear indication of how ribosomes limit recruitment of the wrong tRNA (sense errors). In a triplet-based genetic code there are three potential forward reading frames, only one of which encodes the correct protein. Errors in which the ribosome reads a codon out of the normal reading frame (frameshift errors) occur less frequently than sense errors, although it is not clear from structural data how these errors are avoided. Some mRNA sequences, termed programmed-frameshift sites, cause the ribosome to change reading frame. Based on recent work on these sites, this article proposes that the ribosome uses the structure of the codon\u2013anticodon complex formed by the peptidyl-tRNA, especially its wobble interaction, to constrain the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA to the correct reading frame.","publish_time":"2002-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stahl, Guillaume; McCarty, Gregory P; Farabaugh, Philip J","journal":"Trends in Biochemical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3efeba9029aeb71ef2c9ca017f97c131aabee648.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126812.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968000402020649; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000402020649","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frameshift errors","sense errors","correct reading frame","normal reading frame","costly translational errors","wrong tRNA","peptidyl-tRNA","structural data","incoming aminoacyl-tRNA","successive codon","Recent structural studies","correct protein","potential forward reading frames","programmed-frameshift sites","clear indication","anticodon complex","genetic information","genetic code","mRNA sequences","recent work","complex set of interactions","ribosomes limit recruitment","form of RNA","wobble interaction","molecular machine","structure","ligands","article","ways","triplet"],"language":"en"},

Here, PM2.5 was monitored and collected in central China, and its cytotoxicity mechanism on human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) was investigated. With the average concentration of 109 \u00B1 69 \u03BCg/m3, PM2.5 was rich in heavy metals and organic pollutants. After exposure to PM2.5, the viability of BEAS-2B cells decreased, where 510 dysregulated genes were predicted to induce necroptosis via inhibiting ATP synthesis through the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway. Cellular experiments demonstrated that the content of ATP was downregulated, while the expression of RIP3, a necroptosis indicator, was upregulated. Besides, four enzymes in charge of ATP synthesis were downregulated, including ATP5F, NDUF, COX7A, and UQCR, while two genes of RELA and CAPN1 responsible for necroptosis were upregulated. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine was applied as an enhancer for ATP synthesis, which reversed the downregulation of ATP5F, NDUF, and COX7A, and consequently alleviated the elevation of RELA, CAPN1, and RIP3. In conclusion, PM2.5 exposure downregulates ATP5F, NDUF, COX7A, and UQCR, and that inhibits ATP synthesis via the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, which subsequently upregulates RELA and CAPN1 and ultimately leads to necroptosis of BEAS-2B cells.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duan, Shuyin; Zhang, Meihua; Sun, Yaqiong; Fang, Zhenya; Wang, Hefeng; Li, Shuxian; Peng, Yanze; Li, Juan; Li, Junxia; Tian, Jiaqi; Yin, Haoyu; Yao, Sanqiao; Zhang, Lin","journal":"Journal of hazardous materials","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339879/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122747","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP","RELA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PM2","necroptosis of BEAS","inhibiting ATP synthesis","charge of ATP synthesis","B cells","content of ATP","COX7A","NDUF","Exposure","necroptosis indicator","genes of RELA","oxidative phosphorylation","UQCR","viability of BEAS","downregulation of ATP5F","pathway","elevation of RELA","CAPN1 responsible","human bronchial epithelial cells","cytotoxicity mechanism","molecular mechanism","dysregulated genes","expression of RIP3","heavy metals","organic pollutants","knowledge","\u03BCg","central China","m3","enhancer","enzymes","respiratory disorders","Cellular experiments","average concentration","conclusion","N-acetylcysteine"],"language":"en"},

Notably, 5 notifiable infectious diseases have been almost eradicated, and the incidence of 18 additional notifiable infectious diseases has been significantly reduced. Unexpectedly, the incidence of over 10 notifiable infectious diseases, including HIV, brucellosis, syphilis, and dengue fever, has been increasing. Nevertheless, frequent infectious disease outbreaks/events have been reported almost every year, and imported infectious diseases have increased since 2015. New pathogens and over 100 new genotypes or serotypes of known pathogens have been identified. Some infectious diseases seem to be exacerbated by various factors, including rapid urbanization, large numbers of migrant workers, changes in climate, ecology, and policies, such as returning farmland to forests. This review summarizes the current experiences and lessons from China in managing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, especially the effects of ecology, climate, and behavior, which should have merits in helping other countries to control and prevent infectious diseases.

There is limited research on how public health policies have been implemented or what has influenced their implementation. This paper explores policy implementation in two exemplar public health programs -chronic disease prevention and sexually-transmitted infection prevention - in Ontario, Canada. It examines public health service providers\u2019, managers\u2019 and senior managements\u2019 perspectives on the process of implementation of the Ontario Public Health Standards 2008 and factors influencing implementation. METHODS: Public health staff from six health units representing rural, remote, large and small urban settings were included. We conducted 21 focus groups and 18 interviews between 2010 (manager and staff focus groups) and 2011 (senior management interviews) involving 133 participants. Research assistants coded transcripts and researchers reviewed these; the research team discussed and resolved discrepancies. To facilitate a breadth of perspectives, several team members helped interpret the findings. An integrated knowledge translation approach was used, reflected by the inclusion of academics as well as decision-makers on the team and as co-authors. RESULTS: Front line service providers often were unaware of the new policies but managers and senior management incorporated them in operational and program planning. Some participants were involved in policy development or provided feedback prior to their launch. Implementation was influenced by many factors that aligned with Greenhalgh and colleagues\u2019 empirically-based Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organizations Framework. Factors and related components that were most clearly linked to the OPHS policy implementation were: attributes of the innovation itself; adoption by individuals; diffusion and dissemination;the outer context \u2013 interorganizational networks and collaboration; the inner setting \u2013 implementation processes and routinization; and, linkage at the design and implementation stage. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors influenced public health policy implementation. Results provide empirical support for components of Greenhalgh et al\u2019s framework and suggest two additional components \u2013 the role of external organizational collaborations and partnerships as well as planning processes in influencing implementation. These are important to consider by government and public health organizations when promoting new or revised public health policies as they evolve over time. A successful policy implementation process in Ontario has helped to move public health towards the new vision.

Here we report simultaneous outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (MPV; Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) and human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3), in two chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities in the same forest in Uganda in December 2016 and January 2017. The viruses were absent before the outbreaks, but each was present in ill chimpanzees from one community during the outbreak period. Clinical signs and gross pathologic changes in affected chimpanzees closely mirrored symptoms and pathology commonly observed in humans for each virus. Epidemiologic modelling showed that MPV and HRV3 were similarly transmissible (R(0) of 1.27 and 1.48, respectively), but MPV caused 12.2% mortality mainly in infants and older chimpanzees, whereas HRV3 caused no direct mortality. These results are consistent with the higher virulence of MPV than HRV3 in humans, although both MPV and HRV3 cause a significant global disease burden. Both viruses clustered phylogenetically within groups of known human variants, with MPV closely related to a lethal 2009 variant from mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), suggesting two independent and simultaneous reverse zoonotic origins, either directly from humans or via intermediary hosts. These findings expand our knowledge of human origin viruses threatening wild chimpanzees and suggest that such viruses might be differentiated by their comparative epidemiological dynamics and pathogenicity in wild apes.

They are species-specific organisms. Mutation and reassortment have resulted in newer viruses such as H5N1, with new resistance against anti-viral medications, and this might lead to the emergence of a fully transmissible strain, as occurred in the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Influenza viruses are no longer just a cause of self-limited upper respiratory tract infections; the H5N1 avian influenza virus can cause severe human infection with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. The case death rate of H5N1 avian influenza infection is 20 times higher than that of the 1918 infection (50% versus 2.5%), which killed 675000 people in the USA and almost 40 million people worldwide. While the clock is still ticking towards what seems to be inevitable pandemic influenza, on April 17, 2007 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccine against the avian influenza virus H5N1 for humans at high risk. However, more research is needed to develop a more effective and affordable vaccine that can be given at lower doses.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Skeik, Nedaa; Jabr, Fadi I.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89b2443eb035af348d3702963fe3100eb803bb17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110774.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971207001531; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971207001531","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. Food and Drug Administration","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","H5N1 avian influenza virus","avian influenza virus H5N1","case death rate of H5N1 avian influenza infection","inevitable pandemic influenza","newer viruses","people","severe human infection","sophisticated organisms","mortality rate","affordable vaccine","species-specific organisms","cause of self-limited upper respiratory tract infections","structure","mutagenic genomes","humans","new resistance","size","times higher","wide antigenic diversity","anti-viral medications","high risk","FDA","Food","Drug Administration","Summary","reassortment","emergence","transmissible strain","Mutation","USA","lower doses","pandemics","clock","research"],"language":"en"},

This study builds on our prior study based on the scientific premise that YouTube is one of the most effective ways to communicate and mobilize the public in community mitigation to reduce exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVE: Because of the rapidly changing nature of YouTube in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a follow-up study to document how coverage of preventive behaviors for effective community mitigation has changed. METHODS: A successive sampling design was used to compare coverage of behaviors to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos in January 2020 and March 2020. RESULTS: Videos in the January and March samples were viewed \u003E125 million times and \u003E355 million times, respectively. Fewer than half of the videos in either sample covered any of the prevention behaviors recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but many covered key prevention behaviors and were very widely viewed. There were no videos uploaded by entertainment television in the January sample, but this source comprised the majority of videos and garnered the majority of cumulative views in the March sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the incredible reach of YouTube and the potential value of partnership with the entertainment industry for communicating and mobilizing the public about community mitigation to reduce mortality from the COVID-19 viral pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basch, Charles E; Basch, Corey H; Hillyer, Grace C; Jaime, Christie","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175786.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297593/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19145","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YouTube"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["YouTube videos","Effective community mitigation","majority of videos","community transmission of COVID","coverage of behaviors","key prevention behaviors","prior study","follow-up study","coverage of preventive behaviors","mortality","coronavirus disease","incredible reach of YouTube","public","changing nature of YouTube","effective ways","times","entertainment industry","Disease Control","entertainment television","viral pandemic","majority of cumulative views","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","exposure","voluntary behavior change","US Centers","potential value of partnership","best way","context","document","SARS-CoV","scientific premise","BACKGROUND","successive sampling design","METHODS","half","source","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSIONS","Fewer","samples","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Spleen samples of all the animals inoculated with parasites had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for Leishmania DNA. Positive spleen cultures for Leishmania were detected earlier (P\u22640.018) and were more frequent (five out of the five animals) in intravenously infected animals than in the intradermally infected animals, in presence (two out of the six animals) or absence (three out of the five animals) of salivary gland lysate of L. longipalpis. Significant increase in serum antibodies against Leishmania was observed only in the intravenously infected group (P=0.004). In addition, dogs with infection confirmed by isolation of amastigotes or detection of parasite DNA were, nevertheless, negative for anti-Leishmania antibodies up to 5 months or more after infection. Only animals of the intravenously infected group developed progressive decreases in hematocrit (Pearson r=\u22120.8076, P=0.0026) and hemoglobin (Pearson r=\u22120.8403, P=0.0012) during the infection period. No significant difference in the course of infection was observed between groups of intradermally infected animals. The data presented herein confirms that the intradermal inoculation of dogs with Leishmania produces an asymptomatic form of infection. It also fails to show an advantage in using L. longipalpis saliva as an infection-enhancing agent in experimental canine leishmaniasis.","publish_time":"2003-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paranhos-Silva, Moacir; Oliveira, Geraldo G.S.; Reis, Eliana A.; de Menezes, Rejane M.C.; Fernandes, Oct\u00E1vio; Sherlock, \u00CDtalo; Gomes, Regis B.B.; Pontes-de-Carvalho, Lain C.; dos-Santos, Washington L.C.","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a5f03f941fca96bc3d1779b5be1b23a729c76cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126804.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401703001328; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401703001328","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leishmania"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["groups of intradermally infected animals","infected group","Leishmania DNA","course of infection","development of infection","infection period","Leishmania chagasi","anti-Leishmania antibodies","asymptomatic form of infection","presence","Beagle dogs","Pearson r","absence of Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva","intradermal inoculation of dogs","Positive spleen cultures","serum antibodies","Significant increase","significant difference","Spleen samples","detection of parasite DNA","positive polymerase chain reaction tests","parasites","progressive decreases","hematocrit","agent","isolation of amastigotes","disease","salivary gland lysate of","months","experimental canine leishmaniasis","hemoglobin","study","advantage","addition","Abstract","data"],"language":"en"},

Methods We compared a single dose of 100 mg/kg of IV magnesium sulfate vs placebo for acute bronchiolitis. Patients received bronchodilator therapy, nebulized hypertonic saline, and 5 days of dexamethasone if there was eczema and/or a family history of asthma. Time to medical readiness for discharge was the primary efficacy outcome. Bronchiolitis severity scores and need for infirmary or hospital admission and for clinic revisits within 2 weeks were secondary outcomes. Cardiorespiratory instability onset was the safety outcome. Results A total of 162 previously healthy infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis aged 22 days to 17.6 months (median, 3.7 months) were enrolled. Approximately one-half of patients had eczema and/or a family history of asthma; 86.4% had positive findings on nasopharyngeal virus swabs. Geometric mean time until medical readiness for discharge was 24.1 h (95% CI, 20.0-29.1) for the 78 magnesium-treated patients and 25.3 h (95% CI, 20.3-31.5) for the 82 patients receiving placebo (ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.52-1.80]; P = .91). Mean bronchiolitis severity scores over time were similar for the two groups. The frequency of clinic visits in the subsequent 2 weeks (33.8% and 27.2%, respectively) was also similar.

In situ hybridization was used to detect viral RNA expression in cardiac tissue. RESULTS: In all three cases we characterized the genome of a new circovirus we called PCV3 with a replicase and capsid proteins showing 55 and 35 % identities to the genetically-closest proteins from a bat-feces associated circovirus and were even more distant to those of porcine circovirus 1 and 2. Common microscopic lesions included non-suppurative myocarditis and/or cardiac arteriolitis. Viral mRNA was detected intralesionally in cardiac cells.

Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been associated with aberrant gene expression and may lead to pathological conditions. Evidence suggests that miRNA expression profiles are altered between health and disease and as such may be considered as biomarkers of disease. Evidence is increasing that miRNAs are particularly important in lung homeostasis and development and have been demonstrated to be the involved in many pulmonary diseases such as asthma, COPD, sarcoidosis, lung cancer and other smoking related diseases. Better understanding of the function of miRNA and the mechanisms underlying their action in the lung, would help to improve current diagnosis and therapeutics strategies in pulmonary diseases. Recently, some miRNA-based drugs have been introduced as possible therapeutic agents. In this review we aim to summarize the recent findings regarding the role of miRNAs in the airways and lung and emphasise their potential therapeutic roles in pulmonary diseases.","publish_time":"2016-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alipoor, Shamila D.; Adcock, Ian M.; Garssen, Johan; Mortaz, Esmaeil; Varahram, Mohammad; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi; Velayati, Aliakbar","journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f42c3e81104650e84fc1f0f626c72dc5b5a41ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094636.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299916305830; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299916305830; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.09.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary diseases","lung homeostasis","miRNA expression profiles","Dysregulation of miRNA expression","lung cancer","function of miRNA","aberrant gene expression","role of miRNAs","master regulators of gene expression","smoking related diseases","miRNA-based drugs","Evidence","cellular homeostasis","biomarkers of disease","potential therapeutic roles","possible therapeutic agents","COPD","small non-coding RNAs","sarcoidosis","therapeutics strategies","current diagnosis","asthma","biological process","airways","mechanisms","health","recent findings","Abstract MicroRNAs","Better understanding","development","action","pathological conditions","review"],"language":"en"},

Prophylactics and therapies are urgently needed to address this public health problem. We report here the efficacy of a vaccine consisting of chimeric virus-like particles (VLP) expressing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV. In this study, a fusion of the canine parvovirus (CPV) VP2 structural protein gene with the RBD of MERS-CoV can self-assemble into chimeric, spherical VLP (sVLP). sVLP retained certain parvovirus characteristics, such as the ability to agglutinate pig erythrocytes, and structural morphology similar to CPV virions. Immunization with sVLP induced RBD-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. sVLP-specific antisera from these animals were able to prevent pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry into susceptible cells, with neutralizing antibody titers reaching 1: 320. IFN-\u03B3, IL-4 and IL-2 secreting cells induced by the RBD were detected in the splenocytes of vaccinated mice by ELISpot. Furthermore, mice inoculated with sVLP or an adjuvanted sVLP vaccine elicited T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity. Our study demonstrates that sVLP displaying the RBD of MERS-CoV are promising prophylactic candidates against MERS-CoV in a potential outbreak situation.","publish_time":"2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chong; Zheng, Xuexing; Gai, Weiwei; Wong, Gary; Wang, Hualei; Jin, Hongli; Feng, Na; Zhao, Yongkun; Zhang, Weijiao; Li, Nan; Zhao, Guoxing; Li, Junfu; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, Yuwei; Hu, Guixue; Yang, Songtao; Xia, Xianzhu","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ea86045c0a8a03ce313440eb1e887f26a85cae3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113847.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28040513/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.12.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635421630393X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635421630393X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":["CPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RBD of MERS","pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry","sVLP induced RBD-specific humoral","sVLP-specific antisera","adjuvanted sVLP vaccine elicited T-helper","study","splenocytes of vaccinated mice","susceptible cells","canine parvovirus","CPV virions","spherical VLP","chimeric virus","secreting cells","structural morphology similar","certain parvovirus characteristics","potential outbreak situation","potential pandemic threat","VP2 structural protein gene","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","promising prophylactic candidates","cellular immune responses","animals","pig erythrocytes","Th2","Th1","receptor binding domain","neutralizing antibody titers","ability","particles","fusion","Immunization","cell-mediated immunity","ELISpot","IFN-\u03B3","emergence","mortality rate","public health problem","efficacy","Prophylactics","therapies"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a pilot study to assess feasibility of home self- (or parent-) collection of nasal swabs (NS). METHODS: Cystic fibrosis patients aged 6\u201318 years with new respiratory illness participated. In clinic, a deep nasal flocked swab was collected by research staff and compared with an anterior foam NS obtained after instillation of saline spray. At home, up to 2 self-collections of paired foam NS (with and without saline) were collected and mailed for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. RESULTS: Paired swabs were collected from 28 patients: 18 sets in clinic (deep nasal vs saline foam NS) and 43 sets at home (saline vs dry foam NS) with 9 (50%) and 35 (81%) virus detections, respectively. Home-collected NS were obtained closer to illness onset, with a mean difference in symptom days of \u22122.3 between home and clinic collections (95% confidence interval [CI] \u22123.5, \u22121.2; P \u003C .001). Rhinovirus comprised 73% of virus detections; the difference in mean PCR cycle threshold values for rhinovirus between swabs collected at home versus clinic was \u22123.8 (95% CI \u22126.8, \u22120.9; P = .014), indicating significantly higher viral load for home-collected swabs. CONCLUSIONS: Home-collected foam NS had a higher positivity rate compared with clinic-collected swabs, likely because collection was closer to illness onset. Home self-collection is feasible and well tolerated for timely respiratory virus diagnosis and provides a novel approach for clinical diagnostics and surveillance of respiratory virus infections among CF patients.","publish_time":"2013-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Emerson, Julia; Cochrane, Elizabeth; McNamara, Sharon; Kuypers, Jane; Gibson, Ronald L.; Campbell, Angela P.","journal":"Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2259e7c8285b9de7890ce9fe61a86d2059c03aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3869469.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3869469?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/pit039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24363931/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anterior foam NS","feasibility of home self-","clinic collections","deep nasal vs saline foam NS","saline vs dry foam NS","self-collections of paired foam NS","collection of nasal swabs","Paired swabs","virus detections","new respiratory illness","surveillance of respiratory virus infections","timely respiratory virus diagnosis","CF patients","illness onset","Cystic fibrosis patients","mean difference","sets","importance of respiratory viruses","Rhinovirus","instillation of saline spray","CI","deep nasal flocked swab","diagnostic testing","mean PCR cycle threshold values","higher positivity rate","higher viral load","novel approach","clinical diagnostics","children","parent","research staff","years","real-time polymerase chain reaction","hospital","confidence interval","symptom days","pilot study","challenges","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to investigate genetic characterization of new IBV variants isolated from commercial chicken flocks in Korea collected between 2005 and 2010. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all new IBV isolates belonged to Korean group II (K-II), which included the nephropathogenic IBV strains. However, the isolates formed a new gene cluster that was distinguished from the two distinct K-II subgroups (KM91-like and QX-like). Recombination events were identified in the S1 gene, with their putative parental strains being the KM91-like or QX-like subgroup. In addition, two crossover sites were observed in the S1 gene of IBV isolates. These results suggest that natural genetic recombination between heterologous strains classified into different genetic groups has occurred and may have caused the emergence of new IBV strains.

To explore the relationship between national and global processes for governing global health, this paper asks: in what forms of interaction between NPGH arenas and global health governance are learning and networking processes present? In a multiple case study of Norwegian and Swiss NPGH arenas, we collected data on intersectoral policy processes from semi-structured interviews with 33 informants in 2014-2015. Adapting Real-Dato\u2019s framework, we analyzed each case separately, producing monographs for comparing NPGH arenas. Analyzing both NPGH arenas for relational structures linking external resources to internal policy arena processes, we found five zones of interactions - including institutions, transgovernmental clubs, and connective forms.

An analysis of captured digital images showed that the exhaled air at the peak of simulated exhalation reached a distance of approximately 0.40 m.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hui, David S.; Ip, Margaret; Tang, Julian W.; Wong, Alexandra L.N.; Chan, Matthew T.V.; Hall, Stephen D.; Chan, Paul K.S.; Sung, Joseph J.Y.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094573.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094573/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious exhaled air","simple oxygen mask","oxygen masks","use of supplemental oxygen","sources of aerosolized infectious pathogens","human lung model","respiration rate","peak of simulated exhalation","common setting","digital images","surrounding area","fine tracer smoke particles","respiratory infections","hospital","breaths","risk","distance","potential","Patients","analysis","laser sheet"],"language":"en"},

In previous studies, the level of social contact permitted in individual housing has been auditory, visual, or physical contact. It is unclear how these various levels of social contact compare with each other and to pair housing, when their effects on behavior and health are considered, and whether the timing of pair housing has an effect. To investigate this, 110 Holstein calves (50 males, 60 females) in 11 blocks were paired according to birth date. Within 60 h of birth, each pair of calves was allocated to 1 of 5 treatments: individual housing with auditory contact (I), individual housing with auditory and visual contact (V), individual housing with auditory, visual, and tactile contact (T), pair housing (P), or individual housing with auditory and visual contact the first 2 wk followed by pair housing (VP). At 6 wk of age, calves were subjected to a social test and a novel environment test. In the social test, all pair-housed calves (P and VP) had a shorter latency to sniff an unfamiliar calf than did individually housed calves (I, V, and T), whereas calves with physical contact (T, P, and VP) sniffed the unfamiliar calf for longer than calves on the remaining treatments (I and V). In the novel environment test, calves with physical contact (T, P, and VP) had a lower heart rate, and more of these calves vocalized during the test compared with calves without physical contact (I and V). No effect of treatment was found for clinical scores, levels of the 5 most common pathogens in feces, or in development of serum antibodies against the 3 most common respiratory pathogens. Calves housed individually are more fearful of unfamiliar calves than are pair-housed calves. Contrary to common belief, the allowance of physical contact and pair housing had no effects on the health of the calves.","publish_time":"2014-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jensen, Margit Bak; Larsen, Lars Erik","journal":"J Dairy Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094583.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pair of calves","pair-housed calves","auditory contact","visual contact","individual housing","dairy calves","Holstein calves","timing of pair housing","tactile contact","close contact","fearful of unfamiliar calves","allowance of physical contact","level of social contact","various levels of social contact","social test","VP","novel environment test","health","unfamiliar calf","common pathogens","effects","common belief","common respiratory pathogens","remaining treatments","wk of age","effect of treatment","birth date","h of birth","environmental situations","concerns","behavioral responses","shorter latency","development of serum antibodies","feces","young animals","clinical scores","previous studies","lower heart rate","blocks","females","pairs"],"language":"en"},

The recent human infections with H7N9 virus, totalling over 130 cases with 39 fatalities to date, have been characterized by severe pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(2). This is concerning because H7 viruses have typically been associated with ocular disease in humans, rather than severe respiratory disease(3). This recent outbreak underscores the need to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals. Here we assess the ability of A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses, isolated from fatal human cases, to cause disease in mice and ferrets and to transmit to naive animals. Both H7N9 viruses replicated to higher titre in human airway epithelial cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets compared to a seasonal H3N2 virus. Moreover, the H7N9 viruses showed greater infectivity and lethality in mice compared to genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H7N9 viruses were readily transmitted to naive ferrets through direct contact but, unlike the seasonal H3N2 virus, did not transmit readily by respiratory droplets. The lack of efficient respiratory droplet transmission was corroborated by low receptor-binding specificity for human-like \u03B12,6-linked sialosides. Our results indicate that H7N9 viruses have the capacity for efficient replication in mammals and human airway cells and highlight the need for continued public health surveillance of this emerging virus.

By contrast, the enormous interindividual variability in susceptibility to influenza has received very little attention. One interesting hypothesis is that interindividual variability is driven largely by the genetic makeup of the infected patients.

Four monogenic causes of severe influenza pneumonitis\u2014deficiencies of GATA2, IRF7, IRF9, and TLR3\u2014have provided evidence that severe influenza pneumonitis can be genetic and often in patients with no other severe infections.

Information about disease severity can be obtained by investigating intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, especially when historical comparisons can be made with cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in 155 ICUs contributing to the GiViTI national database. To assess the impact on ICU workload, the occupancy rate during the epidemic phase was compared with influenza periods in previous years. A logistic regression model was developed to assess the prognostic importance of A(H1N1) influenza. RESULTS: The characteristics of the 319 A(H1N1) cases were similar to those reported in other studies, confirming the young age of patients (mean 43 years) and the higher prevalence among pregnant women and obese people. At the epidemic\u2019s peak (October\u2013December 2009) the occupancy rate did not significantly differ from the same period of the previous year, and was significantly lower than the 2009 seasonal influenza outbreak (January\u2013March 2009). Compared with CAP of other origin (3,678 patients), A(H1N1) pneumonia was associated with a lower risk of death. However, after adjusting for confounding this was no longer the case (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59\u20131.31; p = 0.52). CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the specific features of critically ill A(H1N1) patients (i.e., young age, pregnancy, obesity). The pandemic did not increase ICU workload compared with other periods. A(H1N1) pneumonia did not have a higher risk of death than CAP of different origin among patients admitted to the ICU.

Design: Retrospective study from July 1986 to February 1996. Setting: Medical intensive care unit at a university hospital. Patients: Fifty-seven patients with primary lung cancer admitted to our medical intensive care unit (MICU). Measurements and results: Data collection included demographic data (age, sex, underlying diseases, MICU admitting diagnosis) and evaluation of tumor (pathologic subtypes, metastases, lung cancer staging, treatment options). Three indexes were calculated for each patient: Karnofsky performance status, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, and multisystem organ failure score (ODIN score). Mortality was high in the MICU: 66% of patients died during their MICU stay, and hospital mortality reached 75%. In multivariate analysis, acute pulmonary disease and Karnofsky performance status \u003C70 were associated with a poor MICU and post-MICU prognosis. For the survivors, long-term survival after MICU discharge depended exclusively on the severity of the lung cancer. Conclusions: We confirmed the high mortality rate of lung cancer patients admitted to the MICU. Two predictive factors of death in MICU were identified: performance status \u003C70 and acute pulmonary disease.","publish_time":"2000-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boussat, S.; El\u0027rini, T.; Dubiez, A.; Depierre, A.; Barale, F.; Capellier, G.","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d81529782e3d0009d2259729028ea7cf74f9eff8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzUzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Karnofsky"],"organizations":["MICU","Simplified Acute Physiology Score"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MICU discharge","poor MICU","post-MICU prognosis","lung cancer staging","primary lung cancer","high mortality rate of lung cancer patients","lung cancer patient\u0027s prognosis","Medical intensive care unit","Karnofsky performance status","hospital mortality","Acute Physiology Score","acute pulmonary disease","ODIN score","early predictive factors of death","Data collection","demographic data","multisystem organ failure score","university hospital","age","metastases","pathologic subtypes","sex","underlying diseases","evaluation of tumor","results","diagnosis","SAPS","multivariate analysis","treatment options","survivors","long-term survival","Setting","severity","Measurements","Design","Retrospective study","Conclusions","Objective","indexes"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This was a prospective, observational, multicenter, international study conducted at 13 intensive care units (ICUs); thirty consecutive adults mechanically ventilated for \u2265 48 h per site were eligible, with daily follow-up being recorded in a collaborative web database; VAEs were assessed using the 2013 CDC classification and its 2015 update. RESULTS: A total of 2856 ventilator days in 244 patients were analyzed, identifying 33 VAP and 51 VAT episodes; 30-day ICU mortality was significantly higher (42.8 vs. 19.6%, p \u003C 0.007) in patients with VAP than in those with VAT. According to the 2013 CDC definitions, 117 VAEs were identified: 113 (96%) were infection-related ventilator-associated complication-plus (IVAC-plus), while possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (PVAP) was found in 64 (56.6%) of them. VAE increased the number of ventilator days and prolonged ICU and hospital LOS (by 5, 11, and 12 days, respectively), with a trend towards increased 30-day mortality (43 vs 28%, p = 0.06). Most episodes (26, 55%) classified as IVAC-plus without PVAP criteria were due to atelectasis. PVAP significantly increased (p \u003C 0.05) ventilator days as well as ICU and hospital LOS (by 10.5, 14, and 13 days, respectively). Only 24 (72.7%) of VAP and 15 (29.4%) of VAT episodes met IVAC-plus criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory infections (mainly VAT) were the most common complication. VAE algorithms only identified events with surrogates of severe oxygenation deterioration. As a consequence, IVAC definitions missed one fourth of the episodes of VAP and three fourths of the episodes of VAT. Identifying VAT (often missed by IVAC-plus criteria) is important, as VAP and VAT have different impacts on mortality.

We assessed whether haplotypes in the EPCR gene modify the risk of severe sepsis and/or septic shock (SS/SS) development in critically ill patients. METHODS: Three polymorphisms in the EPCR gene were genotyped in 389 Caucasian critically ill patients, hospitalized in the intensive care units of two major hospitals in Athens, Greece. Multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling for age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, sex, and diagnosis was performed to determine the effect of haplotypes H1 and H3 in the EPCR gene on the development of SS/SS. RESULTS: H2 carriers versus all other genotypes combined had a nonsignificant excess of SS/SS (p = 0.087). SS/SS occurred in 38.8 % of critically ill patients carrying minor alleles belonging to both H1 and H3 haplotypes, in 58.0 % of H1 carriers, 64.3 % of H3 carriers, and 65.2 % of patients carrying all common alleles (H2). Compared with H2 carriers, the odds ratios (OR) for developing SS/SS were 0.34 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.16\u20130.76, p = 0.008] for simultaneous H1 and H3 carriers, 0.65 (95 % CI 0.37\u20131.13, p = 0.123) for H1 carriers, and 0.82 (95 % CI 0.39\u20131.70, p = 0.590) for H3 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that simultaneous carriers of minor alleles belonging to both the H1 and H3 haplotypes may be at reduced risk of developing SS/SS in this cohort of critically ill patients.","publish_time":"2013-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vassiliou, Alice G.; Maniatis, Nikolaos A.; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Kallergi, Marina; Karystinaki, Foteini S.; Letsiou, Eleftheria; Glynos, Constantinos; Kopterides, Petros; Vassiliadi, Dimitra; Nikitas, Nikitas; Dimopoulou, Ioanna; Armaganidis, Apostolos; Orfanos, Stylianos E.","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4fbdb7554f4ca881d092572c88d1e2648e496b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzU4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EPCR","SS/SS","SS"],"locations":["Athens","Greece"],"keyphrases":["H1 carriers","H3 carriers","development of SS","H2 carriers","H3 haplotypes","ill patients","nonsignificant excess of SS","reduced risk of developing SS","simultaneous H1","simultaneous carriers of minor alleles","effect of haplotypes H1","EPCR gene","CI","RESULTS","common alleles","Endothelial protein C receptor","endothelial cells","risk of severe sepsis","anticoagulant pathways of protein","age","APACHE","acute physiology","major hospitals","scores","SOFA","sequential organ failure assessment","chronic health evaluation","intensive care units","septic shock","regulation","Multivariate logistic regression analysis","cohort","Athens","sex","cytoprotective","PURPOSE","genotypes","Caucasian","odds ratios","diagnosis","Greece","polymorphisms","confidence interval","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Microbiological confirmation of infection is strongly encouraged. Which sampling method to use is still a matter of controversy. Emerging microbiological tools will likely modify our routine approach to diagnosing and treating VAP in the next future. Prevention of VAP is based on minimizing the exposure to mechanical ventilation and encouraging early liberation. Bundles that combine multiple prevention strategies may improve outcomes, but large randomized trials are needed to confirm this. Treatment should be limited to 7 days in the vast majority of the cases.

In addition, experimental and clinical studies identified Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization as a risk factor for P. aeruginosa pneumonia. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of antifungal treatment on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheobronchial colonization due to P. aeruginosa. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational case\u2013control study conducted in a 30-bed ICU during a 1-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and two patients intubated and ventilated for longer than 48 h with tracheobronchial colonization by Candida spp. Routine screening for Candida spp. and P. aeruginosa was performed at ICU admission and weekly. Antifungal treatment was based on medical staff decisions. Patients with P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization were matched (1:2) with patients without P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization. In case and control patients, risk factors for P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (35%) received antifungal treatment. Nineteen patients (18%) developed a P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization, and all were successfully matched. Antifungal treatment [31% vs 60%; p = 0.037, OR (95% CI) = 0.67 (0.45\u20130.90)], and duration of antifungal treatment (7 \u00B1 11 vs 14 \u00B1 14 days; p = 0.045, in case and control patients respectively) were significantly associated with reduced risk for P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization.

The aim of the study was to identify predictors of mortality and to develop a score allowing a better stratification of patients at the time of VV ECMO initiation. METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter cohort study on 60 patients with influenza A (H1N1)-associated respiratory distress syndrome participating in the Italian ECMOnet data set in the 2009 pandemic. Criteria for ECMO institution were standardized according to national guidelines. RESULTS: The survival rate in patients treated with ECMO was 68 %. Significant predictors of death before ECMO institution by multivariate analysis were hospital length of stay before ECMO institution (OR = 1.52, 95 % CI 1.12\u20132.07, p = 0.008); bilirubin (OR = 2.32, 95 % CI 1.52\u20133.52, p \u003C 0.001), creatinine (OR = 7.38, 95 % CI 1.43\u201338.11, p = 0.02) and hematocrit values (OR = 0.82, 95 % CI 0.72\u20130.94, p = 0.006); and mean arterial pressure (OR = 0.92, 95 % CI 0.88\u20130.97, p \u003C 0.001). The ECMOnet score was developed based on these variables, with a score of 4.5 being the most appropriate cutoff for mortality risk prediction. The high accuracy of the ECMOnet score was further confirmed by ROC analysis (c = 0.857, 95 % CI 0.754\u20130.959, p \u003C 0.001) and by an independent external validation analysis (c = 0.694, 95 % CI 0.562\u20130.826, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality risk for patients receiving VV ECMO is correlated to the extrapulmonary organ function at the time of ECMO initiation.

DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: A university hospital pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Nineteen children with ARDS (PaO(2)/FIO(2)\u003C200) unresponsive to conventional ventilation treated with HFO from January 1995 to September 1996. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The following were recorded: demographic, arterial blood gas and ventilator variables at the time points 0, 6, 12 and 24 h after the start of HFO; PRISM in the first 24 h of admission and pediatric respiratory failure and multiple organ system failure scores on the day of starting HFO. The mortality rate was 26% (5/19). The survival was better than predicted by the Pediatric Respiratory Failure score (p\u003C0.01). None of the scores differentiated survivors from non-survivors (p\u003E0.25). There was no significant change in oxygenation index over the first 24 h (p\u003E0.18). Of patients with an initial oxygenation index higher than 20 who did not have at least a 20% reduction in oxygenation index by the time 6 h, 6/9 (67%) survived (sensitivity 75%, specificity 57%). CONCLUSIONS: Survival in pediatric ARDS patients treated with HFO could not be predicted using several outcome scores or the oxygenation index (in the first 24 h). Survival was significantly better than predicted by the Pediatric Respiratory Failure score. A prospective randomized controlled trial of HFO in ARDS is warranted.","publish_time":"2003-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anton, Natalie; Joffe, Kenneth M.; Joffe, Ari R.","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3abe6a203934ae198f3d855091b7cb6e88863bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095387.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095387/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","HFO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric ARDS patients","Pediatric Respiratory Failure score","pediatric mortality scores","start of HFO","oxygenation index changes","day of starting HFO","initial oxygenation index higher","h of admission","observed survival","outcome scores","multiple organ system failure scores","prospective randomized controlled trial of HFO","children","conventional ventilation","university hospital pediatric intensive care unit","acute respiratory distress syndrome","time points","non-survivors","mortality rate","ventilator variables","arterial blood gas","demographic","high-frequency oscillation","following","SETTING","CONCLUSIONS","DESIGN","Retrospective","observational study","experience","PaO","significant change","PRISM","reduction","MEASUREMENTS","RESULTS","sensitivity","specificity","FIO","OBJECTIVE","INTERVENTIONS"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations. METHODS: Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (ESM 1 - supplemental table 1) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science. RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: (1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times?; (2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?; (3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice?; (4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock?; (5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality?; and (6) what information identifies organ dysfunction? CONCLUSIONS: While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

DISCUSSION: The accompanying review by Vad\u00E1sz et al. details our current understanding of the signaling mechanisms and cellular processes that facilitate clearance of edema fluid from the alveolar compartment, and how these signaling processes may be exploited in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To complement that report this review focuses on how intact organ and animal models and clinical studies have facilitated our understanding of alveolar edema fluid clearance in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, it considers how what we have learned from these animal and organ models and clinical studies has suggested novel therapeutic avenues to pursue.","publish_time":"2007-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morty, Rory E.; Eickelberg, Oliver; Seeger, Werner","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fee13458c2afb3c9dac6c04c0ccf070d703f54d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095514.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clearance of edema fluid","understanding of alveolar edema fluid clearance","mechanisms of alveolar edema fluid clearance","Acute lung injury","acute respiratory distress syndrome","alveolar compartment","clinical studies","mortality","organ models","animal models","novel therapeutic avenues","intact organ","current understanding","cellular processes","development of novel therapeutic strategies","accompanying review","significant causes of morbidity","Vad\u00E1sz","conditions","major contributing factor","intensive care setting","DISCUSSION","BACKGROUND","failure of patients"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gossypol on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. METHODS: Male BALB/c mice were pretreated with gossypol 1 h before intranasal instillation of LPS. Then, 7 h after LPS administration, the myeloperoxidase in histology of lungs, lung wet/dry ratio and inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1\u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2) in the BALF were measured by ELISA. The extent of phosphorylation of I\u03BAB-\u03B1, p65 NF-\u03BAB, p46\u2013p54 JNK, p42\u2013p44 ERK, and p38 were detected by western blot. RESULTS: Gossypol markedly attenuated the LPS-induced histological alterations in the lung and inhibited the production of TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2 and IL-6. Additionally, gossypol reduced the inflammatory cells in BALF, decreased the wet/dry ratio of lungs and inhibited the phosphorylation of I\u03BAB-\u03B1, p65 NF-\u03BAB, p46\u2013p54 JNK, p42\u2013p44 ERK, and p38 caused by LPS. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that anti-inflammatory effects of gossypol against the LPS-induced ALI may be due to its ability of inhibition of the NF-\u03BAB and MAPKs signaling pathways. Gossypol may be a promising potential therapeutic reagent for ALI treatment.","publish_time":"2013-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zhicheng; Yang, Zhengtao; Fu, Yunhe; Li, Fenyang; Liang, Dejie; Zhou, Ershun; Song, Xiaojing; Zhang, Wen; Zhang, Xichen; Cao, Yongguo; Zhang, Naisheng","journal":"Inflamm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a497bd14ffb88744e198b9a5a9964ef80d3f82ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095812.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of gossypol","LPS-induced ALI","TNF-\u03B1","I\u03BAB-\u03B1","LPS administration","anti-inflammatory effects of gossypol","BALF","p65 NF-\u03BAB","intranasal instillation of LPS","lung wet","p54 JNK","p42","p46","inflammatory cells","dry ratio of lungs","p44 ERK","ALI treatment","phosphorylation of I\u03BAB","p38","interleukin","levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","acute lung injury","histology of lungs","production of TNF","c mice","extent of phosphorylation","anti-inflammatory properties","myeloperoxidase","promising potential therapeutic reagent","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","METHODS","Male BALB","data","lipopolysaccharide","ability of inhibition","MAPKs","pathways","histological alterations","study","western blot","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","purpose","ELISA","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Most of the current recommendations refer to outpatients or mild diseases and are not always suitable and practicable for the management of a life-threatening influenza A/H1N1v infection in an intensive care setting. The aim of this review is to present a reliable diagnostic and therapeutic approach for critically ill patients, considering the current literature, case-based experiences from our own intensive care unit and including relevant recommendations of public health authorities. Initial measures regarding therapeutic, diagnostic and isolation precautions arise from past medical history, current anamnesis and characteristic symptoms and their progression. Patients suspected of having acquired an influenza A/H1N1v infection should be isolated. Early laboratory diagnosis of A/H1N1v infection ideally utilizes the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the most sensitive diagnostic method. Emerging evidence suggests that incidence and severity of life-threatening influenza A/H1N1v infection increase with several risk factors (e.g. pregnancy, immunosuppression, obesity). Treatment decisions should not be delayed to await laboratory confirmation in these patients as early initiation of antiviral therapy is recommended. Elements of supportive care depend on the presentation of complications and secondary organ failure. If rapidly progressive lung dysfunction occurs, refractory to routine mechanical ventilation, early reporting to centers experienced in the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be established.","publish_time":"2010-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00FCrkle, M.A.; Frey, L.; Zwi\u00DFler, B.","journal":"Anaesthesist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e93750ba0a7ba4311adad3900bf101e2b1cee56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096038.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096038/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozc4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1v infection","intensive care treatment","intensive care unit","intensive care setting","current recommendations","ill patients","majority of patients","severity of life-threatening influenza","current anamnesis","current literature","early reporting","reliable diagnostic","Early laboratory diagnosis","Elements of supportive care","novel pandemic influenza","isolated cases severe complications","sensitive diagnostic method","presentation of complications","therapeutic approach","early initiation of antiviral therapy","mild diseases","laboratory confirmation","rapid increase","Treatment decisions","number of new cases","mild clinical course","relevant recommendations of public health authorities","past medical history","refractory","hospitalization","routine mechanical ventilation","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","isolation precautions","RT-PCR","centers","case-based experiences","characteristic symptoms","incidence","risk factors","use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","pregnancy","immunosuppression","ECMO","progressive lung dysfunction","secondary organ failure","management","outpatients","Initial measures","Emerging evidence","progression","Germany","review","obesity","aim"],"language":"en"},

L-SIGN, encoded by CLEC4M (also known as CD209L), is a SARS-CoV binding receptor that has polymorphism in its extracellular neck region encoded by the tandem repeat domain in exon 4. Our genetic risk association study shows that individuals homozygous for CLEC4M tandem repeats are less susceptible to SARS infection. L-SIGN is expressed in both non-SARS and SARS-CoV\u2013infected lung. Compared with cells heterozygous for L-SIGN, cells homozygous for L-SIGN show higher binding capacity for SARS-CoV, higher proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a lower capacity for trans infection. Thus, homozygosity for L-SIGN plays a protective role during SARS infection.

Recent systematic reviews have demonstrated that most URTIs resolve naturally, even when bacteria are the cause. The high consumer expectation for antibacterials in URTIs requires intervention by the general practitioner and a number of useful strategies have been developed. Generic strategies, including eliciting patient expectations, avoiding the term \u2018just a virus\u2019, providing a value-for-money consultation, providing verbal and written information, empowering patients, conditional prescribing, directed education campaigns, and emphasis on symptomatic treatments, should be used as well as discussion of alternative medicines when relevant. The various conditions have differing rates of bacterial infection and require different approaches. For acute rhinitis, laryngitis and tracheitis, viruses are the only cause and, therefore, antibacterials are never required. In acute sore throat (pharyngitis) Streptococcus pyogenes is the only important bacterial cause. A scoring system can help to increase the likelihood of distinguishing a streptococcal as opposed to viral infection, or alternatively patients should be given antibacterials only if certain conditions are fulfilled. Strategies for treating acute otitis media vary in different countries. Most favour the strategy of prescribing antibacterials only when certain criteria are fulfilled, delaying antibacterial prescribing for at least 24 hours. In otitis media with effusion, on the other hand, there is no primary role for antibacterials, as the condition resolves naturally in almost all patients aged \u003E3 months. Detailed strategies for acute sinusitis have not been worked out but restricting antibacterial prescribing to certain clinical complexes is currently recommended by several authorities because of the high natural resolution rate.","publish_time":"2012-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turnidge, John","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14cc67e93ef3e1427ffb7ea72a298601b22a8c57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099238.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099238/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzkxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibacterial prescribing","strategy of prescribing antibacterials","URTIs","acute otitis media","conditional prescribing","acute rhinitis","acute sinusitis","Generic strategies","certain conditions","Detailed strategies","empowering patients","acute sore throat","certain criteria","number of useful strategies","important bacterial cause","rates of bacterial infection","certain clinical complexes","community antibacterial use","different countries","viral infection","different approaches","various conditions","high consumer expectation","high natural resolution rate","written information","Streptococcus pyogenes","education campaigns","general practitioner","authorities","eliciting patient expectations","pharyngitis","tracheitis","intervention","money consultation","Upper respiratory tract infections","term","emphasis","viruses","laryngitis","symptomatic treatments","primary role","discussion of alternative medicines","value","hand","effusion","Recent systematic reviews","likelihood","hours","scoring system","months"],"language":"en"},

Unlike other multishelled reoviruses, cypovirus has a single-layered capsid, thereby representing a simplified model for studying vRNA replication of reoviruses. VP5 is one of the three major cypovirus capsid proteins and functions as a clamp protein to stabilize cypovirus capsid. Here, we expressed VP5 from type 5 Helicoverpa armigera cypovirus (HaCPV-5) in a eukaryotic system and determined that this VP5 possesses RNA chaperone-like activity, which destabilizes RNA helices and accelerates strand annealing independent of ATP. Our further characterization of VP5 revealed that its helix-destabilizing activity is RNA specific, lacks directionality and could be inhibited by divalent ions, such as Mg(2\u002B), Mn(2\u002B), Ca(2\u002B) or Zn(2\u002B), to varying degrees. Furthermore, we found that HaCPV-5 VP5 facilitates the replication initiation of an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through a panhandle-structured RNA template, which mimics the 5\u2032-3\u2032 cyclization of cypoviral positive-stranded RNA. Given that the replication of negative-stranded vRNA on the positive-stranded vRNA template necessitates the dissociation of the 5\u2032-3\u2032 panhandle, the RNA chaperone activity of VP5 may play a direct role in the initiation of reoviral dsRNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2013-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Jie; Cheng, Zhenyun; Zhang, Songliu; Xiong, Wei; Xia, Hongjie; Qiu, Yang; Wang, Zhaowei; Wu, Feige; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Yin, Lei; Hu, Yuanyang; Zhou, Xi","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2b6aa71fbb89c9a10e9b00f36313ba5be05b025.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3936753.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24319147/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1256","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","Helicoverpa","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA chaperone activity of VP5","viral RNA","RNA specific","RNA helices","double-stranded RNA","characterization of VP5","vRNA replication of reoviruses","panhandle-structured RNA template","cyclization of cypoviral positive-stranded RNA","positive-stranded vRNA template","replication initiation","replication of negative","major cypovirus capsid proteins","Helicoverpa armigera cypovirus","HaCPV","helix-destabilizing activity","single-layered capsid","initiation of reoviral dsRNA synthesis","multishelled reoviruses","inner capsids function","family Reoviridae","functions","machinery","clamp protein","alternative polymerase","direct role","type","simplified model","reverse transcriptase","directionality","independent of ATP","dissociation","eukaryotic system","divalent ions","Mn","Zn","degrees"],"language":"en"},

Rescued virus particles could be harvested by directly transfecting the DNA-launched recombinant plasmid to the host cells, which will reduce labor and experimental cost by skipping the in vitro transcription assay. METHODS: A total of four overlapping fragments covering the entire viral genome were amplified and then were assembled into a transformation vector based on pIRES2-EGFP to establish the DNA-launched infectious system of duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (DHAV-1), named pIR-DHAV-1. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting assay and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) were conducted for rescued virus identification. A total of 4.0 \u03BCg of recombinant plasmid of pIR-DHAV-1 and in vitro transcribed product of 4.0 \u03BCg of RNA-launched infectious clone named pR-DHAV-1 were transfected into BHK-21 cells to analyze the rescue efficiency. Following that, tissue tropism of rescued virus (rDHAV-1) and parental virus (pDHAV-1) were assayed for virulence testing in 1-day-old ducklings. RESULTS: Rescued virus particles carry the designed genetic marker which could be harvested by directly transfecting pIR-DHAV-1 to BHK-21 cells. The qRT-PCR and western blotting results indicated that rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics with pDHAV-1. Furthermore, DNA-launched infectious system possessed much higher rescue efficiency assay compared to RNA-launched infectious system. The mutation at position 3042 from T to C has no impact on viral replication and tissue tropism. From 1 h post infection (hpi) to 48 hpi, the viral RNA copies of rDHAV-1 in liver were the highest among the six tested tissues (with an exception of thymus at 6 hpi), while the viral RNA copy numbers in heart and kidney were alternately the lowest. CONCLUSION: We have constructed a genetically stable and highly pathogenic DNA-launched infectious clone, from which the rescued virus could be harvested by direct transfection with recombinant plasmids. rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics and tissue tropism with pDHAV-1. The DNA-launched infectious system of DHAV-1 possessed higher rescue efficiency compared to the traditional RNA-launched infectious system.","publish_time":"2017-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Junhao; Zhang, Ruihua; Lin, Shaoli; Li, Pengfei; Lan, Jingjing; Xie, Zhijing; Wang, Yu; Jiang, Shijin","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69003af6f71b1554fa58853d5d29d1dffd9afc24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5670519.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0883-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100535/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious system of DHAV","infectious clone","Rescued virus particles","tissue tropism of rescued virus","pIR-DHAV","rescued virus identification","infectious system of duck hepatitis","virus type","parental virus","viral RNA copies of rDHAV","\u03BCg of RNA","pR-DHAV","pathogenic DNA","higher rescue efficiency assay","traditional RNA","viral RNA copy numbers","high rescue efficiency","viral replication","hpi","pDHAV","qRT-PCR","transcription assay","\u03BCg of recombinant plasmid of pIR","western blotting assay","entire viral genome","individual viral element","shared similar growth characteristics","western blotting results","recombinant plasmids","total","host cells","BHK","Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","detection","heart","impact","IFA","useful tool","overlapping fragments","function","kidney","introduction of mutations","indirect immunofluorescence","designed genetic marker","direct transfection","specific positions","labor","pIRES2-EGFP","transcribed product","tested tissues","exception of thymus","experimental cost","h post infection","virulence testing","day-old ducklings","transformation vector","liver","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Time is the most important factor in rapidly developing and epidemiologically dangerous diseases, such as influenza, Ebola and SARS.

Over the last years, aptamer technology has been used in a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications and, concretely, several strategies are currently being explored using aptamers against virus proteins. From a diagnostics point of view, aptamers are being designed as a bio-recognition element in diagnostic systems to detect viral proteins either in the blood (serum or plasma) or into infected cells. Another potential use of aptamers is for therapeutics of viral infections, interfering in the interaction between the virus and the host using aptamers targeting host-cell matrix receptors, or attacking the virus intracellularly, targeting proteins implicated in the viral replication cycle. In this paper, we review how aptamers working against viral proteins are discovered, with a focus on recent advances that improve the aptamers\u2019 properties as a real tool for viral infection detection and treatment.","publish_time":"2016-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonz\u00E1lez, V\u00EDctor M.; Mart\u00EDn, M.

For example, Ribonucleases (RNases) are enzymes relevant to several biologic processes; then, theoretical and experimental study of the molecular diversity of Peptide Mass Fingerprints (PMFs) of RNases is useful for drug design. This study introduces a methodology that combines QSAR models, 2D-Electrophoresis (2D-E), MALDI-TOF Mass Spectroscopy (MS), BLAST alignment, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) to explore PMFs of RNases. We illustrate this approach by investigating for the first time the PMFs of a new protein of L. infantum. Here we report and compare new versus old predictive models for RNases based on Topological Indices (TIs) of Markov Pseudo-Folding Lattices. These group of indices called Pseudo-folding Lattice 2D-TIs include: Spectral moments \u03C0 (k)(x,y), Mean Electrostatic potentials \u03BE (k)(x,y), and Entropy measures \u03B8 (k)(x,y). The accuracy of the models (training/cross-validation) was as follows: \u03BE (k)(x,y)-model (96.0%/91.7%)\u003E\u03C0 (k)(x,y)-model (84.7/83.3) \u003E \u03B8 (k)(x,y)-model (66.0/66.7). We also carried out a 2D-E analysis of biological samples of L. infantum promastigotes focusing on a 2D-E gel spot of one unknown protein with M\u003C20, 100 and pI \u003C7. MASCOT search identified 20 proteins with Mowse score \u003E30, but not one \u003E52 (threshold value), the higher value of 42 was for a probable DNA-directed RNA polymerase. However, we determined experimentally the sequence of more than 140 peptides. We used QSAR models to predict RNase scores for these peptides and BLAST alignment to confirm some results. We also calculated 3D-folding TIs based on MD experiments and compared 2D versus 3D-TIs on molecular phylogenetic analysis of the molecular diversity of these peptides. This combined strategy may be of interest in drug development or target identification.

{"cord_uid":"w4re2x07","sha":null,"source_x":"PMC","title":"Short communication: antiviral activity of porcine IFN-\u03BB3 against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in vitro","doi":"10.1007/s11262-016-1374-2","pmcid":"PMC7089062","pubmed_id":"27470155","license":"no-cc","abstract":"A new family of IFNs called type III IFN or IFN-\u03BB has been described, and shown to induce antiviral activity against several viruses in the cell culture. In this study, the molecular cloning, expression, and antiporcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) activity of porcine IFN-\u03BB3 (poIFN-\u03BB3) were reported. The full-length poIFN-\u03BB3 cDNA sequence encoded 196 amino acids with a 23 amino acid signal peptide. Sequence alignments showed that poIFN-\u03BB3 had an amino acid sequence similarity to Ovis aries (78.1 %), Bos taurus (76.0 %), Tupaia belangeri (71.3 %), Equus caballus (69.9 %), and Homo sapiens (69.9 %). The phylogenetic analysis based on the genomic sequences indicated that poIFN-\u03BB3 is located in the same branch as B. taurus and O. aries IFN-\u03BB3. The poIFN-\u03BB3 without a signal anchor sequence was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant poIFN-\u03BB3 exhibited significant antiviral effects against PEDV in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of poIFN-\u03BB3 on PEDV was observed under three different treatment conditions. The highest inhibition of PEDV was observed in Vero E6 cell cultures pretreated with poIFN-\u03BB3 (prior to PEDV infection). In addition, poIFN-\u03BB3 was able to induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, including ISG15, OAS1, and Mx1 in Vero E6 cells. These data demonstrate that poIFN-\u03BB3 has antiviral activity against PEDV and may serve as a useful biotherapeutic candidate to inhibit PEDV or other viruses in swine.","publish_time":"2016-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Haiyan; Zhang, Chunhong; Guo, Pengju; Liu, Zhicheng; Sun, Minhua; Sun, Junying; Li, Linlin; Dong, Jiawen; Zhang, Jianfeng","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089062.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089062/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aries IFN-\u03BB3","purified recombinant poIFN-\u03BB3","full-length poIFN-\u03BB3 cDNA sequence","activity of porcine IFN-\u03BB3","PEDV infection","inhibitory effect of poIFN","expression of IFN","highest inhibition of PEDV","antiviral activity","amino acid sequence similarity","Sequence alignments","signal anchor sequence","amino acids","amino acid signal peptide","viruses","Vero E6 cell cultures","significant antiviral effects","Vero E6 cells","Ovis aries","Bos taurus","antiporcine epidemic diarrhea virus","OAS1","dose","type","Mx1","ISG15","stimulated genes","Escherichia coli","genomic sequences","molecular cloning","new family of IFNs","useful biotherapeutic candidate","time-dependent manner","phylogenetic analysis","study","branch","addition","different treatment conditions","Tupaia belangeri","swine","data","Equus caballus","Homo sapiens"],"language":"en"}]}

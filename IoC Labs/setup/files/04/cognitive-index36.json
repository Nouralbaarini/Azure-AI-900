Here, we provide an introduction to IFITM3 and the biochemical regulation underlying its antiviral activity. Further, we analyze and summarize the published literature examining phenotypes of IFITM3 knockout mice upon infections with viral pathogens and discuss the controversial association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human IFITM3 gene and severe virus infections. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent publications show that IFITM3 knockout mice experience more severe pathologies than wild-type mice in diverse virus infections, including infections with influenza A virus, West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and cytomegalovirus. Likewise, numerous studies of humans of Chinese ancestry have associated the IFITM3 SNP rs12252-C with severe influenza virus infections, though examinations of other populations, such as Europeans, in which this SNP is rare, have largely failed to identify an association with severe infections. A second SNP, rs34481144-A, found in the human IFITM3 promoter has also recently been reported to be a risk allele for severe influenza virus infections. SUMMARY: There is significant evidence for a protective role of IFITM3 against virus infections in both mice and humans, though additional work is required to identify the range of pathogens restricted by IFITM3 and the mechanisms by which human SNPs affect IFITM3 levels or functionality.","publish_time":"2018-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zani, Ashley; Yount, Jacob S.","journal":"Curr Clin Microbiol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/069d6ce905dc7992f5bc8692218ca3969ab3e227.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6334760.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30662816/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40588-018-0103-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe virus infections","severe influenza virus infections","diverse virus infections","severe infections","Chikungunya virus","IFITM3 levels","human IFITM3 gene","human IFITM3 promoter","respiratory syncytial virus","West Nile virus","IFITM3 knockout mice experience","phenotypes of IFITM3 knockout mice","protective role of IFITM3","IFITM3 SNP rs12252-C","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus","severe pathologies","human SNPs","wild-type mice","Recent publications","viral pathogens","controversial association","RECENT FINDINGS","range of pathogens","numerous studies of humans","Chinese ancestry","fusion","single nucleotide polymorphisms","biochemical regulation","mechanisms","examinations","risk allele","cellular restriction factor","significant evidence","published literature","Interferon","transmembrane protein","functionality","additional work","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","antiviral activity","populations","introduction","host membranes","cytomegalovirus","SUMMARY","Europeans","rs34481144"],"language":"en"},

Summary The almost pandemic spread of cannabis among adolescents and young adults, especially in France, justifies the attention given to the consequences, not only acute but also delayed, of this intoxication. In the latter case, epigenetic mechanisms occur. We will first recall various types of epigenetic modifications involving either chromatin histones, mainly methylations or acetylations; either DNA, by methylation of cytosines. Such modifications caused by the tetrahydrocannabinol/THC of cannabis can intervene: either at the level of gametes before procreation, or at different points of the life cycle. These epigenetic modifications are associated with an increase in vulnerability to drug addiction, involving dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, overexpression of enkephalin precursor synthesis, modifications of: CB1 receptors of endocannabinoids, glutamic acid receptors, GABA receptors, proteins involved in synaptic plasticity ... These changes can also affect: immune system, cognitive activities, development of psychiatric diseases, related to disturbances of brain maturation. The knowledge that accumulates in this respect is the opposite of the ambient trivialization of this drug. They impose sending an alert to the public authorities and to the public, especially young people, warning on the risks associated with this drug use and abuse.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costentin, J.","journal":"Bull Acad Natl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cfbefdd11a70cbacd9a0d984206df7c977f8ae8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407920301758?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407920301758","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["GABA"],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["the tetrahydrocannabinol","the attention given to the consequences","the ambient trivialization","either at the level","These epigenetic modifications","The knowledge that accumulates in this respect is the opposite","the risks associated with this drug","involving dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens","sending an alert to the public authorities","Such modifications caused","Summary The almost pandemic spread","abord diff\u00E9rents types de modifications \u00E9pig\u00E9n\u00E9tiques","especially in France","epigenetic modifications involving either chromatin histones","GABA receptors","CB1 receptors","this intoxication","cannabis can intervene","cannabis among adolescents","associated with an increase in vulnerability to drug addiction","r\u00E9cepteurs D2","r\u00E9cepteurs CB1","m\u00E9canismes \u00E9pig\u00E9n\u00E9tiques","related to disturbances","proteins involved in synaptic plasticity","either DNA","glutamic acid receptors","THC","especially young people","epigenetic mechanisms occur","These changes can also affect","young adults","noyau accumbens","attention port\u00E9e","histones de la chromatine","brain maturation","adultes jeunes","m\u00E9thylation des cytosines","at different points","perturbations de la maturation c\u00E9r\u00E9brale","diff\u00E9rents moments de la vie","mainly methylations or acetylations","only acute but also delayed","We will first recall various types","warning","overexpression","gametes before procreation","psychiatric diseases","development","enkephalin precursor synthesis","endocannabinoids","cognitive activities","activit\u00E9s cognitives","affections psychiatriques","d\u00E9veloppement","relation","plasticit\u00E9 synaptique","They","endocannabino\u00EFdes","case","prot\u00E9ines impliqu\u00E9es","accroissement de la vuln\u00E9rabilit\u00E9","mode quasi pand\u00E9mique","surexpression de la synth\u00E8se","acide glutamique","toxicomanies","t\u00E9trahydrocannabinol","pr\u00E9curseur des enk\u00E9phalines","type suscit\u00E9es","cycle","syst\u00E8me immunitaire","risques associ\u00E9es","procr\u00E9ation","consommation","diffusion","ADN","gestation","cons\u00E9quences","derni\u00E8re \u00E9ventualit\u00E9","banalisation ambiante","niveau des gam\u00E8tes","m\u00E9thylations","ac\u00E9tylations","\u00E9gard","f\u0153tus","drogue","individu","pouvoirs publics","connaissances"],"language":"fr"},

NNPDS is a diarrhoeic syndrome affecting piglets within the first week of life, which is not caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type A/C, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), rotavirus A, coronavirus, Cystoisospora suis, Strongyloides ransomi, Giardia spp or Cryptosporidium spp. RESULTS: Piglets were estimated to have a negative ADG of 9 and 14 g when diarrhoeic for 1 day and \u003E1 day respectively. However, if only diarrhoeic on the day of birth, no negative effect on ADG was seen. Piglets originating from severely affected litters were estimated to have a reduced ADG of 38 g. The study did not show an overall effect of diarrhoea on mortality, but herd of origin, sow parity, birth weight, and gender were significantly associated with mortality. In one of the herds, approximately 25% of the diarrhoeic piglets vs. 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets died, and 74% of necropsied piglets were diagnosed with enteritis. These findings indicate that the high mortality seen in this herd was due to diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: NNPDS negatively affected ADG in piglets, and even piglets that were diarrhoeic for one day only experienced a reduction in ADG. However, the study showed that diarrhoea restricted to the day of birth did not affect ADG and suggested this phenomenon to be unrelated to the syndrome. Since the diarrhoeal status of the litter had important effects on ADG, future research on NNPDS probably ought to focus on piglets from severely affected litters. The study showed important dissimilarities in the course of diarrhoea between the herds, and one herd was considerably more affected than the others. Within this herd, NNPDS seemed to be associated with a higher mortality, whereas in general the study did not show lethal effects of NNPDS.","publish_time":"2014-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kongsted, Hanne; Stege, Helle; Toft, Nils; Nielsen, Jens P","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2b354fb613a71ab7f449318fe0d8c20d535e9b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3999350.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755093/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-90","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli","Cystoisospora"],"organizations":["ADG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-diarrhoeic piglets","negative ADG","study","necropsied piglets","diarrhoeic syndrome","reduced ADG","day of birth","overall effect of diarrhoea","course of diarrhoea","lethal effects of NNPDS","high mortality","higher mortality","herds","affected litters","effect of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome","negative effect","herd of origin","Clostridium difficile","important effects","Clostridium perfringens","birth weight","important dissimilarities","Strongyloides ransomi","Giardia spp","Cystoisospora suis","coronavirus","Cryptosporidium","type","sow parity","average daily gain","ETEC","rotavirus","future research","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","RESULTS","gender","diarrhoeal status","clinical manifestations","phenomenon","week of life","findings","enteritis","BACKGROUND","reduction","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to investigate the performance of surgical masks (SMs), which are routinely used in ORs, more efficient N95 surgical mask respirator (SMRs) and N100 filtering facepiece respirator (FFRs), against surgical smoke. METHODS: Ten subjects were recruited to perform surgical dissections on animal tissue in a simulated OR chamber, using a standard electrocautery device, generating surgical smoke. Six respiratory protective devices (RPDs) were tested: two SMs, two SMRs, and two N100 FFRs [including a newly developed faceseal (FS) prototype]. Fit testing was conducted before the experiment. Each subject was then exposed to the surgical smoke while wearing an RPD under the tests. Concentrations inside (C(in)) and outside (C(out)) of the RPD were measured by a particle size spectrometer. The simulated workplace protection factor (SWPF) was determined by the ratio of C(out) and C(in) for each RPD-wearing subject. RESULTS: For the SMs, the geometric means of SWPF(total) (based on the total aerosol concentration) were 1.49 and 1.76, indicating minimal protection. The SWPF(total) values of the SMRs and N100 FFRs were significantly higher than those of the SMs: for the two SMRs, the SWPF(total) were 208 and 263; for the two N100s, the SWPF(total) values were 1,089 and 2,199. No significant difference was observed between either the two SMs or the two SMRs. The SWPF(total) for the novel FS prototype N100 FFR was significantly higher than the conventional N100 FFR. The correlation between SWPF(total) and fit factor (FF) determined for two N95 SMRs was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: SMs do not provide measurable protection against surgical smoke. SMRs offer considerably improved protection versus SMs, while the N100 FFRs showed significant improvement over the SMRs. The FS prototype offered a higher level of protection than the standard N100 FFR, due to a tighter seal. While we acknowledge that conventional N100 FFRs (equipped with exhalation valves) are not practical for human OR use, the results obtained with the FS prototype demonstrate the potential of the new FS technology for implementation on various types of respirators.","publish_time":"2016-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Shuang; Koehler, Richard H.; Yermakov, Michael; Grinshpun, Sergey A.","journal":"Ann Occup Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d934fd82446990b7be622f8be1c9a505b47f0b56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109898.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/annhyg/mew006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26929204/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPD","SWPF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SMs","Surgical smoke","conventional N100 FFRs","N95 SMRs","surgical dissections","standard N100 FFR","novel FS prototype N100 FFR","performance of surgical masks","N100 filtering facepiece respirator","higher level of protection","measurable protection","improved protection","geometric means of SWPF","minimal protection","total aerosol concentration","efficient N95 surgical mask respirator","simulated workplace protection factor","ratio of C","new FS technology","fit factor","values","significant improvement","RESULTS","significant difference","OBJECTIVE","standard electrocautery device","Fit testing","implementation","chamber","toxins","animal tissue","exhalation valves","potential","various types of respirators","adverse health effects","developed faceseal","room","RPDs","respiratory protective devices","use","subjects","particle size spectrometer","tighter seal","experiment","study","CONCLUSIONS","N100s","correlation","METHODS","personnel","tests","Concentrations"],"language":"en"},

Positive percent agreement (sensitivity), negative percent agreement (specificity), and overall percent agreement of the rapid immunochromatography test compared with testing by real-time PCR were 90.2%, 100%, and 95.9%, respectively. In addition, the rapid immunochromatography test was completed within 20min. The SD Bioline Norovirus test was, therefore, easier and more rapid to perform and showed excellent reproducibility, no cross-reactivity, no interference, and high agreement compared with real-time PCR. Thus, this test is useful for rapid screening to identity norovirus infection.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyun Soo; Hyun, Jeongwon; Kim, Jae-Seok; Song, Wonkeun; Kang, Hee Jung; Lee, Kyu Man","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119779.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093412002935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22960089/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093412002935; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.08.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SD Bioline Norovirus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reproducibility test","norovirus-negative samples","new rapid immunochromatography test","SD Bioline Norovirus test","norovirus-positive stool samples","norovirus genome","rapid screening","negative percent agreement","detection of human norovirus","Positive percent agreement","identity norovirus infection","cross-reactivity","negative results","positive results","interference","overall percent agreement","high agreement","excellent reproducibility","different real-time PCR kits","concentration","copies","analytical performance studies","detection limit","clinical performance","specificity","sensitivity","testing","fecal specimens","equivalent","comparison","repeatability","addition"],"language":"en"},

The success or failure of vector control rests mainly on the nature and scale of the behavioural response of exposed populations. Large-scale adoption of recommended protective behaviour represents a critical challenge that cannot be addressed without a better understanding of how individuals perceive and react to the risk of infection. Recently, French overseas territories faced large-scale outbreaks: an epidemic of chikungunya fever in La Re\u2032 union and Mayotte (2005\u20132006) and four successive outbreaks of dengue fever in one Caribbean island, Martinique (1995\u20132007). To assess how these populations perceived and responded to the risk, and how the nature and scale of protection affected their clinical status, socio-epidemiological surveys were conducted on each island during the outbreaks. These surveys address three crucial and interconnected questions relevant to the period after persons infected by the virus were identified: which factors shape the risk of acquiring disease? Which socio- demographic characteristics and living conditions induce a higher likelihood of infection? What is the impact of risk perception on protective behaviours adopted against mosquito bites? Grounded on the results of these surveys, a general framework is proposed to help draw out the knowledge needed to reveal the factors associated with higher probability of infection as an outbreak emerges. The lessons learnt can inform health authorities\u2019 efforts to improve risk communication programmes, both in terms of the target and content of messages, so as to explore new strategies for ensuring sustainable protective behaviour. The authors compare three epidemics of vector-borne diseases to elucidate psychosocial factors that determine how populations perceive and respond to the risk of infectious disease.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Setbon, M; Raude, J","journal":"Emerg Health Threats J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5c6a1c48730f12db7c74e51ca05a54fb4a9d202.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3167643.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22460287/; https://doi.org/10.3134/ehtj.09.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mayotte","Martinique"],"keyphrases":["risk of infection","risk of infectious disease","risk of acquiring disease","risk communication programmes","impact of risk perception","large-scale outbreaks","protective behaviours","sustainable protective behaviour","nature","successive outbreaks of dengue fever","socio-epidemiological surveys","psychosocial factors","epidemics of vector","higher probability of infection","infectious diseases","higher likelihood of infection","Large-scale adoption of recommended protective behaviour","epidemic of chikungunya fever","scale of protection","failure of vector control rests","Caribbean island","behavioural response of exposed populations","health authorities\u2019 efforts","socio- demographic characteristics","major global human health threats","conditions","clinical status","interconnected questions relevant","period","terms","West Nile fevers","new strategies","French overseas territories","persons","critical challenge","malaria","developed countries","mosquito bites","target","content of messages","lessons","virus","union","Martinique","individuals","general framework","better understanding","results","authors","Mayotte","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of codon usage patterns would contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms and genetic architecture of H. manillensis, which in turn would provide insight into the characteristics of other leeches. We analysed codon usage and related indices using 18,000 coding sequences (CDSs) retrieved from H. manillensis RNA-Seq data. RESULTS: We identified four highly preferred codons in H. manillensis that have G/C-endings. Points generated in an effective number of codons (ENC) plot distributed below the standard curve and the slope of a neutrality plot was less than 1. Highly expressed CDSs had lower ENC content and higher GC content than weakly expressed CDSs. Principal component analysis conducted on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values divided CDSs according to GC content and divided codons according to ending bases. Moreover, by determining codon usage, we found that the majority of blood-diet related genes have undergone less adaptive evolution in H. manillensis, except for those with homologous sequences in the host species. CONCLUSIONS: Codon usage in H. manillensis had an overall preference toward C-endings and indicated that codon usage patterns are mediated by differential expression, GC content, and biological function. Although mutation pressure effects were also notable, the majority of genetic evolution in H. manillensis was driven by natural selection.

They are considered highly sensitive and specific compared to conventional techniques. In this study two nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) were compared to conventional methods (immunofluorescence and viral culture). The aim of this work was to discuss the clinical interpretation of the results obtained by NAATs on the basis of the two\u2010decade experience of our group and the literature. Eighty nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children under six years attended for acute respiratory illness at the pediatric emergency room of a third level Hospital. Both NAATs tested (Seeplex(\u00AE) and Clart(\u00AE)) showed an overall higher performance regarding sensitivity (76% and 90%, respectively). Compared to Seeplex(\u00AE), the Clart(\u00AE) system tripled the number of multiple detections (8 by Seeplex(\u00AE) vs. 25 by Clart(\u00AE)). In some specimens both NAATs detected different viruses. Given these discrepancies and the fact that detection of viral nucleic acids is not necessarily related to the current clinical syndrome, the interpretation of molecular results may not always be so straightforward. The pros and cons of NAATs should always be taken into account when giving a result. J. Med.

Non-immune PBL were found to limit virus replication at an effector-to-target ratio of 100/1 even when effector cells were depleted of phagocytic cells. Neutralizing anti-IFN antibodies did not abrogate the effect. PBL from newborn animals were as effective as adult cells, whereas fibroepithelial cells, human and mouse lymphoid cells did not exert antiviral effects. Under similar conditions, PBL from adult animals could lyse TGEV-infected cells even in the presence of anti-IFN antibodies. However, newborn PBL were not cytotoxic. Moreover, depletion of NK cells by monoclonal antibodies plus complement did not alter the inhibitory effect. These latter observations suggest that virus multiplication-inhibition effects and cytotoxic (or NK) activities are unrelated.","publish_time":"1987-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Charley, B.; Laude, H.; La Bonnardi\u00E8re, C.","journal":"Annales de l\u0027Institut Pasteur / Virologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67c9915e9aaaeed5cdfb8164a0bf9dbbb881722d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0769-2617(87)80003-5; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0769261787800035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0769261787800035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adult cells","effector cells","fibroepithelial cells","phagocytic cells","TGEV-infected cells","depletion of NK cells","TGEV-infected epithelial cells","newborn PBL","mouse lymphoid cells","Non-immune PBL","presence of anti-IFN antibodies","adult animals","virus multiplication-inhibition effects","antiviral effects","newborn animals","virus replication","monoclonal antibodies","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","effects of non-immune porcine peripheral blood leukocytes","inhibitory effect","viral antigens","cell surface","complement","Coronavirus infection","low amounts of interferon","similar conditions","target ratio","observations","activities","assay","studies","Summary"],"language":"en"},

Guided by APSED, Mongolia has established a functional coordination mechanism between the animal and human health sectors. Surveillance, information exchange and risk assessment, risk reduction, and coordinated response capacity and collaborative research have been identified as the four pillars of the zoonoses framework. Intersectoral collaboration has been clearly shown to be a crucial tool in the prevention and control of emerging zoonotic diseases. A \u201COne Health\u201D strategy has been implemented under the concept of \u2018Healthy animal-Healthy food-Healthy people\u2019. An intersectoral coordination mechanism established between the veterinary and public health sectors has expanded its function to incorporate more work on food safety, emergency management, and effects of climate change on zoonotic diseases. Its membership includes the human health sector, the veterinary sector, the national emergency management agency, the environment sector, emergency management and inspection authorities, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The main outputs of the coordination mechanism have been strengthened surveillance and response activities and laboratory capacities. The coordination mechanism has also strengthened the surveillance and response capacity of neglected zoonotic diseases, such as brucellosis, anthrax, and tick-borne diseases. Through regular meetings and brainstorming sessions, both sectors have developed joint operational plans, a long-term risk reduction plan 2011\u20132015, initiated a prioritization exercise and risk assessment for 29 zoonotic diseases, and reviewed and revised standards, procedures, and communication strategies. In 2011, a list of experts on major zoonoses were identified from different sectors and formed into a taskforce to identify the focal points for rabies, brucellosis, and vector-borne diseases. As a result, disease control strategies are now linked to scientific research and epidemiological expertise.","publish_time":"2012-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Batsukh, Zayat; Tsolmon, B.; Otgonbaatar, Dashdavaa; Undraa, Baatar; Dolgorkhand, Adyadorj; Ariuntuya, Ochirpurev","journal":"One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2b7d7ad15ea8af1ac592714a0b69ff16f99e61e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122222.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23065105/; https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2012_253","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Mongolia"],"keyphrases":["Emerging Diseases","control of emerging zoonotic diseases","different sectors","human health sectors","tick-borne diseases","public health sectors","response capacity of neglected zoonotic diseases","intersectoral coordination mechanism","risk assessment","Surveillance","functional coordination mechanism","veterinary sector","Healthy animal-Healthy food-Healthy people","World Health Organization","different aspects of emerging disease","environment sector","national emergency management agency","long-term risk reduction plan","coordinated response capacity","brucellosis","response activities","different actors","disease control strategies","APSED","Intersectoral collaboration","food safety","scientific research","communication strategies","collaborative research","major zoonoses","zoonoses framework","Asia Pacific Strategy","inspection authorities","joint operational plans","prevention","effects of climate change","information exchange","revised standards","brainstorming sessions","rabies","focal points","procedures","partnership","laboratory capacities","taskforce","Mongolia","concept","anthrax","regular meetings","prioritization exercise","list of experts","epidemiological expertise","crucial tool","consensus","result","vector","main outputs","membership","pillars"],"language":"en"},

Over the past several years, significant improvements in DNA sequencing, including consensus sequence analysis, have proven invaluable for high-throughput studies. However, all current DNA sequencing platforms have limited utility for studies of complex mixtures or of individual long molecules, the latter of which is crucial to understanding evolution and consequences of single nucleotide variants and their combinations. Here we report a new technology termed LUCS (Long-molecule UMI-driven Consensus Sequencing), in which reads from third-generation sequencing are aggregated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) specific for each individual DNA molecule. This enables in-silico reconstruction of highly accurate consensus reads of each DNA molecule independent of other molecules in the sample. Additionally, use of two UMIs enables detection of artificial recombinants (chimeras). As proof of concept, we show that application of LUCS to assessment of mitochondrial genomes in complex mixtures from single cells was associated with an error rate of 1X10(-4) errors/nucleotide. Thus, LUCS represents a major step forward in DNA sequencing that offers high-throughput capacity and high-accuracy reads in studies of long DNA templates and nucleotide variants in heterogenous samples.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Annis, Sofia; Fleischmann, Zo\u00EB; Logan, Robert; Mullin-Bernstein, Zachary; Franco, Melissa; Sa\u00FCrich, Josefin; Tilly, Jonathan L.; Woods, Dori C.; Khrapko, Konstantin","journal":"Aging (Albany NY)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3e287fee5b0f32d1c3587dfcd1a752a6c09bd2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202536.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LUCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mitochondrial DNA","individual DNA molecule","DNA molecule independent","current DNA sequencing platforms","studies of long DNA templates","generation sequencing","high-throughput studies","molecule UMI-driven Consensus Sequencing","studies of complex mixtures","individual long molecules","consensus sequence analysis","accurate consensus","consequences of single nucleotide variants","high-accuracy","high-throughput capacity","UMIs","application of LUCS","single cells","viral evolution","assessment of mitochondrial genomes","Nucleic acid sequence analyses","utility","aging","aspects of biological research","unique molecular identifiers","significant improvements","years","heterogenous samples","detection of artificial recombinants","cancer","mtDNA","major step","error rate of 1X10","chimeras","past","silico reconstruction","combinations","new technology","errors","proof of concept"],"language":"en"},

These viral proteins, collectively named viroporins, are crucial for viral pathogenicity. In the past five years, structures obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography, and electron microscopy (EM) showed that viroporins often adopt minimalist architectures to achieve their functions. A number of small molecules have been identified to interfere with their channel activities and thereby inhibit viral infection, making viroporins potential drug targets for therapeutic intervention. The known architectures and inhibition mechanisms of viroporins differ significantly from each other, but some common principles are shared between them.

DESIGN: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. DATA EXTRACTION: At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). RESULTS: 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. CONCLUSION: Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

The objective of this study was to detect the presence of novel signatures that may serve as early warning indicators of the conversion of LPAI viruses to high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. This study included three H5N2 and one H5N3 viruses that were isolated from live poultry imported into Singapore as part of the national avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance program. Based on the molecular criterion of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), sequence analysis with the translated amino acid (aa) sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed the absence of multibasic aa at the HA cleavage site, identifying all four virus isolates as LPAI. Detailed phylogenetic tree analyses using the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes clustered these isolates in the Eurasian H5 lineage, but away from the HPAI H5 subtypes. This analysis further revealed that the internal genes clustered to different avian and swine subtypes, suggesting that the four isolates may possibly share their ancestry with these different influenza subtypes. Our results suggest that the four LPAI isolates in this study contained mainly avian signatures, and the phylogenetic tree for the internal genes further suggests the potential for reassortment with other different circulating avian subtypes. This is the first comprehensive report on the genetic characterization of LPAI H5N2/3 viruses isolated in South-East Asia.","publish_time":"2009-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yeo, Dawn Su-Yin; Ng, Sock-Hoon; Liaw, Chin-Wen; Ng, Ley-Moy; Wee, Eugene Jing-Hui; Lim, Elizabeth Ai-Sim; Seah, Shirely Lay-Kheng; Wong, Wai-Kwan; Lim, Chee-Wee; Sugrue, Richard J.; Tan, Boon-Huan","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c103d4a5653649f6940c918b784617148e66be3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125998.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.04.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509002041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19464126/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509002041","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LPAI","HPAI"],"locations":["Singapore","South-East Asia"],"keyphrases":["LPAI isolates","avian signatures","conversion of LPAI viruses","different influenza subtypes","different circulating avian subtypes","high pathogenic avian influenza","low pathogenic avian influenza","national avian influenza virus","H5N3 viruses","virus isolates","study","genetic characterization of LPAI H5N2","HPAI H5 subtypes","internal genes","swine subtypes","sequence analysis","HA cleavage site","gene segments","Detailed phylogenetic tree analyses","absence of multibasic aa","presence of novel signatures","Eurasian H5 lineage","World Organisation","Animal Health","OIE","translated amino acid","AIV","reassortment","early warning indicators","neuraminidase","potential","surveillance program","Singapore","hemagglutinin","ancestry","molecular criterion","live poultry","comprehensive report","South-East Asia","results","objective"],"language":"en"},

Content Analysis of Tweets, Other Social Media, and Online Newspapers During the Measles Outbreak in the Netherlands in 2013","doi":"10.2196/jmir.3863","pmcid":"PMC4468573","pubmed_id":"26013683","license":"cc-by","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In May 2013, a measles outbreak began in the Netherlands among Orthodox Protestants who often refuse vaccination for religious reasons. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the number of messages expressed on Twitter and other social media during the measles outbreak with the number of online news articles and the number of reported measles cases to answer the question if and when social media reflect public opinion patterns versus disease patterns. METHODS: We analyzed measles-related tweets, other social media messages, and online newspaper articles over a 7-month period (April 15 to November 11, 2013) with regard to topic and sentiment. Thematic analysis was used to structure and analyze the topics. RESULTS: There was a stronger correlation between the weekly number of social media messages and the weekly number of online news articles (P\u003C.001 for both tweets and other social media messages) than between the weekly number of social media messages and the weekly number of reported measles cases (P=.003 and P=.048 for tweets and other social media messages, respectively), especially after the summer break. All data sources showed 3 large peaks, possibly triggered by announcements about the measles outbreak by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and statements made by well-known politicians. Most messages informed the public about the measles outbreak (ie, about the number of measles cases) (93/165, 56.4%) followed by messages about preventive measures taken to control the measles spread (47/132, 35.6%). The leading opinion expressed was frustration regarding people who do not vaccinate because of religious reasons (42/88, 48%). CONCLUSIONS: The monitoring of online (social) media might be useful for improving communication policies aiming to preserve vaccination acceptability among the general public. Data extracted from online (social) media provide insight into the opinions that are at a certain moment salient among the public, which enables public health institutes to respond immediately and appropriately to those public concerns. More research is required to develop an automatic coding system that captures content and user\u2019s characteristics that are most relevant to the diseases within the National Immunization Program and related public health events and can inform official responses.","publish_time":"2015-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mollema, Liesbeth; Harmsen, Irene Anhai; Broekhuizen, Emma; Clijnk, Rutger; De Melker, Hester; Paulussen, Theo; Kok, Gerjo; Ruiter, Robert; Das, Enny","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4468573.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26013683/; https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.3863","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Immunization Program"],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["number of messages","weekly number of social media messages","number of measles cases","measles outbreak","weekly number of reported measles cases","measles-related tweets","general public","public concerns","weekly number of online news articles","public health institutes","public opinion patterns","related public health events","online newspaper articles","religious reasons","disease patterns","vaccination acceptability","leading opinion","data sources","National Immunization Program","Dutch National Institute","Environment","content","statements","question","user\u2019s characteristics","communication policies","automatic coding system","stronger correlation","large peaks","diseases","people","Orthodox Protestants","opinions","announcements","Netherlands","certain moment salient","Twitter","official responses","well-known politicians","frustration","preventive measures","monitoring","insight","month period","regard","sentiment","RESULTS","aim","METHODS","Thematic analysis","summer break","OBJECTIVE","research","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","topics"],"language":"en"},

The pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitor reveals a pronounced lung tropism and suitability for administration by the inhalative route.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Linlin; Lin, Daizong; Sun, Xinyuanyuan; Curth, Ute; Drosten, Christian; Sauerhering, Lucie; Becker, Stephan; Rox, Katharina; Hilgenfeld, Rolf","journal":"Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/195a96bf047413d53b4c5a19cb22af30d6e37baa.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f325bf02a0ab98616b20f256a802b190fea1bdb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164518.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb3405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32198291/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimized inhibitor","potent inhibitor","designed inhibitor","unliganded SARS-CoV","\u03B1-ketoamide inhibitor","lead compound","suitability","administration","pronounced lung tropism","coronaviruses","P3-P2 amide bond","pyridone ring","main protease","attractive drug target","half-life","complex","X-ray structures","polyproteins","inhalative route","pharmacokinetic characterization","pandemic","global health emergency","essential role","plasma","COVID","viral RNA"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, we have hypothesized that germline antibodies may not bind to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) because they are so different compared to the highly somatically mutated HIV-1-specific bnAbs. We have further hypothesized that the immunogenicity of highly conserved epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) may be reduced or eliminated by their very weak or absent interactions with germline antibodies and immune responses leading to the elicitation of bnAbs may not be initiated and/or sustained. Even if such responses are initiated, the maturation pathways are so extraordinarily complex that prolonged periods of time may be required for elicitation of bnAbs with defined unique sequences. We provided the initial evidence supporting this antibody germline/maturation hypothesis, which prompted a number of studies to design vaccine immunogens that could bind putative germline predecessors of known bnAbs and to explore complex B cell lineages. However, guiding the immune system through the exceptionally complex antibody maturation pathways to elicit known bnAbs remains a major challenge.

Simple and rapid immunodiagnostic methods are urgently needed to identify positive cases. Here we report the development of a rapid and sensitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that uses lanthanide-doped polysterene nanoparticles (LNPs) to detect anti-SARV-CoV-2 IgG in human serum. A recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was dispensed onto a nitrocellulose membrane to capture specific IgG. Mouse anti-human IgG antibody was labeled with self-assembled LNPs that served as a fluorescent reporter. A 100-\u03BCL aliquot of serum samples (1:1000 dilution) was used for this assay and the whole detection process took 10 min. The results of the validation experiment met the requirements for clinical diagnostic reagents. A value of 0.0666 was defined as the cutoff value by assaying 51 normal samples. We tested 7 samples that were positive by reverse-transcription (RT-)PCR and 12 that were negative but clinically suspicious for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. One of the negative samples was determined to be SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, while the results for the other samples were consistent with those obtained by RT-PCR. Thus, this assay can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum and allow positive identification in suspicious cases; it can also be useful for monitoring the progression COVID-19 and evaluating patients\u2019 response to treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Zhenhua; Zhang, Zhigao; Zhai, Xiangming; Li, Yongyin; Lin, Li; Zhao, Hui; Bian, Lun; Li, Peng; Yu, Lei; Wu, Yingsong; Lin, Guanfeng","journal":"Anal Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d3fe219bedad7f30f71dd8f15e9c34c9df16f56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202245.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32323974/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c00784","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IgG positive","presence of anti-SARS-CoV","negative samples","sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV","anti-SARV-CoV","specific IgG","normal samples","Mouse anti-human IgG antibody","human serum","positive cases","\u03BCL aliquot of serum samples","huge number of samples","positive identification","recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS","results","suspicious cases","RT-PCR","rapid immunodiagnostic methods","coronavirus disease","detection process","progression COVID","cutoff value","self-assembled LNPs","sensitive lateral flow immunoassay","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","causative pathogen","LFIA","requirements","lanthanide-doped polysterene nanoparticles","outbreak","validation experiment","hospital laboratories","clinical diagnostic reagents","reverse-transcription","patients\u2019 response","challenge","text","nitrocellulose membrane","development","dilution","fluorescent reporter","treatment","Image"],"language":"en"},

Early identification of patients at an increasing risk of death may avert adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to establish an early prediction model of fatal adverse prognosis of fever patients by extracting key indicators using big data technology. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients\u2019 data was conducted using the Emergency Rescue Database of Chinese People\u0027s Liberation Army General Hospital. Patients were divided into the fatal adverse prognosis group and the good prognosis group. The commonly used clinical indicators were compared. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was used to determine the optimal number of the included variables. In the training model, logistic regression, random forest, adaboost and bagging were selected. We also collected the emergency room data from December 2018 to December 2019 with the same inclusion and exclusion criterion. The performance of the model was evaluated by accuracy, F1-score, precision, sensitivity and the areas under receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC-AUC). RESULTS: The accuracy of logistic regression, decision tree, adaboost and bagging was 0.951, 0.928, 0.924, and 0.924, F1-scores were 0.938, 0.933, 0.930, and 0.930, the precision was 0.943, 0.938, 0.937, and 0.937, ROC-AUC were 0.808, 0.738, 0.736, and 0.885, respectively. ROC-AUC of ten-fold cross-validation in logistic and bagging models were 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. The top six coefficients and odds ratio (OR) values of the variables in the Logistic regression were cardiac troponin T (CTnT) (coefficient=0.346, OR = 1.413), temperature (T) (coefficient=0.235, OR = 1.265), respiratory rate (RR) (coefficient= \u20130.206,OR = 0.814), serum kalium (K) (coefficient=0.137, OR = 1.146), pulse oxygen saturation (SPO(2)) (coefficient= \u20130.101, OR = 0.904), and albumin (ALB) (coefficient= \u20130.043, OR = 0.958). The weights of the top six variables in the bagging model were: CTnT, RR, lactate dehydrogenase, serum amylase, heartrate, and systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The main clinical indicators of concern included CTnT, RR, SPO(2), T, ALB and K. The bagging model and logistic regression model had better diagnostic performance comprehesively. Those may be conducive to the early identification of critical patients with fever by physicians.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Chun-Hong; Wu, Hui-Tao; Che, He-Bin; Song, Ya-Nan; Zhao, Yu-Zhuo; Li, Kai-Yuan; Xiao, Hong-Ju; Zhai, Yong-Zhi; Liu, Xin; Lu, Hong-Xi; Li, Tan-Shi","journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40f8166324b40954ba214d2108ef51b0fb7d756f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7065855.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000000675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32044816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recursive"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["logistic regression model","accuracy of logistic regression","training model","Early identification of patients","early prediction model of fatal adverse prognosis of fever patients","CTnT","RR","bagging models","ROC-AUC","early identification of critical patients","fatal adverse prognosis group","included variables","emergency room data","common chief complaint of emergency patients","good prognosis group","key indicators","adverse outcomes","SPO","precision","main clinical indicators of concern","retrospective study of patients\u2019 data","cardiac troponin T","big data technology","serum amylase","serum kalium","diagnostic performance","F1-scores","Emergency Rescue Database of Chinese People\u0027s Liberation Army General Hospital","heartrate","receiver operator characteristic curves","areas","sensitivity","lactate dehydrogenase","increasing risk of death","random forest","fold cross-validation","decision tree","Recursive feature elimination","RFE","systolic blood pressure","values","optimal number","odds ratio","pulse oxygen saturation","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","physicians","respiratory rate","RESULTS","inclusion","exclusion criterion","coefficients","BACKGROUND","albumin","temperature","aim","weights"],"language":"en"},

Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1,300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9,900 proteins conserved across mammals. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins from the cellular functions they hijack and that (ii) despite this high constraint, virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. Our results demonstrate that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.","publish_time":"2015-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enard, David; Cai, Le; Gwenapp, Carina; Petrov, Dmitri A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01e3b313e78a352593be2ff64927192af66619b5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c895bcdd870324d7bf652d518ae98637ce87ffdb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/029397","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteins account","thousands of proteins","constrained proteins","Viruses","specialized antiviral proteins","broad array of proteins","mammals","protein adaptation","non-immune functions","high proportion","high constraint","cellular functions","antiviral defense","mammalian","dominant drivers of evolutionary change","human proteomes","humans","functional categories","hundreds","set","results"],"language":"en"},

Physicians will have critical roles in diagnosis, containment and treatment of influenza, and their commitment to treat despite increased personal risks is essential for a successful public health response. The obligations of the medical profession stem from the unique skills of its practitioners, who are able to provide more effective aid than the general public in a medical emergency. The free choice of profession and the societal contract from which doctors derive substantial benefits affirm this commitment. In hospitals, the duty will fall upon specialties that are most qualified to deal with an influenza pandemic, such as critical care, pulmonology, anesthesiology and emergency medicine. It is unrealistic to expect that this obligation to treat should be burdened with unlimited risks. Instead, risks should be minimized and justified against the effectiveness of interventions. Institutional and public cooperation in logistics, remuneration and psychological/legal support may help remove the barriers to the ability to treat.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We obtained monthly patterns of KD from the seventh nationwide survey and viral detection data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2011 and evaluated temporal correlations between them for each month. The respiratory viruses detected using a multiplex real-time-polymerase chain reaction kit were influenza virus (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1, and B), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (type 1, 2, 3), respiratory syncytial virus (type A, B), human rhinovirus, human coronavirus (OC43/229E, NL63), human bocavirus, and enterovirus. RESULTS: We obtained data from a total of 13031 patients who were treated for acute KD from 87 hospitals with pediatric residence programs. During this survey, KD showed highest overall incidence in summer and winter seasons and lowest incidence in February and October. We received viral detection data for a total of 14267 patients. Viral detection was highest during winter and spring seasons. The most commonly detected virus was human rhinovirus (32.6%), followed by influenza virus (26.8%). The monthly incidence of KD showed significant correlation with the monthly overall viral detection (p=0.022, r=0.382). In particular, human bocavirus and enterovirus have significant correlations with monthly patterns of KD occurrence (p=0.032 and p=0.007, respectively) and influenza virus correlated with KD occurrence with borderline significance (p=0.063). CONCLUSION: The temporal association between monthly occurrence of KD and viral detection suggests the etiologic importance of precedent infection in the development of KD.","publish_time":"2014-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Gi Beom; Park, Sohee; Kwon, Bo Sang; Han, Ji Whan; Park, Yong Won; Hong, Young Mi","journal":"Korean Circ J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67a530bb1b7075edffe904df66644b0a1da97d1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4117846.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2014.44.4.250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25089137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monthly occurrence of KD","monthly incidence of KD","monthly patterns of KD occurrence","development of KD","acute KD","viral detection data","monthly overall viral detection","detected virus","human bocavirus","human rhinovirus","parainfluenza virus","human coronavirus","respiratory syncytial virus","various viral infections","temporal correlations","occurrence of Kawasaki disease","highest overall incidence","significant correlations","winter seasons","lowest incidence","type","enterovirus","patients","total","potential temporal associations","Disease Control","nationwide survey","spring seasons","respiratory viruses","summer","polymerase chain reaction kit","Korea Centers","multiplex real-time","OC43","etiologic importance of precedent infection","hospitals","adenovirus","borderline significance","Prevention","study","pediatric residence programs","NL63","H5N1","METHODS","CONCLUSION","H1N1","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES","H3N2","SUBJECTS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Two hundred thirty-eight patients were infected; 33 died. Forty-two percent were health care workers. The whole medical system in the country was put under stress. One major public hospital became the designated SARS hospital. Emergency cases were diverted to the remaining public hospitals, of which Singapore General Hospital was the main recipient. The increase in workload, new infection control procedures including mandatory wearing of the positive airway pressure respirator and personal protective equipment (PPE), and limiting the number of person-contacts with each patient were thought to affect resuscitation and airway management. Our aim is to study the effects of wearing of PPE and the restriction in number of resuscitation personnel on airway management during the SARS crisis. Methods: The emergency department has an ongoing airway registry that prospectively captures patient demographics, diagnosis, indications for intubation, persons and discipline of intubating physician, number of attempts, method of intubation, success rates, and complications. The data were divided into 3 periods: (1) before PPE was instituted from November 1, 2002, to March 31, 2003; (2) during SARS (when PPE use was mandatory) from April 1 to July 31, 2003; and (3) after SARs (when PPE use was nonmandatory but encouraged) from August 1 to December 31, 2003. Results: There was no change in patient demographics during the 3 periods, but there was a change in the patient diagnoses in period 2, with decreases in the proportion of respiratory and cardiac cases and increases in neurology and trauma cases. These changes reverted to the previous distribution in period 3. The alarming discovery was that whereas in period 1 (pre-SARS), resident medical officers attempted intubations 45% of the time, this figure went down to 35% in period 2 (SARS) and 23% in period 3 (post-SARS). Anesthetists performed 1.2%, 8%, and 0% of emergency intubations in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Attending emergency physicians performed 54%, 56%, and 77% of intubations in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The complication/peri-intubation event rates were 10.5%, 9.9%, and 9.4% in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The success rate for residents was 80.8%, 89%, and 86.2% in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Conclusion: The wearing of PPE and positive airway pressure respirator is thought to make intubation more difficult, as seen by the increase in proportion of intubations performed by anesthetists in period 2 and by attending emergency physicians in periods 2 and 3. The infection control policy that restricts the number of health care staff attending to each patient may have influenced the department\u0027s decision to allow only the most confident or experienced personnel to manage the airway. The exposure of junior residents in emergency airway management during SARS and the immediate post-SARS period was decreased. This trend should be further monitored, and intervention may be necessary should it continue to decline.","publish_time":"2004-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, E.; Ho, K.","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064404011059; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064404011059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Singapore General Hospital","PPE"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["periods","pre-SARS","SARS crisis","emergency airway management","immediate post-SARS period","emergency intubations","designated SARS hospital","wearing of PPE","Emergency cases","PPE use","emergency physicians","patient demographics","emergency department","positive airway pressure respirator","ongoing airway registry","patient diagnoses","proportion of intubations","number of resuscitation personnel","number of attempts","method of intubation","mandatory wearing","number of person","number of health care staff","Singapore General Hospital","major public hospital","peri-intubation event rates","proportion of respiratory","success rates","cardiac cases","increase","trauma cases","Anesthetists","infection control policy","health care workers","new infection control procedures","experienced personnel","medical system","Study objectives","remaining public hospitals","resident medical officers","exposure of junior residents","severe acute respiratory syndrome","personal protective equipment","persons","discipline of intubating physician","indications","workload","diagnosis","main recipient","neurology","decreases","restriction","country","percent","previous distribution","complications","contacts","nonmandatory","department\u0027s decision","changes","time","effects","Methods","alarming discovery","Conclusion","patients","intervention","figure","aim","stress","Results","data","trend"],"language":"en"},

The genetic diversity of ALV-J might be related to the env gene, therefore, we selected conserved sequences of the env gene and designed interference sequence. In this study, microRNAs (miRNAs) were designed and synthesized, corresponding to conserved regions of the env gene. These miRNAs were cloned into the linearized eukaryotic expression vector. The recombinant plasmids were transfected into DF-1 cells. After transfection, the cells were inoculated with ALV-J. In reporter assays, the transfection efficiency is 80 % by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). Expression of the virus envelope glycoprotein was measured by IFA and western blotting assays. The relative expression of env gene was determined using quantitative PCR. Our results show that the mi-env 231 and mi-env 1384 could effectively suppress the replication of ALV-J with an efficiency of 68.7\u201375.2 %. These data suggest that the miRNAs targeting the env can inhibit replication of ALV-J efficiently. This finding provides evidence that miRNAs could be used as a potential tool against ALV infection.","publish_time":"2013-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Wei; Zhang, Zai-Ping; Tian, Jin; Xiao, Zhi-Guang; Meng, Qing-Wen","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089131.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-013-0906-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23546824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFA","ALV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ALV-J","mi-env","replication of ALV","miRNAs","relative expression of env gene","ALV infection","genetic diversity of ALV","subgroup J avian leukosis virus","IFA","transfection efficiency","cells","reporter assays","conserved sequences","linearized eukaryotic expression vector","conserved regions","virus envelope glycoprotein","western blotting assays","designed interference sequence","indirect immunofluorescence","potential tool","DF","quantitative PCR","recombinant plasmids","study","microRNAs","results","effective vaccine","data","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Rapid diagnostics is required for clinical decision making regarding isolation of patients and appropriate therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of the Panther Fusion\u00AE respiratory panel using published laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays (LDT). STUDY DESIGN: Analytical sensitivity of Panther Fusion\u00AE Flu A/B/RSV was assessed by testing dilutions of cell culture isolates. Clinical performance assessment included the complete Panther Fusion\u00AE respiratory panel (Flu-A/B/RSV, PIV 1-4 and AdV/hMPV/RV) and consisted of a retrospective and a prospective study-arm. The retrospective evaluation included 201, stored (\u221280 \u00B0C) samples collected between February 2006 and January 2017. Prospective evaluation was performed on 1045 unselected pretreated respiratory tract samples from patients presented to our hospital between November 2017 and May 2018. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity was generally slightly lower for the Panther Fusion\u00AE assays. Clinical specificity and sensitivity was between 96 %\u2013100 % and 71.9 %\u2013100 %, respectively. Discrepant results were found in 146 samples of which 88 samples tested LDT positive / Panther Fusion\u00AE negative and 58 samples were LDT negative / Panther Fusion\u00AE positive. A total of ten discrepant samples with Ct-values \u003C30 were sequenced to confirm the presence of 7 RV-C not-detected by LDT and 1 RV-A and 2 ADV-2 not detected by Panther Fusion\u00AE. CONCLUSIONS: The Panther Fusion\u00AE provides a random-access system with continuous loading and much shorter sample-to-answer times compared to LDT, albeit with a slightly less clinical sensitivity compared to the LDT.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voermans, Jolanda J.C.; Mulders, Daphne G.J.C.; Pas, Suzan D.; Koopmans, Marion P.G.; van der Eijk, Annemiek A.; Molenkamp, Richard","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/506f7699ba70906a607c6d6e704dd077ed97f1f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31869661/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653219302628; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653219302628; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2019.104232","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Analytical sensitivity of Panther Fusion","complete Panther Fusion","clinical sensitivity","LDT negative","discrepant samples","LDT positive","respiratory panel","Clinical specificity","unselected pretreated respiratory tract samples","Respiratory tract infections","clinical performance characteristics","Clinical performance assessment","RV-C","clinical decision making","Flu","STUDY DESIGN","RSV","prospective study-arm","AdV","Discrepant results","Prospective evaluation","retrospective evaluation","isolation of patients","common infections","real-time PCR assays","published laboratory","shorter sample","random-access system","continuous loading","testing dilutions of cell culture isolates","answer times","appropriate therapy","Rapid diagnostics","Ct-values","winter season","PIV","total","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES","aim","presence","hMPV","hospital","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we produced PEDV virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of S, M, and E proteins with a baculovirus expression system and tested them via indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy showed that the morphological structure of the PEDV VLPs was similar to that of the protovirus. Microneutralization assays and ELISpot analysis demonstrated that PEDV VLPs induced highly specific antibody responses and Th2-mediated humoral immunity. As a result, the PEDV VLPs displayed excellent immunogenicity in mice.

We addressed the hypothesis that antigenic drift is involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of SSPE by analyzing antigenic alterations in the MeV envelope hemagglutinin protein (MeV-H) found in patients with SSPE in relation to major circulating MeV genotypes. To this aim, we obtained cDNA for the MeV-H gene from tissue taken at brain autopsy from 3 deceased persons with SSPE who had short (3\u20134 months, SMa79), average (3.5 years, SMa84), and long (18 years, SMa94) disease courses. Recombinant MeVs with a substituted MeV-H gene were generated by a reverse genetic system. Virus neutralization assays with a panel of anti-MeV-H murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or vaccine-immunized mouse anti-MeV-H polyclonal sera were performed to determine the antigenic relatedness. Functional and receptor-binding analysis of the SSPE MeV-H showed activity in a SLAM/nectin-4\u2013dependent manner. Similar to our panel of wild-type viruses, our SSPE viruses showed an altered antigenic profile. Genotypes A, G3, and F (SSPE case SMa79) were the exception, with an intact antigenic structure. Genotypes D7 and F (SSPE SMa79) showed enhanced neutralization by mAbs targeting antigenic site IIa. Genotypes H1 and the recently reported D4.2 were the most antigenically altered genotypes. Epitope mapping of neutralizing mAbs BH015 and BH130 reveal a new antigenic site on MeV-H, which we designated \u03A6 for its intermediate position between previously defined antigenic sites Ia and Ib. We conclude that SSPE-causing viruses show similar antigenic properties to currently circulating MeV genotypes. The absence of a direct correlation between antigenic changes and predisposition of a certain genotype to cause SSPE does not lend support to the proposed antigenic drift as a pathogenetic mechanism in SSPE.","publish_time":"2018-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mu\u00F1oz-Al\u00EDa, Miguel \u00C1ngel; Muller, Claude P.; Russell, Stephen J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7240857da81a0bee7cfb964a7e838f7f1120b46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5821319.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0192245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29466428/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SSPE MeV-H","SSPE viruses","SSPE SMa79","antigenic alterations","antigenic changes","antigenic relatedness","substituted MeV-H gene","pathogenetic mechanism of SSPE","SSPE case SMa79","major circulating MeV genotypes","new antigenic site","proposed antigenic drift","antigenic site IIa","similar antigenic properties","altered antigenic profile","intact antigenic structure","altered genotypes","panel of anti-MeV-H murine monoclonal antibodies","MeV envelope hemagglutinin protein","defined antigenic sites Ia","Genotypes D7","Genotypes H1","vaccine-immunized mouse anti-MeV-H polyclonal sera","type viruses","years","Virus neutralization assays","Epitope mapping of neutralizing mAbs BH015","enhanced neutralization","brain autopsy","panel of wild","particular mutants of measles virus","high levels of neutralizing antibodies","lethal complication of measles","BH130","predisposition","exception","intermediate position","direct correlation","deceased persons","receptor-binding analysis","tissue","activity","patients","certain genotype","nectin","SLAM","average","G3","cDNA","support","Recombinant MeVs","Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis","SMa94","disease courses","reverse genetic system","months","reported D4","absence","dependent manner","SMa84","hypothesis","aim"],"language":"en"},

We have performed a prospective study in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the incidence of respiratory infections, their impact and the epidemiology and outcome in high risk neonates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 2011 to May 2013 a prospective study was conducted in all preterm infants \u003C 32 weeks gestational age and in all term newborns admitted to NICU for any pathology that are anticipated to have an income exceeding two weeks. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected the first day of life and weekly until discharge for virologic study with polymerase chain reaction. When these babies presented respiratory symptoms a new NPA was collected in this moment. A clinical form was filled by the physician. RESULTS: A total of 60 infants were analyzed: 30 (50%) had a gestational age \u003C 32 weeks and 36 (60%) weighing less than 1500 grams. We collected a total of 256 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, 24 of them being positive (9.3%). These 24 positive samples corresponded to 13 infants in our cohort (21.6% of the patients). Of them, 9 were symptomatic and had 11 episodes of infection (2 patients had two different episodes with negative control between them). The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus in (19) 79% of cases. The most frequent clinical data was the presence or increased of apneas (75%) and the needed of oxygenotherapy.

To better define the epidemiology of EV-D68, 6,800 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 2010\u20132014 were subject to EV-D68 detection by RT-PCR and sequencing of 5\u2032UTR and partial VP1. EV-D68 was detected in 30 (0.44%) NPAs from 22 children and 8 adults/elderlies. Sixteen patients (including five elderly) (53%) had pneumonia and 13 (43%) patients were complicated by small airway disease exacerbation. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1, 2C and 3D regions showed four distinct lineages of EV-D68, clade A1, A2, B1 and B3, with adults/elderlies exclusively infected by clade A2. The potentially new clade, B3, has emerged in 2014, while strains closely related to recently emerged B1 strains in the United States were also detected as early as 2011 in Hong Kong. The four lineages possessed distinct aa sequence patterns in BC and DE loops. Amino acid residues 97 and 140, within BC and DE-surface loops of VP1 respectively, were under potential positive selection. EV-D68 infections in Hong Kong usually peak in spring/summer, though with a delayed autumn/winter peak in 2011.

Indeed, overactive host innate immune responses to viral vectors have led to devastating consequences. Macrophages are important innate immune cells that recognize viruses and induce inflammatory responses at the early stage of infection. However, tissue resident macrophages are not easily activated by the mere presence of virus suggesting that their activation requires additional signals from other cells in the tissue in order to trigger inflammatory responses. Previously, we have shown that the cross-talk between epithelial cells and macrophages generates synergistic inflammatory responses during adenoviral vector infection. Here, we investigated whether ATP is involved in the activation of macrophages to induce inflammatory responses during an acute adenoviral infection. Using a macrophage-epithelial cell co-culture system we demonstrated that ATP signaling through P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R) is required for induction of inflammatory mediators. We also showed that ATP-P2X(7)R signaling regulates inflammasome activation as inhibition or deficiency of P2X(7)R as well as caspase-1 significantly reduced IL-1\u03B2 secretion. Furthermore, we found that intranasal administration of replication deficient adenoviral vectors in mice caused a high mortality in wild-type mice with symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome but the mice deficient in P2X(7)R or caspase-1 showed increased survival. In addition, wild-type mice treated with apyrase or inhibitors of P2X(7)R or caspase-1 showed higher rates of survival. The improved survival in the P2X(7)R deficient mice correlated with diminished levels of IL-1\u03B2 and IL-6 and reduced neutrophil infiltration in the early phase of infection. These results indicate that ATP, released during viral infection, is an important inflammatory regulator that activates the inflammasome pathway and regulates inflammatory responses.","publish_time":"2012-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Benjamin H.; Hwang, David M.; Palaniyar, Nades; Grinstein, Sergio; Philpott, Dana J.; Hu, Jim","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05bdc3cf6dad125ad6539580352cb341eeaec2b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3338466.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22558229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ATP-P2X","synergistic inflammatory responses","systemic inflammatory responses","R deficient mice","Acute viral infection","mice deficient","immune responses","acute adenoviral infection","deficiency of P2X","inhibitors of P2X","replication deficient viral vectors","important inflammatory regulator","activation of macrophages","adenoviral vector infection","induction of inflammatory mediators","wild-type mice","uncontrolled viral replication","early phase of infection","early stage of infection","caspase","intranasal administration of replication deficient adenoviral vectors","epithelial cells","inflammasome activation","reduced IL","tissue resident macrophages","important innate immune cells","increased survival","improved survival","diminished levels of IL","higher rates of survival","inflammasome pathway","overactive host","\u03B2 secretion","symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome","macrophage-epithelial cell co-culture system","high mortality","viruses","apyrase","damages","inhibition","neutrophil infiltration","additional signals","order","mere presence of virus","devastating consequences","receptor","cross","results"],"language":"en"},

This nationwide cohort study aimed to assess the rate of developing active TB among patients receiving dialysis for ESRD. METHODS: The Korean national health insurance database was used to identify patients receiving dialysis for new-onset ESRD during 2004\u20132013, who were propensity score matched to an equivalent number of non-dialysis subjects from the general population. The incidences of active TB in the ESRD and control cohorts were calculated for 2004\u20132013, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the ESRD-related risk of active TB. RESULTS: During 2004\u20132013, 59,584 patients received dialysis for newly diagnosed ESRD. In the dialysis and control cohorts, 457 (0.8%) and 125 (0.2%) cases of active TB were detected, respectively. Patients with ESRD were associated with a significantly higher risk of active TB compared to the controls (incidence rate ratio, 4.80). The ESRD cohort had an independently elevated risk of active TB (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.39; 95% confidence interval, 3.60\u20135.37). CONCLUSION: We found that patients receiving dialysis for ESRD had an elevated risk of active TB. These results highlight the need for detailed and well-organised guidelines for active TB screening among patients with ESRD.","publish_time":"2018-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Min, Jinsoo; Kwon, Soon Kil; Jeong, Hye Won; Han, Joung-Ho; Kim, Yeonkook Joseph; Kang, Minseok; Kang, Gilwon","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fac6a0008107bdbd3d6e609f613ea7b59288e36c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6306323.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30595682/; https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2018.33.e341","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ESRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ESRD-related risk of active TB","active TB screening","incidences of active TB","cases of active TB","ESRD cohort","elevated risk of active TB","higher risk of active TB","diagnosed ESRD","new-onset ESRD","small number of patients","equivalent number of non-dialysis subjects","control cohorts","RESULTS","incidence rate ratio","adjusted hazard ratio","nationwide cohort study","significant public health burden","Korean national health insurance database","well-organised guidelines","need","end-stage renal disease","controls","converging epidemics of tuberculosis","multivariable Cox proportional hazards model","previous studies","METHODS","general population","BACKGROUND","propensity score","confidence interval","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Thus, Cav-1 plays crucial roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in a cell-specific and contextual manner. In addition, Cav-1 is essential for embryonic development of vertebrates owing to its regulation of BMP, Wnt, TGF-\u03B2 and other key signaling molecules. Moreover, Cav-1 is mainly expressed in terminally differentiated cells and its abnormal expression is often associated with human diseases, such as tumor progression, cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis, lung regeneration, and diseases related to virus.

To simplify this procedure, IgY antibodies specific for poxviral proteins (F1L and p28) were generated by immunisation of chickens, because antibody retrieval from eggs allows the non-invasive generation of huge amounts of antibodies. The main intentions were (i) to decrease invasiveness, (ii) to immunise with native forms of proteins and (iii) to circumvent previous protein expression and purification. Therefore, chicken were immunised with DNA expression vectors coding for conserved domains of the selected proteins delivered for the first time by a gene gun. Four weeks after initial immunisation specific antibodies were found in the egg yolk as proven by immunofluorescence staining of poxvirus-infected cells. The specific IgY titre rose to 1:80,000 and was stable for more than 120 days.

However, despite the advanced diagnostic methods currently in use, in 20 to 50% of respiratory samples a specific pathogen cannot be detected. In this work, we used a metagenomic approach and deep sequencing to examine respiratory samples from children with lower and upper respiratory tract infections that had been previously found negative for 6 bacteria and 15 respiratory viruses by PCR. Nasal washings from 25 children (out of 250) hospitalized with a diagnosis of pneumonia and nasopharyngeal swabs from 46 outpatient children (out of 526) were studied. DNA reads for at least one virus commonly associated to respiratory infections was found in 20 of 25 hospitalized patients, while reads for pathogenic respiratory bacteria were detected in the remaining 5 children. For outpatients, all the samples were pooled into 25 DNA libraries for sequencing. In this case, in 22 of the 25 sequenced libraries at least one respiratory virus was identified, while in all other, but one, pathogenic bacteria were detected. In both patient groups reads for respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus-OC43, and rhinovirus were identified. In addition, viruses less frequently associated to respiratory infections were also found. Saffold virus was detected in outpatient but not in hospitalized children. Anellovirus, rotavirus, and astrovirus, as well as several animal and plant viruses were detected in both groups. No novel viruses were identified. Adding up the deep sequencing results to the PCR data, 79.2% of 250 hospitalized and 76.6% of 526 ambulatory patients were positive for viruses, and all other children, but one, had pathogenic respiratory bacteria identified. These results suggest that at least in the type of populations studied and with the sampling methods used the odds of finding novel, clinically relevant viruses, in pediatric respiratory infections are low.","publish_time":"2014-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taboada, Blanca; Espinoza, Marco A.; Isa, Pavel; Aponte, Fernando E.; Arias-Ortiz, Mar\u00EDa A.; Monge-Mart\u00EDnez, Jes\u00FAs; Rodr\u00EDguez-V\u00E1zquez, Rub\u00E9n; D\u00EDaz-Hern\u00E1ndez, Fidel; Z\u00E1rate-Vidal, Fernando; Wong-Chew, Rosa Mar\u00EDa; Firo-Reyes, Ver\u00F3nica; del R\u00EDo-Almend\u00E1rez, Carlos N.; Gait\u00E1n-Meza, Jes\u00FAs; Villase\u00F1or-Sierra, Alberto; Mart\u00EDnez-Aguilar, Gerardo; Salas-Mier, Ma. del Carmen; Noyola, Daniel E.; P\u00E9rez-G\u00F3nzalez, Luis F.; L\u00F3pez, Susana; Santos-Preciado, Jos\u00E9 I.; Arias, Carlos F.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f00227d35cee08706713c7085ec576b74ff2f9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4239085.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25412469/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Anellovirus"],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","respiratory samples","pathogenic respiratory bacteria","respiratory syncytial virus","pediatric respiratory infections","hospitalized children","upper respiratory tract infections","outpatient children","novel viruses","relevant viruses","plant viruses","frequent cause of respiratory disease","pathogenic bacteria","hospitalized patients","Saffold virus","deep sequencing results","DNA libraries","PCR data","sampling methods","patient groups","ambulatory patients","sequenced libraries","advanced diagnostic methods","nasopharyngeal swabs","coronavirus-OC43","metagenomic approach","odds","diagnosis of pneumonia","astrovirus","animal","specific pathogen","type of populations","Anellovirus","rotavirus","work","rhinovirus","Nasal washings","outpatients","addition","case"],"language":"en"},

Emerging evidence also suggests that specific macrodomain-containing proteins, including ARTD8, macroD1, macroD2 and C6orf130, which are distinct from those affecting PARylation, interact with MARylation on target proteins to \u0027read\u0027 and \u0027erase\u0027 this modification. Thus, studying macrodomain-containing proteins is key to understanding the function and regulation of MARylation.

The current FMD vaccine provides no protection until 7days after the vaccination, which reduces its effectiveness in the case of an outbreak. Therefore, to find an alternative method of applying antiviral agents for rapid and enhanced inhibition of the FMD virus (FMDV), we compared the antiviral effects of promising antiviral agents and attempted to apply them in combination. First, we measured and compared the 50% effective concentration (EC50) to the mean inhibition effects of FMDV, and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) to the mean cytotoxicity of antiviral agents such as ribavirin, guanidine-hydrochloride (guanidine-HCl), 6-azauridine, and recombinant adenovirus expressing three small interference RNAs (Ad-siRNA) or porcine interferon-\u03B1 (Ad-porcine IFN-\u03B1) in swine kidney cells (IBRS-2). The selectivity indices of ribavirin (35.2) and 6-azauridine (34.6) were higher than that of guanidine-HCl (26.9). The selectivity indices of Ad-siRNA or Ad-porcine IFN-\u03B1 were 7\u00D7103 or 7\u00D7104 based on the adenoviral titer. Next, we tested the combined effects of the FMDV inhibition agents. Enhanced inhibition effects were observed in the IBRS-2 cells and in suckling mice from the combination of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03B1 and Ad-siRNA or ribavirin. The combined application of these recombinant adenoviruses and ribavirin may enhance their inhibitory effect on FMDV and overcome FMDV resistance against antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2012-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Su-Mi; Park, Jong-Hyeon; Lee, Kwang-Nyeong; Kim, Se-Kyung; Ko, Young-Joon; Lee, Hyang-Sim; Cho, In-Soo","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3b7c9fff5621c9e46b3c862bb4a1c6c7d80c14c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114081.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23000495/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354212002069; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.09.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354212002069","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FMDV inhibition agents","Ad-siRNA","Ad-porcine IFN-\u03B1","combination of Ad","antiviral effects of promising antiviral agents","mean inhibition effects of FMDV","selectivity indices of Ad","Enhanced inhibition effects","mean cytotoxicity of antiviral agents","porcine interferon-\u03B1","combined effects","selectivity indices of ribavirin","guanidine-HCl","overcome FMDV resistance","FMD virus","guanidine-hydrochloride","IBRS","azauridine","current FMD vaccine","recombinant adenoviruses","mouth disease","combined application","cytotoxic concentration","effective concentration","swine kidney cells","significant animal disease","small interference RNAs","inhibitory effect","protection","EC50","suckling mice","speed","CC50","alternative method","effectiveness","vaccination","days","Abstract Foot","case","outbreak","transmission","adenoviral titer"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we developed a transgenic mouse model globally expressing codon-optimized human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV. After intranasal inoculation with MERS-CoV, the mice rapidly developed severe pneumonia and multi-organ damage, with viral replication being detected in the lungs on day 5 and in the lungs, kidneys and brains on day 9 post-infection. In addition, the mice exhibited systemic inflammation with mild to severe pneumonia accompanied by the injury of liver, kidney and spleen with neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. Importantly, the mice exhibited symptoms of paralysis with high viral burden and viral positive neurons on day 9. Taken together, this study characterizes the tropism of MERS-CoV upon infection.

In one (A/P\u2019) the tRNA is in contact with the translocase EF-2 which induces it. In the other (A/P\u201D) the translocase is absent.

Self-reported health problems were monitored, and a serologic study was initiated among persons living and/or working on SBV-affected farms. In the study set-up, we addressed the vector and direct transmission routes for putative zoonotic transfer. In total, 69 sheep farms, 4 goat farms, and 50 cattle farms were included. No evidence for SBV-neutralizing antibodies was found in serum of 301 participants.

Although there are accounts of only these eight lectures, they reflect the diversity that is characteristic of ICAR \u2013 employment (academia, industry, public health), type of research (virus biology, potential antiviral targets, antiviral drugs, research organisation) and a range of viruses. For example, the viruses included were hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus (Mike Sofia), HIV and hepatitis B virus (David Chu), multiple antiviral projects (Maaike Everts), dengue (Priscilla Yang), rhinovirus C (Ann Palmenberg), polio (Mark Pallansch), HIV (Eric Hunter) and Zika virus (Pei-Yong Shi).

Abstract Objective: The Covid-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods: We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (Covid-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results: Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions: This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Conejero, Isma\u00EBl; Berrouiguet, Sofian; Ducasse, Deborah; Leboyer, Marion; Jardon, Vincent; Oli\u00E9, Emilie; Courtet, Philippe","journal":"Encephale","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8441a447cabbc8be4e8b838fcd5fbeb632274ba3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300853; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300853?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["The Covid","the dimensions","the perception","the elderly","The aim","the suicidal process","the current pandemic","The scientific community","likely to increase the emergence","quarantine could increase the feeling","this review is to analyze the impact","Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints","innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context","suicide secondary to this crisis","its interaction with the various risk factors","dimensions du processus suicidaire","the political authorities fear an epidemic","suicidal ideation","suicidal vulnerability","id\u00E9es de suicide","acte suicidaire","vuln\u00E9rabilit\u00E9 suicidaire","risque suicidaire \u00E9lev\u00E9","quarantine may prevent suicide risk","suicide attempts during this crisis","confinement","Several suicide prevention tools","placed in quarantine","Social distancing","impact de la pand\u00E9mie","individuals exposed to economic insecurity","This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions","social pain in vulnerable individuals","their place in new modes","However it is time to innovate","Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted","narrative review","pandemic affected today more than","their influence","revue narrative","outils de pr\u00E9vention","pand\u00E9mie actuelle","diff\u00E9rents facteurs de risque","crise in\u00E9dite","Conclusions","more than half","solutions innovantes adapt\u00E9es","protocole VigilanS","Many factors","individus expos\u00E9s","We also","personnes \u00E2g\u00E9es","individus vuln\u00E9rables","nombreux facteurs","mesures de pr\u00E9vention","contraintes de la distanciation","revue de la litt\u00E9rature","international publications dealing with major pandemics","should be tested","outils de sant\u00E9 connect\u00E9e","We carried out","nouveaux modes de soins","medical staff","disconnection","worldwide","care","Th\u00E9rapie Comportementale","buddhist","personnel m\u00E9dical","health","troisi\u00E8me vague","humanity","autorit\u00E9s politiques","derived practices","articles internationaux","grandes pand\u00E9mies","SARS","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie de suicides secondaires","douleur sociale","forte pr\u00E9carit\u00E9 \u00E9conomique","art engagement","pratique artistique","large scale","Methods","\u00E9mergence","Results","passage","sentiment de d\u00E9connexion","Abstract Objective","communaut\u00E9 scientifique","R\u00E9sultats","monde","innovation","SRAS","Resumen Objectifs","grande \u00E9chelle","heure","moiti\u00E9","humanit\u00E9","M\u00E9thodes"],"language":"fr"},

We used a novel style of electropositive filter media particle to concentrate the SARS-CoV from the sewage of two hospitals receiving SARS patients in Beijing. We also used cell culture, RT-PCR and gene sequencing to detect and identify the viruses from sewage. No infectious SARS-CoV contamination was found in any of the samples collected, but the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV could be detected in the sewage from the two hospitals before disinfection. While the RNA was only detected in three samples from the 309th Hospital, the others were negative after disinfection. These findings provide strong evidence that SARS-CoV can be excreted through the stool/urine of patients into sewage system, thus making the sewage system a possible route of transmission.","publish_time":"2005-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xin-Wei; Li, Jin-Song; Guo, Ting-Kai; Zhen, Bei; Kong, Qing-Xin; Yi, Bin; Li, Zhong; Song, Nong; Jin, Min; Xiao, Wen-Jun; Zhu, Xiu-Mei; Gu, Chang-Qing; Yin, Jing; Wei, Wei; Yao, Wei; Liu, Chao; Li, Jian-Feng; Ou, Guo-Rong; Wang, Min-Nian; Fang, Tong-Yu; Wang, Gui-Jie; Qiu, Yao-Hui; Wu, Huai-Huan; Chao, Fu-Huan; Li, Jun-Wen","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a701dd3cb95f84821441fe6da76ba974c179eb3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112879.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093405001503; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093405001503","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["stools of SARS patients","stools of patients","infectious SARS-CoV contamination","urine of patients","nucleic acid of SARS","sewage system","hospitals","samples","disinfection","finding of positive RT-PCR results","possible route of transmission","transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","novel style of electropositive filter media particle","close contact","droplet secretions","gene sequencing","strong evidence","cell culture","findings","Beijing","viruses","RNA"],"language":"en"},

Recognizing the early symptoms and signs of sepsis are key: the confused, hypoxic, hypotensive patient with pyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and leucocytosis. Examination must include search for a source of infection and early drainage or debridement. Next to take appropriate cultures, give fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. If the picture does not improve over the next 6 hours step-up the treatment to include urine output monitoring, blood gases for base excess, lactate, haemoglobin and glucose. These will guide the management of vasopressors, insulin, fluids, transfusion and bicarbonate. If the hypotension persists (septic shock) the patient should be moved to intensive care. The most recent recommendations include the withdrawal of starch based colloids, dobutamine in place of dopamine and a higher threshold for the use of steroids. This should be instituted within 24 hours of the start of sepsis. Advanced care includes mechanical ventilation using the ARDSnet protocol.

In addition, OLP may be associated with HCV-related liver disease. We investigated the visual analogue scale (VAS) and effects of oral care gel, REFRECARE-H(\u00AE), on patients with OLP associated with HCV infection. RESULTS: Nine OLP patients (mean age 67.9 \u00B1 7.6 years) with HCV-related liver diseases were recruited and their VAS score determined along with a biochemical examination of the blood. Types of OLP included erosive (6 patients) and reticular (3). REFRECARE-H(\u00AE), an oral care gel (therapeutic dentifrice) containing hinokitiol, was applied by each patient as a thin layer on the oral membrane, after each meal and at bedtime for 30 days. Application of REFRECARE-H(\u00AE )improved the quality of life in all terms of dry mouth, breath odor, oral freshness, oral pain during rest, oral pain at a mealtimes, taste disorder, loss of appetite, sleep disorder, depressive mood and jitteriness. VAS scores of dry mouth, breath odor, oral freshness, and sleep disorder were significantly increased 30 days after application of REFRECARE-H(\u00AE )(P = 0.01, P = 0.05, P = 0.03, P = 0.04).

Few tests allow confirmation or exclusion of SARS within the first few days of infection. A gene chip is a useful tool for the study of microbial infections mainly for its capability of performing multi-target analysis in a single test. Objectives: Investigate the possibility of early detection of SARS virus from clinical samples using the gene chip-based method. Study design: We purified RNA from SARS-CoV obtained from routinely collected peripheral blood and sputum samples of 34 patients who had been identified as probable SARS patients by following the interim U.S. case definition. Four segments of the SARS-CoV were amplified using reverse transcription-nested PCR and the products examined using the 70-mer gene chips for SARS-CoV detection. Results: A blind-test of both peripheral blood and sputum specimens lead to the positive detection of SARS-CoV in 31 out of 34 patients. SARS-CoV was not found in peripheral blood or sputum specimens from three patients. Two of the 34 patients were only 3 days post-onset of symptoms and were subsequently confirmed to be SARS positive. Our results indicate that the gene chip-based molecular test is specific for SARS-CoV and allows early detection of patients with SARS with detection rate about 8% higher than the single PCR test when the sputum sample is available.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yi-ming; Yang, Ren-quan; Tao, Sheng-ce; Li, Ze; Zhang, Qiong; Gao, Hua-fang; Zhang, Zhi-wei; Du, Jian-yu; Zhu, Pei-xuan; Ren, Li-li; Zhang, Liang; Wang, Dong; Guo, Lan; Wang, Yan-bin; Guo, Yong; Zhang, Yan; Zhao, Chuan-zan; Wang, Can; Jiang, Di; Liu, Yan-hua; Yang, Hua-wei; Rong, Li; Zhao, Yan-jun; An, Shuang; Li, Zhe; Fan, Xiao-dong; Wang, Jian-wei; Cheng, Yun; Liu, Ou; Zheng, Zhong; Zuo, Huan-cong; Shan, Quan-zhong; Ruan, Li; L\u00FC, Zhan-xiu; Hung, Tao; Cheng, Jing","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25cc93bafacf163c6e315809b41ef6d814c15b15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108259.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653204002975; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653204002975","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV detection","SARS positive","SARS coronavirus","exclusion of SARS","positive detection of SARS","probable SARS patients","possibility of early detection of SARS virus","early detection of patients","single test","sputum samples","detection rate","sputum specimens","peripheral blood","single PCR test","molecular test","blind-test","gene chip-based method","mer gene chips","Results","clinical samples","Study design","days of infection","study of microbial infections","reverse transcription-nested PCR","days post-onset of symptoms","useful tool","capability","cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome","multi-target analysis","products","RNA","tests","confirmation","Abstract Background","case definition","Objectives","segments"],"language":"en"},

All IgG monoclonals isolated bound to P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) and recognized distinct epitopes in the N-terminus, NANP repeat region, and C-terminus. Strikingly, the most effective antibodies, as assessed in a humanized mouse model, bound not only to the repeat region, but also to a minimal peptide at the PfCSP N-terminal junction that is not in the RTS,S vaccine. These dual-specific antibodies were isolated from different donors and used VH3-30 or VH3-33 alleles carrying tryptophan or arginine at position 52.

Recently, aqueous extracts of Toona sinensis leaves (TSL-1) have demonstrated many biological effects both in vitro and in vivo. In the central nervous system, microglial activation and their proinflammatory responses are considered an important therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammatory disorders such as cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer\u0027s disease, and Parkinson\u0027s disease. The present study attempted to validate the effect of TSL-1 on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As inflammatory parameters, the production of nitric oxide (NO), inducible NO synthase, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 were evaluated. Our results demonstrate that TSL-1 suppresses LPS-induced NO production, tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 secretion, and inducible NO synthase protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner, without causing cytotoxicity. In addition, the inhibitory effects of TSL-1 in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia were extended to post-treatment suggesting the therapeutic potential of TSL-1. Therefore, this work provides the future evaluation of the role of TSL-1 in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by inhibition of inflammatory mediator production in activated microglia.","publish_time":"2013-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chao-Chuan; Tsai, Yee-Jean; Hsieh, Ya-Ching; Lin, Rong-Jyh; Lin, Chih-Lung","journal":"Kaohsiung J Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07aeb351d3d1ca9f8fe05a2eafd27813be01022b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cfbb869e732b53165379ce89ee061a4cb3d8f7d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118447.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1607551X13002490; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kjms.2013.09.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444536/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1607551X13002490","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of TSL","role of TSL","therapeutic potential of TSL","inhibitory effects of TSL","leaves of Toona sinensis","activated microglia","post-treatment","treatment of enteritis","LPS-stimulated BV","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 secretion","inhibition of inflammatory mediator production","production of nitric oxide","microglia-mediated neuroinflammation","treatment of neurodegenerative diseases","aqueous extracts of Toona sinensis leaves","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","inflammatory parameters","Parkinson\u0027s disease","biological effects","important therapeutic strategy","synthase protein expression","neuroinflammatory disorders","microglial activation","proinflammatory responses","cerebral ischemia","well-known traditional oriental medicine","concentration-dependent manner","central nervous system","future evaluation","lipopolysaccharide","addition","present study","cytotoxicity","work","infection","results"],"language":"en"},

Twenty\u2010nine AMH and one donkey were present on the farm when the outbreak occurred. One 10\u2010year\u2010old Quarter Horse mare, stabled at a separate location and owned by an employee of the farm, also tested positive. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of BCoV was performed at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) at Cornell on all faecal samples. The PCR assay used detects multiple beta coronaviruses, including, but not limited to, equine enteric coronavirus (ECoV). Novel findings regarding this BCoV infection in horses were recognised in this outbreak study. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the largest outbreak of BCoV described thus far in a closed herd on a single premise. The case fatality rate was 0% unlike that described in a previous outbreak of ECoV involving miniature horses and a miniature donkey (Fielding et al. 2015). The morbidity rate was lower in this outbreak than in previously described studies (Oue et al. 2013; Pusterla et al. 2013). This outbreak also demonstrated the potential for BCoV transmission via farm personnel. The duration of shedding of virus in the faeces among some asymptomatic horses in this outbreak was longer than previously described clinical cases of ECoV (Pusterla et al. 2013; Nemoto et al. 2014). This study suggests that asymptomatic animals may play a role in the maintenance of BCoV during an outbreak; therefore, the need for diagnostic testing of both clinically affected and apparently clinically normal horses on a premises followed by appropriate biosecurity and control measures.","publish_time":"2018-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodrich, E.

We performed a comprehensive analysis to identify the MERS transmission route and the ability of our routine infection-prevention policy to control this outbreak. METHODS: This is a case\u2013cohort study of retrospectively analysed data from medical charts, closed-circuit television, personal interviews and a national database. We analysed data of people at risk of MERS transmission including 228 in the emergency department (ED) and 218 in general wards (GW). Data of personnel location and movement, personal protection equipment and hand hygiene was recorded. Transmission risk was determined as the extent of exposure to the index patient: 1) high risk: staying within 2 m; 2) intermediate risk: staying in the same room at same time; and 3) low risk: only staying in the same department without contact. RESULTS: The index patient was an old patient admitted to our hospital. 11 transmissions from the index patient were identified; 4 were infected in our hospital. Personnel in the ED exhibited higher rates of compliance with routine infection-prevention methods as observed objectively: 93% wore a surgical mask and 95.6% washed their hands. Only 1.8% of personnel were observed to wear a surgical mask in the GW. ED had a higher percentage of high-risk individuals compared with the GW (14.5% vs. 2.8%), but the attack rate was higher in the GW (16.7%; l/6) than in the ED (3%; 1/33). There were no transmissions in the intermediate- and low-risk groups in the ED. Otherwise 2 patients were infected in the GW among the low-risk group. MERS were transmitted to them indirectly by staff who cared for the index patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provide compelling evidence that routine infection-prevention policies can greatly reduce nosocomial transmission of MERS. Conventional isolation is established mainly from contact tracing of patients during a MERS outbreak.

Objective This study aimed to investigate the association of innate and adaptive immunity with acute asthma attacks by analysing the role of IFN-\u03B3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D and cytokines. Material and methods This prospective study included 33 patients with viral-induced acute asthma and 30 children with controlled asthma. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for virus identification and asthma attack scores assessed in acute asthma group. Blood sampling for IP-10, TLR2, cathelicidin, vitamin D levels, and spirometric indices were employed. Results Serum IP-10 and cathelicidin levels of acute asthma group were significantly higher and vitamin D levels were lower than controlled asthma group (IP-10; p =0.006, cathelicidin; p =0.002, vitamin D; p \u003C0.001). Serum IP-10 levels showed a significant negative correlation with age (p =0.009), TLR2 (p =0.05) and spirometric indices (p =0.002) in all asthmatics and a significant positive correlation with parameters of asthma attack severity (p =0.03) in acute asthma group. Higher cathelicidin values showed significant positive relation to IP-10 (beta coefficient: 33, p =0.02). Serum IP-10 levels higher than 38.9pg/ml (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 47%, p =0.002) were predictive of virus-induced asthma. Serum IP-10 and vitamin D levels were found to be significantly related to viral-asthma attacks (IP-10; aOR: 8.93, p =0.03 and vitamin D; aOR: 0.82, p =0.001). Conclusions Innate immunity biomarkers such as serum IP-10 and cathelicidin can be used to predict viral-induced acute asthma. These biomarkers may provide potential new treatment targets for acute asthma.","publish_time":"2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arikoglu, T.; Akyilmaz, E.; Yildirim, D. D.; Batmaz, S. B.; Ulger, S.

Improvement of bacterial CAP diagnosis by biomarkers has been evaluated using chest X-ray infiltrate as the CAP gold standard, producing conflicting results. We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers in suspected CAP adults visiting emergency departments for whom CAP diagnosis was established by an adjudication committee which founded its judgment on a systematic multidetector thoracic CT scan. METHODS: In an ancillary study of a multi-center prospective study evaluating the impact of systematic thoracic CT scan on CAP diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were evaluated. Systematic nasopharyngeal multiplex respiratory virus PCR was performed at inclusion. An adjudication committee classified CAP diagnostic probability on a 4-level Likert scale, based on all available data. RESULTS: Two hundred patients with suspected CAP were analyzed. The adjudication committee classified 98 patients (49.0 %) as definite CAP, 8 (4.0 %) as probable, 23 (11.5 %) as possible and excluded in 71 (35.5 %, including 29 patients with pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray). Among patients with radiological pulmonary infiltrate, 23 % were finally classified as excluded. Viruses were identified by PCR in 29 % of patients classified as definite. Area under the curve was 0.787 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 0.717 to 0.857] for CRP and 0.655 (95 % CI, 0.570 to 0.739) for PCT to detect definite CAP. CRP threshold at 50 mg/L resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.76 and a negative predictive value of 0.75. No PCT cut-off resulted in satisfactory positive or negative predictive values. CRP and PCT accuracy was not improved by exclusion of the 25 (25.5 %) definite viral CAP cases. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with suspected CAP visiting emergency departments, diagnostic accuracy of CRP and PCT are insufficient to confirm the CAP diagnosis established using a gold standard that includes thoracic CT scan. Diagnostic accuracy of these biomarkers is also insufficient to distinguish bacterial CAP from viral CAP.

Half-life of IgG is important in determining response to antigens and timing of vaccination in calves. To date studies evaluating half-life of colostrum replacer or plasma derived IgG are lacking. The objectives of this study were to compare the serum half-life of IgG derived from colostrum, colostrum replacer and plasma in dairy calves reared up to 35 days of age.

Serum samples were collected at 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days. Serum IgG concentrations were determined by radial immunodiffusion. The results indicated that half-life for IgG in colostrum fed (28.5 days) or plasma transfused calves (27.3 days) was longer than colostrum replacer fed calves (19.1 days).

Identifying mechanisms driving pathogen persistence is a vital component of wildlife disease ecology and control. Asymptomatic, chronically infected individuals are an oft\u2010cited potential reservoir of infection, but demonstrations of the importance of chronic shedding to pathogen persistence at the population\u2010level remain scarce. 2. Studying chronic shedding using commonly collected disease data is hampered by numerous challenges, including short\u2010term surveillance that focuses on single epidemics and acutely ill individuals, the subtle dynamical influence of chronic shedding relative to more obvious epidemic drivers, and poor ability to differentiate between the effects of population prevalence of chronic shedding vs. intensity and duration of chronic shedding in individuals. 3. We use chronic shedding of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) as a case study to illustrate how these challenges can be addressed. Using leptospirosis\u2010induced strands as a measure of disease incidence, we fit models with and without chronic shedding, and with different seasonal drivers, to determine the time\u2010scale over which chronic shedding is detectable and the interactions between chronic shedding and seasonal drivers needed to explain persistence and outbreak patterns. 4. Chronic shedding can enable persistence of L. interrogans within the sea lion population. However, the importance of chronic shedding was only apparent when surveillance data included at least two outbreaks and the intervening inter\u2010epidemic trough during which fadeout of transmission was most likely. Seasonal transmission, as opposed to seasonal recruitment of susceptibles, was the dominant driver of seasonality in this system, and both seasonal factors had limited impact on long\u2010term pathogen persistence. 5. We show that the temporal extent of surveillance data can have a dramatic impact on inferences about population processes, where the failure to identify both short\u2010 and long\u2010term ecological drivers can have cascading impacts on understanding higher order ecological phenomena, such as pathogen persistence.","publish_time":"2017-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buhnerkempe, Michael G.; Prager, Katherine C.; Strelioff, Christopher C.; Greig, Denise J.; Laake, Jeff L.; Melin, Sharon R.; DeLong, Robert L.; Gulland, Frances M.D.; Lloyd\u2010Smith, James O.","journal":"J Anim Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cec4532414e43295bce63c118492705f09304ab4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166352.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28207932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Leptospira"],"locations":["Pomona","California"],"keyphrases":["importance of chronic shedding","duration of chronic shedding","persistence of","effects of population prevalence of chronic shedding","chronic shedding of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona","subtle dynamical influence of chronic shedding relative","long\u2010term pathogen persistence","Seasonal transmission","different seasonal drivers","seasonal factors","long\u2010term ecological drivers","population processes","obvious epidemic drivers","collected disease data","sea lion population","seasonal recruitment of susceptibles","short\u2010term surveillance","ill individuals","temporal extent of surveillance data","infected individuals","measure of disease incidence","dramatic impact","limited impact","fadeout of transmission","numerous challenges","vital component of wildlife disease ecology","California sea lions","intervening inter\u2010epidemic trough","higher order ecological phenomena","cascading impacts","Zalophus californianus","intensity","interactions","outbreaks","demonstrations","system","poor ability","single epidemics","cited potential reservoir of infection","time","induced strands","dominant driver of seasonality","case study","control","inferences","scale","level","models","leptospirosis","failure","mechanisms","outbreak patterns"],"language":"en"},

Active surveillance is essential to identify the causative agents and to improve clinical management, especially in the context of possible circulation of pandemic viruses. FINDINGS: A prospective study was conducted in the Central African Republic (CAR) between January and December 2010 among infants and children aged 0\u201315 years attending sentinel sites for influenza-like illness or acute respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, and one-step real-time and multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses were detected in 49 of the 329 (14.9%) nasopharyngeal samples: 29 (8.8%) contained influenza viruses (5 (1.5%) had pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus and 24 (7.3%) had influenza B viruses), 11 (3.3%) contained parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 3 and 9 (2.7%) contained human respiratory syncytial virus. Most cases were detected during the rainy season in the CAR. Analysis of the amplicon sequences confirmed the identity of each detected virus. CONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance system in the CAR has provided valuable data on the seasonality of influenza and the circulation of other respiratory viruses.

TRALI is one of the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities and specific therapies are unavailable. Neutrophils are recognized as the major pathogenic cells, whereas T regulatory cells and dendritic cells appear to be important for protection against TRALI. The pathogenesis, however, is complex and incompletely understood. It is frequently postulated that the complement system plays an important role in the TRALI pathogenesis. In this article, we assess the evidence regarding the involvement of complement in TRALI from both human and animal studies. We hypothesize about the potential connection between the complement system and neutrophils in TRALI. Additionally, we draw parallels between TRALI and other acute pulmonary disorders of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome regarding the involvement of complement. We conclude that, even though a role for complement in the TRALI pathogenesis seems plausible, studies investigating the role of complement in TRALI are remarkably limited in number and also present conflicting findings. Different types of TRALI animal models, diverse experimental conditions, and the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota may perhaps all be factors which contribute to these discrepancies. More systematic studies are warranted to shed light on the contribution of the complement cascade in TRALI. The underlying clinical condition of the patient, which influences the susceptibility to TRALI, as well as the transfusion factor (antibody-mediated vs non\u2013antibody-mediated), will be important to take into consideration when researching the contribution of complement. This should significantly increase our understanding of the role of complement in TRALI and may potentially result in promising new treatment strategies.","publish_time":"2019-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jongerius, Ilse; Porcelijn, Leendert; van Beek, Anna E.; Semple, John W.; van der Schoot, C.

This has therapeutic concern and such knowledge is also required for prudent use of antimicrobials. METHODS: In a case control study Esherichia coli isolated from faecal samples from dairy calves were phenotyped by biochemical fingerprinting and analyzed for virulence genes by PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Farm management data were collected and Fisher\u0027s exact test and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: Of 95 E. coli tested for antimicrobial susceptibility 61% were resistant to one or more substances and 28% were multi-resistant. The virulence gene F5 (K99) was not found in any isolate. In total, 21 out of 40 of the investigated virulence genes were not detected or rarely detected. The virulence genes espP, irp, and fyuA were more common in resistant E. coli than in fully susceptible isolates (P \u003C 0.05). The virulence gene terZ was associated with calf diarrhea (P \u2264 0.01). The participating 85 herds had a median herd size of 80 lactating cows. Herds with calf diarrhea problems were larger (\u003E 55 cows; P \u003C 0.001), had higher calf mortality (P \u2264 0.01) and calf group feeders were more in use (P \u003C 0.05), compared to herds without calf diarrhea problems. There was no association between calf diarrhea and diversity of enteric E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance was common in E. coli from pre-weaned dairy calves, occurring particularly in calves from herds experiencing calf diarrhea problems. The results indicate that more factors than use of antimicrobials influence the epidemiology of resistant E. coli. Enteropathogenic E. coli seems to be an uncommon cause of neonatal calf diarrhea in Swedish dairy herds. In practice, calf diarrhea should be regarded holistically in a context of infectious agents, calf immunity, management practices etc. We therefore advice against routine antimicrobial treatment and recommend that bacteriological cultures, followed by testing for antimicrobial susceptibility and for virulence factors, are used to guide decisions on such treatment.","publish_time":"2012-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Verdier, Kerstin; Nyman, Ann; Greko, Christina; Bengtsson, Bj\u00F6rn","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1817050ed534376723c94abc3b5496beea55ed5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3287958.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22280887/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-54-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher","E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["calf diarrhea problems","calf immunity","uncommon cause of neonatal calf diarrhea","Antimicrobial susceptibility","calf group feeders","higher calf mortality","virulence factors","virulence genes espP","investigated virulence genes","role of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli","Swedish dairy herds","occurrence of antimicrobial resistance","routine antimicrobial treatment","virulence gene terZ","virulence gene F5","case control study Esherichia coli","young calves","epidemiology of resistant","multi-resistant","pre-weaned dairy calves","knowledge","prudent use of antimicrobials","RESULTS","management practices","lactating cows","Farm management data","Fisher\u0027s exact test","faecal samples","median herd size","multivariable logistic regression analysis","context of infectious agents","advice","fyuA","bacteriological cultures","irp","testing","determination of minimum inhibitory concentration","biochemical fingerprinting","diversity of enteric","susceptible isolates","METHODS","Sweden","K99","substances","CONCLUSIONS","association","therapeutic concern","BACKGROUND","decisions","PCR","total"],"language":"en"},

These are proteins with roles in virus entry or morphogenesis. In the case of the HIV fusion protein gp41 cholesterol binding is attributed to a cholesterol recognition consensus (CRAC) motif in a flexible domain of the ectodomain preceding the trans-membrane segment. This specific CRAC sequence mediates gp41 binding to a cholesterol affinity column. Mutations in this motif arrest virus fusion at the hemifusion stage and modify the ability of the isolated CRAC peptide to induce segregation of cholesterol in artificial membranes. Influenza A virus M2 protein co-purifies with cholesterol. Its proton translocation activity, responsible for virus uncoating, is not cholesterol-dependent, and the transmembrane channel appears too short for integral raft insertion. Cholesterol binding may be mediated by CRAC motifs in the flexible post-TM domain, which harbours three determinants of binding to membrane rafts. Mutation of the CRAC motif of the WSN strain attenuates virulence for mice. Its affinity to the raft\u2013non-raft interface is predicted to target M2 protein to the periphery of lipid raft microdomains, the sites of virus assembly. Its influence on the morphology of budding virus implicates M2 as factor in virus fission at the raft boundary. Moreover, M2 is an essential factor in sorting the segmented genome into virus particles, indicating that M2 also has a role in priming the outgrowth of virus buds. SFV E1 protein is the first viral type-II fusion protein demonstrated to directly bind cholesterol when the fusion peptide loop locks into the target membrane. Cholesterol binding is modulated by another, proximal loop, which is also important during virus budding and as a host range determinant, as shown by mutational studies.","publish_time":"2010-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schroeder, Cornelia","journal":"Cholesterol Binding and Cholesterol Transport Proteins:","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1b015c3bfbd8a8cf779cb35c26144ed286f5790.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176229.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20213541/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-8622-8_3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRAC","SFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","virus uncoating","virus fission","virus entry","virus particles","virus M2 protein co-","segregation of cholesterol","cholesterol-dependent","motif arrest virus fusion","morphology of budding virus","HIV fusion protein gp41 cholesterol binding","Semliki Forest virus","sites of virus assembly","outgrowth of virus buds","cholesterol affinity column","handful of viral cholesterol-binding proteins","gp41 binding","cholesterol recognition consensus","determinants of binding","CRAC motifs","raft boundary","isolated CRAC peptide","target membrane","specific CRAC sequence","non-raft interface","integral raft insertion","SFV E1 protein","fusion peptide loop locks","periphery of lipid raft microdomains","flexible domain","membrane rafts","trans-membrane segment","flexible post-TM domain","viral type","essential factor","proximal loop","hemifusion stage","transmembrane channel","ability","ectodomain","WSN strain","segmented genome","proton translocation activity","virulence","roles","case","Mutations","host range determinant","mice","artificial membranes","morphogenesis","influence","mutational studies"],"language":"en"},

The Zika virus (ZIKV) illustrated this, as there was limited information and awareness of the virus when it was identified as a public health emergency in February 2016. Predicting which virus may pose a future threat is difficult. This is in part because significant knowledge gaps in the basic biology and ecology of an emerging virus can impede policy development, delay decision making, and hinder public health action. We suggest using a phylogenetic framework of pathogens and their infected host species for insight into which animals may serve as reservoirs. For example, examining flaviviruses closely related to ZIKV, the phylogenetic framework indicates New World monkeys are the most likely candidates to be potential reservoirs for ZIKV. Secondarily, mammals that are in close proximity to humans should be considered because of the increased opportunity for pathogen exchange. The increase in human-mediated environmental change is accelerating the probability of another previously overlooked virus becoming a significant concern. By investing in basic science research and organizing our knowledge into an evolutionary framework, we will be better prepared to respond to the next emerging infectious disease.

In spite of a high mortality rate in pregnant women with fulminant hepatitis, no antiviral drugs or licensed vaccine is available in India. HEV-protease is a pivotal enzyme responsible for ORF1 polyprotein processing leading to cleavage of the non-structural enzymes involved in virus replication. HEV-protease region encoding 432\u2013592 amino acids of Genotype-1 was amplified, expressed in Sf21 cells and purified in its native form. The recombinant enzyme was biochemically characterized using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and Immunofluorescence. The enzyme activity and the inhibition studies were conducted using Zymography, FTC-casein based protease assay and ORF1 polyprotein digestion. To conduct ORF1 digestion assay, the polyprotein, natural substrate of HEV-protease, was expressed in E. coli and purified. Cleavage of 186 kDa ORF1 polyprotein by the recombinant HEV-protease lead to appearance of non-structural proteins viz. Methyltransferase, Protease, Helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase which were confirmed through immunoblotting using antibodies generated against specific epitopes of the enzymes. FTC-casein substrate was used for kinetic studies to determine Km and Vmax of the enzyme and also the effect of different metal ions and other protease inhibitors. A 95% inhibition was observed with E-64 which was validated through in silico analysis. The correlation coefficient between inhibition and docking score of Inhibitors was found to have a significant value of r(2) = 0.75. The predicted 3D model showed two domain architecture structures similar to Papain like cysteine protease though they differed in arrangements of alpha helices and beta sheets. Hence, we propose that HEV-protease has characteristics of \u201CPapain-like cysteine protease,\u201D as determined through structural homology, active site residues and class-specific inhibition. However, conclusive nature of the enzyme remains to be established.","publish_time":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saraswat, Shweta; Chaudhary, Meenakshi; Sehgal, Deepak","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac5854f7ef4751d0a621fafd02e4cd05b08321cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6989534.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32039053/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2019.00478","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["protease assay","cysteine protease","protease inhibitors","HEV-protease region","recombinant HEV-protease lead","recombinant enzyme","ORF1 polyprotein digestion","ORF1 polyprotein processing","kDa ORF1 polyprotein","natural substrate of HEV","inhibition studies","enzyme activity","ORF1 digestion assay","pivotal enzyme responsible","class-specific inhibition","Papain","non-structural enzymes","FTC-casein substrate","cleavage","Hepatitis E virus","fulminant hepatitis","RNA dependent RNA polymerase","specific epitopes","kinetic studies","score of Inhibitors","virus replication","appearance of non-structural proteins","domain architecture structures similar","Helicase","active site residues","antiviral drugs","pregnant women","high mortality rate","Methyltransferase","D model","licensed vaccine","structural homology","immunoblotting","effect of different metal ions","Zymography","arrangements of alpha helices","SDS-PAGE","Western blotting","beta sheets","characteristics","global health concern","decade","Immunofluorescence","India","spite","amino acids of Genotype","antibodies","correlation coefficient","Vmax","Sf21 cells","native form","significant value of r","conclusive nature","silico analysis","coli"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to compare the community burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza across different age groups and study years and gain insight into the extent to which traditional surveillance underestimates this burden. METHODS: Using preseason and postseason serology, weekly illness reporting, and RT-PCR identification of influenza from nasal swabs, we tracked the course of seasonal and pandemic influenza over five successive cohorts (England 2006\u201311; 5448 person-seasons\u0027 follow-up). We compared burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic strains. We weighted analyses to the age and regional structure of England to give nationally representative estimates. We compared symptom profiles over the first week of illness for different strains of PCR-confirmed influenza and non-influenza viruses using ordinal logistic regression with symptom severity grade as the outcome variable. FINDINGS: Based on four-fold titre rises in strain-specific serology, on average influenza infected 18% (95% CI 16\u201322) of unvaccinated people each winter. Of those infected there were 69 respiratory illnesses per 100 person-influenza-seasons compared with 44 per 100 in those not infected with influenza. The age-adjusted attributable rate of illness if infected was 23 illnesses per 100 person-seasons (13\u201334), suggesting most influenza infections are asymptomatic. 25% (18\u201335) of all people with serologically confirmed infections had PCR-confirmed disease. 17% (10\u201326) of people with PCR-confirmed influenza had medically attended illness. These figures did not differ significantly when comparing pandemic with seasonal influenza. Of PCR-confirmed cases, people infected with the 2009 pandemic strain had markedly less severe symptoms than those infected with seasonal H3N2. INTERPRETATION: Seasonal influenza and the 2009 pandemic strain were characterised by similar high rates of mainly asymptomatic infection with most symptomatic cases self-managing without medical consultation. In the community the 2009 pandemic strain caused milder symptoms than seasonal H3N2.

HCoV are now known to be involved in more serious respiratory diseases, i.e. bronchitis, bronchiolitis or pneumonia, especially in young children and neonates, elderly people and immunosuppressed patients. They have also been involved in nosocomial viral infections. In 2002\u20132003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), due to a newly discovered coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV); led to a new awareness of the medical importance of the Coronaviridae family. This pathogen, responsible for an emerging disease in humans, with high risk of fatal outcome; underline the pressing need for new approaches to the management of the infection, and primarily to its prevention. Another interesting feature of coronaviruses is their potential environmental resistance, despite the accepted fragility of enveloped viruses. Indeed, several studies have described the ability of HCoVs (i.e. HCoV 229E, HCoV OC43 (also known as betacoronavirus 1), NL63, HKU1 or SARS-CoV) to survive in different environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and humidity), on different supports found in hospital settings such as aluminum, sterile sponges or latex surgical gloves or in biological fluids. Finally, taking into account the persisting lack of specific antiviral treatments (there is, in fact, no specific treatment available to fight coronaviruses infections), the Coronaviridae specificities (i.e. pathogenicity, potential environmental resistance) make them a challenging model for the development of efficient means of prevention, as an adapted antisepsis-disinfection, to prevent the environmental spread of such infective agents. This review will summarize current knowledge on the capacity of human coronaviruses to survive in the environment and the efficacy of well-known antiseptic-disinfectants against them, with particular focus on the development of new methodologies to evaluate the activity of new antiseptic-disinfectants on viruses.","publish_time":"2012-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geller, Chlo\u00E9; Varbanov, Mihayl; Duval, Rapha\u00EBl E.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d171f82b892a2afafc2bc8a5458219dc04c8fd8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3509683.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v4113044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202515/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronaviruses infections","SARS-CoV","Coronaviridae family","potential environmental resistance","environmental spread","new approaches","new awareness","HCoV OC43","different environmental conditions","development of new methodologies","SARS-associated coronavirus","capacity of human coronaviruses","activity of new antiseptic-disinfectants","upper respiratory tract infections","Coronaviridae specificities","interesting feature of coronaviruses","enveloped RNA virus family","serious respiratory diseases","nosocomial viral infections","different supports","development of efficient means of prevention","efficacy of well-known antiseptic-disinfectants","accepted fragility of enveloped viruses","discovered coronavirus","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","specific treatment available","persisting lack of specific antiviral treatments","latex surgical gloves","sterile sponges","neonates","elderly people","aluminum","humans","large portion of common colds","young children","high risk of fatal outcome","emerging disease","hospital settings","pressing need","bronchitis","bronchiolitis","humidity","challenging model","temperature","medical importance","pathogenicity","current knowledge","particular focus","pneumonia","immunosuppressed patients","biological fluids","account","fact","betacoronavirus","management","NL63","HKU1","adapted antisepsis-disinfection","ability of HCoVs","infective agents","studies","review"],"language":"en"},

While there are several diagnostic methodologies available for RVFV detection, many are not sensitive enough to diagnose early infections. Furthermore, detection may be hindered by high abundant proteins such as albumin. Previous findings have shown that Nanotrap particles can be used to significantly enhance detection of various small analytes of low abundance. We have expanded upon this repertoire to show that this simple and efficient sample preparation technology can drastically improve the detection of the RVFV nucleoprotein (NP), the most abundant and widely used viral protein for RVFV diagnostics. RESULTS: After screening multiple Nanotrap particle architectures, we found that one particle, NT45, was optimal for RVFV NP capture, as demonstrated by western blotting. NT45 significantly enhanced detection of the NP at levels undetectable without the technology. Importantly, we demonstrated that Nanotrap particles are capable of concentrating NP in a number of matrices, including infected cell lysates, viral supernatants, and animal sera. Specifically, NT45 enhanced detection of NP at various viral titers, multiplicity of infections, and time points. Our most dramatic results were observed in spiked serum samples, where high abundance serum proteins hindered detection of NP without Nanotrap particles. Nanotrap particles allowed for sample cleanup and subsequent detection of RVFV NP. Finally, we demonstrated that incubation of our samples with Nanotrap particles protects the NP from degradation over extended periods of time (up to 120 hours) and at elevated temperatures (at 37\u00BAC). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that Nanotrap particles are capable of drastically lowering the limit of detection for RVFV NP by capturing, concentrating, and preserving RVFV NP in clinically relevant matrices. These studies can be extended to a wide range of pathogens and their analytes of diagnostic interest.","publish_time":"2015-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shafagati, Nazly; Lundberg, Lindsay; Baer, Alan; Patanarut, Alexis; Fite, Katherine; Lepene, Benjamin; Kehn-Hall, Kylene","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1196301d4e04f2283f18f95fbbbd6bc5cf6e341f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4447397.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0128215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26020252/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVFV","RVFV NP","NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVFV detection","subsequent detection of RVFV NP","Nanotrap particles","RVFV NP capture","NT45 enhanced detection of NP","limit of detection","capable of concentrating NP","RVFV diagnostics","RVFV nucleoprotein","detection of various small analytes of low abundance","screening multiple Nanotrap particle architectures","various viral titers","viral supernatants","high abundance serum proteins","viral protein","high abundant proteins","analytes of diagnostic","spiked serum samples","extended periods of time","sample cleanup","multiplicity of infections","number of matrices","efficient sample preparation technology","relevant matrices","dramatic results","time points","early infections","diagnostic methodologies available","Rift Valley fever virus","infected cell lysates","degradation","detrimental effect","levels undetectable","livestock","BACKGROUND","study","wide range of pathogens","human populations","animal sera","elevated temperatures","hours","albumin","pathogenic arthropod","Previous findings","incubation","western blotting","\u00BAC","CONCLUSION","studies","repertoire"],"language":"en"},

Disturbance of ER homeostasis may occur under various physiological or pathological conditions. In response to the ER stress, signaling pathways of the unfolded protein response (UPR) are activated. UPR is mediated by three ER transmembrane sensors, namely the PKR-like ER protein kinase (PERK), the inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1) and the activating transcriptional factor 6 (ATF6). UPR facilitates adaptation to ER stress by reversible translation attenuation, enhancement of ER protein folding capacity and activation of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In cells under prolonged and irremediable ER stress, UPR can also trigger apoptotic cell death. Accumulating evidence has shown that coronavirus infection causes ER stress and induces UPR in the infected cells. UPR is closely associated with a number of major signaling pathways, including autophagy, apoptosis, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways, innate immunity and pro-inflammatory response. Therefore, studies on the UPR are pivotal in elucidating the complicated issue of coronavirus-host interaction. In this paper, we present the up-to-date knowledge on coronavirus-induced UPR and discuss its potential involvement in regulation of innate immunity and apoptosis.","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fung, To Sing; Huang, Mei; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1caca4867233cd8f16de938ef36e2de365a95ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114476.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214004031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214004031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25304691/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER protein kinase","enhancement of ER protein","activation of ER","irremediable ER stress","coronavirus-induced UPR","ER transmembrane sensors","Disturbance of ER homeostasis","unfolded protein response","mitogen-activated protein","kinase pathways","major site of protein synthesis","coronavirus infection","complicated issue of coronavirus","apoptosis","Abstract Coronavirus replication","eukaryotic cells","infected cells","associated degradation","regulation of innate immunity","pro-inflammatory response","number of major","reversible translation attenuation","MAP","potential involvement","PKR","capacity","IRE1","modification","up-to-date knowledge","adaptation","activating transcriptional factor","sorting","host interaction","inositol","autophagy","PERK","apoptotic cell death","ATF6","pathological conditions","Accumulating evidence","ERAD","endoplasmic reticulum","paper","studies"],"language":"en"},

In this study we investigated whether persistently infected HeLa cells could be cured of EAV infection by treatment with an antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) designed to target the 5\u2032-terminal region of the EAV genome. We found that persistently infected HeLa cells passaged three times in the presence of 5\u201310\u03BCM EAV-specific PPMO produced no detectable virus. The PPMO-cured HeLa cells were free of infectious virus, viral antigen and EAV RNA as measured by plaque assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay and RT-PCR, respectively. Furthermore, when re-challenged with EAV at several passages after discontinuation of PPMO treatments, PPMO-cured HeLa cells were found to be refractory to re-infection and to the re-establishment of viral persistence.

METHODS: Secondary analysis of control participants in a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of handwashing to prevent household ILI transmission. We recruited index\u2010case patients with ILI \u2013 fever (\u003C5 years); fever, cough or sore throat (\u22655 years) \u2013 from health facilities, collected information on household factors and conducted syndromic surveillance among household contacts for 10 days after resolution of index\u2010case patients\u2019 symptoms.

RESULTS: Our sample was 1491 household contacts of 184 index\u2010case patients. Seventy\u2010one percentage reported that smoking occurred in their home, 27% shared a latrine with one other household and 36% shared a latrine with \u003E1 other household.

The disease associations for the closely related bocaviruses HBoV2-4 remain unknown. Increasing evidence shows that probiotics may reduce the risk of AOM of viral origin. Objectives of the study was to examine the prevalence and persistence of bocaviruses in consecutive nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) of otitis-prone children, and whether an association exists between HBoV and the child\u0027s characteristics, respiratory symptoms, and AOM pathogens, and whether probiotics reduce the occurrence of HBoV. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 6-month intervention study, 269 otitis-prone children (aged 9 months to 5.6 years), consumed daily either one capsule of probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, Bifidobacterium breve 99 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii JS) or placebo. After a clinical examination and NPS collected at three-time points, the presence and persistence of HBoV1-4 DNA in NPS was determined by RT-qPCR at the baseline, after 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: A high load (\u003E10,000 copies/ml) of HBoV DNA was detected in 26 (17.1%) of 152 children, and 16 (10.5%) showed a prolonged presence of HBoV for at least 3 months. None had DNA of HBoV2-4. Higher number of siblings associated with increased HBoV prevalence (p = 0.029). Prevalence or persistence of HBoV was not significantly associated with other characteristics, respiratory symptoms, or AOM pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS: HBoV, but not HBoV2-4, DNA occurs often in the nasopharynx of otitis-prone children, and may persist for 3\u20136 months. Probiotic treatment possibly reduced the presence of HBoV.","publish_time":"2011-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lehtoranta, Liisa; S\u00F6derlund-Venermo, Maria; Nokso-Koivisto, Johanna; Toivola, Hanna; Blomgren, Karin; Hatakka, Katja; Poussa, Tuija; Korpela, Riitta; Pitk\u00E4ranta, Anne","journal":"Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae9e3663f5d54898189a6b1de0141edd12a955a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172510.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2011.10.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22119148/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587611005660; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587611005660","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["L. rhamnosus"],"organizations":["NPS","AOM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["occurrence of HBoV","increased HBoV prevalence","prolonged presence of HBoV","number of HBoV DNA-positive samples","otitis-prone children","DNA of HBoV2","months","NPS","AOM pathogens","placebo","persistence of bocaviruses","respiratory symptoms","risk of AOM","nasopharynx of otitis","Probiotic intervention","acute otitis media","related bocaviruses HBoV2","persistence of HBoV1","capsule of probiotics","Probiotic treatment","OBJECTIVES","respiratory tract infections","month intervention study","rhamnosus Lc705","child\u0027s characteristics","Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG","consecutive nasopharyngeal samples","Higher number of siblings","role","Bifidobacterium breve","Propionibacterium freudenreichii JS","time points","copies","disease associations","RT-qPCR","high load","viral origin","Human bocavirus","RESULTS","baseline","METHODS","clinical examination","CONCLUSIONS","evidence","years"],"language":"en"},

We assessed two new DNA vaccines expressing premembrane and envelope Zika virus structural proteins. METHODS: We did two phase 1, randomised, open-label trials involving healthy adult volunteers. The VRC 319 trial, done in three centres, assessed plasmid VRC5288 (Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus chimera), and the VRC 320, done in one centre, assessed plasmid VRC5283 (wild-type Zika virus). Eligible participants were aged 18\u201335 years in VRC19 and 18\u201350 years in VRC 320. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 by a computer-generated randomisation schedule prepared by the study statistician. All participants received intramuscular injection of 4 mg vaccine. In VRC 319 participants were assigned to receive vaccinations via needle and syringe at 0 and 8 weeks, 0 and 12 weeks, 0, 4, and 8 weeks, or 0, 4, and 20 weeks. In VRC 320 participants were assigned to receive vaccinations at 0, 4, and 8 weeks via single-dose needle and syringe injection in one deltoid or split-dose needle and syringe or needle-free injection with the Stratis device (Pharmajet, Golden, CO, USA) in each deltoid. Both trials followed up volunteers for 24 months for the primary endpoint of safety, assessed as local and systemic reactogenicity in the 7 days after each vaccination and all adverse events in the 28 days after each vaccination. The secondary endpoint in both trials was immunogenicity 4 weeks after last vaccination. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02840487 and NCT02996461. FINDINGS: VRC 319 enrolled 80 participants (20 in each group), and VRC 320 enrolled 45 participants (15 in each group). One participant in VRC 319 and two in VRC 320 withdrew after one dose of vaccine, but were included in the safety analyses. Both vaccines were safe and well tolerated. All local and systemic symptoms were mild to moderate. In both studies, pain and tenderness at the injection site was the most frequent local symptoms (37 [46%] of 80 participants in VRC 319 and 36 [80%] of 45 in VRC 320) and malaise and headache were the most frequent systemic symptoms (22 [27%] and 18 [22%], respectively, in VRC 319 and 17 [38%] and 15 [33%], respectively, in VRC 320). For VRC5283, 14 of 14 (100%) participants who received split-dose vaccinations by needle-free injection had detectable positive antibody responses, and the geometric mean titre of 304 was the highest across all groups in both trials. INTERPRETATION: VRC5283 was well tolerated and has advanced to phase 2 efficacy testing.","publish_time":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaudinski, Martin R; Houser, Katherine V; Morabito, Kaitlyn M; Hu, Zonghui; Yamshchikov, Galina; Rothwell, Ro Shauna; Berkowitz, Nina; Mendoza, Floreliz; Saunders, Jamie G; Novik, Laura; Hendel, Cynthia S; Holman, LaSonji A; Gordon, Ingelise J; Cox, Josephine H; Edupuganti, Srilatha; McArthur, Monica A; Rouphael, Nadine G; Lyke, Kirsten E; Cummings, Ginny E; Sitar, Sandra; Bailer, Robert T; Foreman, Bryant M; Burgomaster, Katherine; Pelc, Rebecca S; Gordon, David N; DeMaso, Christina R; Dowd, Kimberly A; Laurencot, Carolyn; Schwartz, Richard M; Mascola, John R; Graham, Barney S; Pierson, Theodore C; Ledgerwood, Julie E; Chen, Grace L","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/074a55da5161bcf7f63991d18567e99b0dc98fb4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6379903.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673617331057; http://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140673617331057/pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(17)33105-7; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673617331057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29217376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VRC","Golden, CO","USA","ClinicalTrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weeks","Eligible participants","needle-free injection","syringe injection","split-dose needle","dose of vaccine","Zika virus epidemic","single-dose needle","injection site","intramuscular injection","split-dose vaccinations","wild-type Zika virus","frequent systemic symptoms","frequent local symptoms","plasmid VRC5283","envelope Zika virus structural proteins","open-label trials","Japanese encephalitis virus chimera","days","systemic reactogenicity","deltoid","years","phase","primary endpoint of safety","rapid vaccine development","plasmid VRC5288","secondary endpoint","safety analyses","healthy adult volunteers","new DNA vaccines","premembrane","detectable positive antibody responses","congenital infections","Stratis device","Pharmajet","months","immunogenicity","headache","geometric mean titre","pain","tenderness","centres","computer-generated randomisation schedule","study statistician","adverse events","USA","malaise","BACKGROUND","FINDINGS","numbers NCT02840487","NCT02996461","studies","VRC19","groups","efficacy testing","METHODS","INTERPRETATION"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This prospective, multicentre cohort study was conducted in paediatric units in three university hospitals in Finland from 2008 to 2010. Hospital medical records were reviewed to collect data on clinical course, testing and treatment. Data were analysed separately for children meeting our strict definition of bronchiolitis, aged under 12 months without a history of wheezing, and a loose definition, aged 12\u201323 months or with a history of wheezing. RESULTS: The median age of the 408 children was 8.1 months. Clinical management varied between the three hospitals when stratified by strict and loose bronchiolitis subgroup definitions: complete blood counts ranged from 15\u201395% vs 16\u201394%, respectively, and the other measures were chest x\u2010ray (16\u201391% vs 14\u201372%), intravenous fluids (2\u201347% vs 2\u201341%), use of nebulised epinephrine (10\u201384% vs 7\u201350%), use of salbutamol (18\u201321% vs 13\u201384%) and use of corticosteroids (6\u201323% vs 60\u201376%).

Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) serves as an innate immune sensor and triggers antiviral responses upon recognizing viral infections including RSV. Since tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)-mediated K63-polyubiquitination is crucial for RIG-I activation, several viruses target initial RIG-I activation through ubiquitination. RSV NS1 and NS2 have been shown to interfere with RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling. In this study, we explored the possibility that NS1 suppresses RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling by targeting TRIM25. Ubiquitination of ectopically expressed RIG-I-2Cards domain was decreased by RSV infection, indicating that RSV possesses ability to inhibit TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Similarly, ectopic expression of NS1 sufficiently suppressed TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Furthermore, interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 was detected by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Further biochemical assays showed that the SPRY domain of TRIM25, which is responsible for interaction with RIG-I, interacted sufficiently with NS1. Suppression of RIG-I ubiquitination by NS1 resulted in decreased interaction between RIG-I and its downstream molecule, MAVS. The suppressive effect of NS1 on RIG-I signaling could be abrogated by overexpression of TRIM25. Collectively, this study suggests that RSV NS1 interacts with TRIM25 and interferes with RIG-I ubiquitination to suppress type-I interferon signaling.","publish_time":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ban, Junsu; Lee, Na-Rae; Lee, Noh-Jin; Lee, Jong Kil; Quan, Fu-Shi; Inn, Kyung-Soo","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45d3b6128146d7df335e96fb8257644f0a5fca14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6316657.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558248/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10120716","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Retinoic"],"organizations":["RSV","MAVS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["initial RIG","Suppression of RIG","RSV NS1","suppressed TRIM25-mediated RIG","overexpression of TRIM25","mediated antiviral","SPRY domain of TRIM25","RSV infection","ectopic expression of NS1","suppressive effect of NS1","decreased interaction","mediated K63-polyubiquitination","antiviral responses","activation","study","Cards domain","Respiratory syncytial virus","severe acute lower respiratory tract disease","viruses","ability","innate immune sensor","viral infections","protein","Retinoic acid-inducible gene","biochemical assays","downstream molecule","type","possibility","co-immunoprecipitation assay","tripartite motif","MAVS","interferon","NS2"],"language":"en"},

Various components of the immune system, including neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), Ad specific T cells and type I IFN activated NK cells, contribute to dampening the efficacy of Ad vectors in individuals with pre-existing Ad immunity. In order to circumvent pre-existing immunity to adenovirus, numerous strategies, such as developing alternative Ad serotypes, varying immunization routes and utilizing prime-boost regimens, are under pre-clinical or clinical phases of development. However, these strategies mainly focus on one arm of pre-existing immunity. Selection of alternative serotypes has been largely driven by the absence in the human population of nAbs against them with little attention paid to cross-reactive Ad specific T cells. Conversely, varying the route of immunization appears to mainly rely on avoiding Ad specific tissue-resident T cells. Finally, prime-boost regimens do not actually circumvent pre-existing immunity but instead generate immune responses of sufficient magnitude to confer protection despite pre-existing immunity. Combining the above strategies and thus taking into account all components regulating pre-existing Ad immunity will help further improve the development of Ad vectors for animal and human use.","publish_time":"2014-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fausther-Bovendo, Hugues; Kobinger, Gary P","journal":"Hum Vaccin Immunother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb6ac0e6f129a47a228c217485d17d091c8c2421.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5443060.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25483662/; https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.29594","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pre-existing Ad immunity","arm of pre-existing immunity","development of Ad vectors","alternative Ad serotypes","cross-reactive Ad specific T cells","efficacy of Ad vectors","Ad specific tissue-resident T cells","human adenovirus","human population","human use","NK cells","clinical use","prime-boost regimens","clinical phases of development","numerous strategies","varying immunization routes","Selection of alternative serotypes","immune system","Various components","route of immunization","immune responses of sufficient magnitude","individuals","derived vector","protection","little attention","IFN","animal","account","neutralizing antibodies","order","absence"],"language":"en"},

In healthy adult cats, monocytes have been shown to constitutively transcribe pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, in order to characterize the effect of age, feline monocyte functions were examined for changes in cytokine transcription levels in early stages of immunosenescence. For this purpose, isolated, short-term cultured monocytes from barrier-maintained adult cats of different ages (15mo to 10yr) were examined for transcription of IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40 and TNF-\u03B1 by real-time PCR. Transcription levels of cytokines varied and were generally highest for IL-1\u03B2. For IL-1\u03B2, IL-6 and IL-12 p40, both young and old cats exhibited highest levels. The age association was significant. TNF-\u03B1 appeared to be transcribed at similar levels over the examination period, whereas IL-10 tended to decline with age but without any statistical significant differences. The observed age association of the constitutive transcription of some cytokines indicates a drop in monocyte activities from youth to middle age, which is then followed by a (progressive) increase with increasing age. This provides evidence that monocytes are in part responsible for the pro-inflammatory status observed with ageing.","publish_time":"2005-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kipar, A.; Baptiste, K.; Meli, M.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of measuring serum IgG concentrations in asthma exacerbations and assess their link with viral infections in patients hospitalized for asthma. METHODS: Patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation were included in an observational study from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015. Serum IgG concentrations on admission were compared between patients with a positive upper airway viral sample and those with a negative viral sample. RESULTS: Among the 82 patients included, those with positive viral nasopharyngeal samples (n = 40) presented with lower serum IgG concentrations during exacerbation than those with a negative viral sample (n = 42) (10.1 \u00B1 2.3 g/L vs 11.5 \u00B1 3.6 g/L; P \u003C .05). The median concentration of serum IgG was lower in patients hospitalized for more than 3 days compared with those hospitalized for less than 3 days (10.0 g/L [8.2-12.4] vs 11.4 g/L [10.1-12.8]; P \u003C .05) and in patients who received oral corticosteroid therapy for more than 5 days compared with those treated with oral steroids for less than 5 days (10.1 g/L [8.3-12.2] vs 11.6 g/L [10.0-13.8]; P \u003C .05). CONCLUSIONS: Serum IgG level was significantly lower when asthma exacerbations were associated with positive viral samples. The patients with lower serum IgG concentrations required longer hospitalizations and longer courses of steroids.","publish_time":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verduyn, Morgane; Botto, Guillaume; Jaubert, Julien; Lier, Cl\u00E9ment; Flament, Thomas; Guilleminault, Laurent","journal":"J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13b49e7542ebba9db8c6198337d40e84699bd6b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104119.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219819300546; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2018.12.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654200/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219819300546","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Patients","lower serum IgG concentrations","Serum IgG level","days","severe asthma exacerbations","positive viral samples","negative viral sample","value of measuring serum IgG concentrations","median concentration of serum IgG","viral infections","positive viral nasopharyngeal samples","vs","positive upper airway viral sample","oral steroids","longer courses of steroids","longer hospitalizations","oral corticosteroid therapy","poorer quality of life","increase","link","BACKGROUND","admission","morbidity","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","observational study","mortality","Viruses","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Following replication in the nasal mucosa, BHV5 invades the central nervous system (CNS) mainly through the olfactory pathway. The innate immune response triggered by the host face to virus replication through the olfactory route is poorly understood. Recently, an upregulation of conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern, as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), has been demonstrated in the CNS of BHV5 experimentally infected cows. A new perspective to understand host-pathogen interactions has emerged elucidating microRNAs (miRNAs) network that interact with innate immune response during neurotropic viral infections. In this study, we demonstrated a link between the expression of TLRs 3, 7, and 9 and miR-155 transcription in the olfactory bulbs (OB) of 16 cows suffering from acute BHV5-induced neurological disease. The OBs were analyzed for viral antigens and genome, miR-155 and TLR 3, 7, and 9 expression considering three major regions: olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), glomerular layer (GL), and mitral cell layer (ML). BHV5 antigens and viral genomes, corresponding to glycol-C gene, were detected in all OBs regions by fluorescent antibody assay (FA) and PCR, respectively. TLR 3, 7, and 9 transcripts were upregulated in ORNs and ML, yet only ORN layers revealed a positive correlation between TLR3 and miR-155 transcription. In ML, miR-155 correlated positively with all TLRs studied. Herein, our results evidence miR-155 transcription in BHV5 infected OB tissue associated to TLRs expression specifically ORNs which may be a new window for further studies.","publish_time":"2017-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oliveira, Bruna R.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a pathogenic avian Gammacoronavirus of significant importance to the global poultry industry, has been shown to induce the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), zippered endoplasmic reticulum (zER) and tethered vesicles, known as spherules. These membrane rearrangements are virally induced; however, it remains unclear which viral proteins are responsible. In this study, membrane rearrangements induced when expressing viral non-structural proteins (nsps) from two different strains of IBV were compared. Three non-structural transmembrane proteins, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, were expressed in cells singularly or in combination and the effects on cellular membranes investigated using electron microscopy and electron tomography. In contrast to previously studied coronaviruses, IBV nsp4 alone is necessary and sufficient to induce membrane pairing; however, expression of the transmembrane proteins together was not sufficient to fully recapitulate DMVs. This indicates that although nsp4 is able to singularly induce membrane pairing, further viral or host factors are required in order to fully assemble IBV replicative structures.

In this study, we blended metagenomics, phylogenetics, homology modeling, and in vitro assays to characterize two novel bat calicivirus (BtCalV) capsid sequences, corresponding to strain BtCalV/A10/USA/2009, identified in Perimyotis subflavus near Little Orleans, MD, and bat norovirus. We observed that bat norovirus formed virus-like particles and had epitopes and receptor-binding patterns similar to those of human noroviruses. To determine whether these observations stretch across multiple bat caliciviruses, we characterized a novel bat calicivirus, BtCalV/A10/USA/2009. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BtCalV/A10/USA/2009 likely represents a novel Caliciviridae genus and is most closely related to \u0022recoviruses.\u0022 Homology modeling revealed that the capsid sequences of BtCalV/A10/USA/2009 and bat norovirus resembled human norovirus capsid sequences and retained host ligand binding within the receptor-binding domains similar to that seen with human noroviruses. Both caliciviruses bound histo-blood group antigens in patterns that overlapped those seen with human and animal noroviruses. Taken together, our results indicate the potential for bat caliciviruses to bind histo-blood group antigens and overcome a significant barrier to cross-species transmission. Additionally, we have shown that bat norovirus maintains antigenic epitopes similar to those seen with human noroviruses, providing further evidence of evolutionary descent. Our results reiterate the importance of surveillance of wild-animal populations, especially of bats, for novel viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2018-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kocher, Jacob F.; Lindesmith, Lisa C.; Debbink, Kari; Beall, Anne; Mallory, Michael L.; Yount, Boyd L.; Graham, Rachel L.; Huynh, Jeremy; Gates, J.

Conventional methods to quantify aerosol concentration that susceptible victims in contaminated environments are exposed to use real time particle counters to measure concentrations in environments without occupancy. Breathing-induced airflow interacts and influences concentration around nostrils or mouth and alter the ultimate exposure. This subject has not yet been systematically studied, particularly under transient emission. In this work, an experimental facility comprising two manikins was designed and fabricated. One of them mimicked realistic breathing, acting as a susceptible victim. Both steady and episodic emissions were generated in an air-conditioned environmental chamber in which two different ventilation schemes were tested. The scaled-dose of the victim under different expiratory velocities and pulmonary ventilation was measured. Inferring from results obtained from comprehensive tests, it can be concluded that breathing has very significant influence on the ultimate dose compared with that without breathing. Majority of results show that breathing reduces inhalation quantity and the reduction magnitude increases with breathing rate. This is attributed to the fact that the exhalation process plays a more significant role in reducing the dose level than the enhanced effect during inhalation period. The higher the breathing rate, the sharper the decline of the resultant concentration would be leading to lower dose. Nevertheless, under low pulmonary ventilation, results show that breathing increases dose marginally. Results also reveals that ventilation scheme also affects the exposure.","publish_time":"2011-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poon, Carmen K.M.; Lai, Alvin C.K.","journal":"Journal of Hazardous Materials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b908e5b09c2ce123eca5bfed0dd342c65fdc1fe6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116912.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389411008028; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.06.040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389411008028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21752541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["breathing increases dose","realistic breathing","breathing rate","ultimate dose","dose level","lower dose","scaled-dose","Abstract Estimating inhalation dose","Majority of results","different ventilation schemes","low pulmonary ventilation","aerosol concentration","influences concentration","resultant concentration","inhalation quantity","inhalation period","ultimate exposure","contaminated environments","susceptible victims","significant role","realistic conditions","significant influence","different expiratory velocities","concentrations","reduction magnitude","real time particle counters","air-conditioned environmental chamber","nostrils","mouth","enhanced effect","decline","exhalation process","episodic emissions","induced airflow","Conventional methods","manikins","experimental facility","accuracy of risk assessment","work","fact","occupancy","comprehensive tests","transient emission","subject"],"language":"en"},

Preventative measures lie mainly in vaccination, while the gold standard for IBV classification and differentiation is based on the sequence analysis of the spike 1 (S1) gene. In this study, we tested a new assay for IBV strain classification that is less expensive and requires reduced time and effort to perform. We carried out a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction followed by high-resolution melting (qRT-PCR/HRM) curve analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, qRT-PCR was conducted on a partial fragment S1 gene followed by a high resolution melting curve analysis (qRT-PCR/HRM) on 23 IBV-positive samples in Jordan. For this assay, we utilized the most common IBV vaccine strains (Mass and 4/91) as a reference in the HRM assay. To evaluate the discrimination power of the qRT-PCR/HRM, we did the sequencing of the partial S1 gene. RESULTS: It was shown that HRM was able to classify IBV samples into four clusters based on the degree of similarity between their melting points: The first cluster exhibited the highest similarity to the 4/91 strain, while the second was similar to the Mass-related IBV strain. Although the third cluster contained the highest number of samples, it displayed no similarity to any of the reference vaccine strains, and, after comparing them with the sequencing results, we found that the samples in the third cluster were similar to the variant II-like (IS-1494-06) IBV field strain. Finally, the fourth cluster comprised one unique sample that was found to belong to the Q1 IBV strain. CONCLUSION: Our developed qRT-PCR/HRM curve analysis was able to detect and rapidly identify novel and vaccine-related IBV strains as confirmed by S1 gene nucleotide sequences, making it a rapid and cost-effective tool.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ababneh, Mustafa; Ababneh, Ola; Al-Zghoul, Mohammad Borhan","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd7063854bd9db91cf3812f29a6eacf05b404eb3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183480.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2020.400-406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367941/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","HRM"],"locations":["Jordan"],"keyphrases":["IBV samples","IBV classification","IBV strain classification","IBV field strain","Q1 IBV strain","IBV-positive samples","Mass-related IBV strain","vaccine-related IBV strains","HRM assay","HRM curve analysis","common IBV vaccine strains","developed qRT-PCR","partial S1 gene","partial fragment S1 gene","reference vaccine strains","sequence analysis","S1 gene nucleotide sequences","highest similarity","high resolution melting curve analysis","highest number of samples","high-resolution melting","melting points","degree of similarity","new assay","study","sequencing results","avian infectious bronchitis virus","Coronaviridae family","differentiation","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","gold standard","novel","vaccination","renal diseases","spike","clusters","AIM","reduced time","effort","poultry","METHODS","discrimination power","CONCLUSION","Jordan","cost-effective tool","Preventative measures","MATERIALS","unique sample","variant","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Abstract From a literature survey, a long list of germs and pollutants found in shellfish has been drawn up, which are potential pathogens when eaten. These consist of microbes, which, carried by the effluent from human or animal communities, reach shoreline ponds and oyster production sites. Transmission from faecal material to the eaten seafood is the origin of a variety of clinical conditions: septicaemia, typhoid, viral hepatitis A, neurological syndromes, and gastro-enteritis induced by bacteria, parasites or viruses.

Vero cells were dually infected with ca-PEDV and one of the three chlamydial strains Chlamydia trachomatis S45, Chlamydophila abortus S26/3 or Chlamydophila pecorum 1710S. Three experimental protocols were designed varying the inoculation sequence. Cell layers were first inoculated with Chlamydiaceae and 20h later with ca-PEDV in protocol one. In protocol two, both agents were administered concurrently, whereas in protocol three, ca-PEDV was applied 20h in advance of the Chlamydiaceae. Immunofluorescence techniques, immunohistochemical (IH) staining and electron microscopy were subsequently employed to investigate the cell layers. Using indirect immunofluorescence (IF) labeling, all mixed infections revealed dually infected cells, however, only incidentally and in low numbers. Characteristically, ca-PEDV syncytia with one or more chlamydial inclusions were detected but dually infected single cells were absent. Some syncytial cells contained enlarged C. abortus or C. pecorum inclusions with abnormally large developmental forms. In comparison with simultaneously conducted monoinfections, larger chlamydial inclusions were observed in dually infected cell layers. Experiments with C. trachomatis showed significantly increased numbers of chlamydial inclusions in dually infected cell layers compared to monoinfected ones. These findings indicate an influence of ca-PEDV on the chlamydial developmental cycle and in the case of C. trachomatis, a positive effect on chlamydial colonization in mixed infections.","publish_time":"2005-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stuedli, Angela; Grest, Paula; Schiller, Irene; Pospischil, Andreas","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/884fa3917f4eb5915950c7462f1fc5158cb5d06f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126122.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113504004122; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113504004122","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chlamydophila"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected cell layers","infected cells","ca-PEDV syncytia","larger chlamydial inclusions","chlamydial colonization","influence of ca","infected single cells","increased numbers of chlamydial inclusions","pecorum inclusions","chlamydial developmental cycle","cell culture","chlamydial strains Chlamydia trachomatis S45","syncytial cells","Vero cells","additive effect of Chlamydiaceae","different Chlamydiaceae strains","Chlamydophila pecorum","mixed infections","Chlamydophila abortus S26","positive effect","enteropathogenic agents","Immunofluorescence techniques","low numbers","indirect immunofluorescence","large developmental forms","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","IH","bacterial interaction","staining","immunohistochemical","coexistence","case of","monoinfections","monoinfected ones","electron microscopy","Abstract","advance","experimental protocols","inoculation sequence","comparison","Experiments","findings"],"language":"en"},

Objective We sought to determine the increased yield obtained from influenza RT-PCR in hospitalized patients compared to two rapid methods. Study design Binax NOW, cytospin-enhanced direct immunofluoroescence (DFA), and influenza A and B multiplex TaqMan RT-PCR were performed on 237 clinical samples. Results Binax NOW detected 70 (53.0%), cytospin-DFA detected 127 (96.2%), and TaqMan RT-PCR detected 132 (100%) influenza-positive samples. The difference in sensitivity was significant between RT-PCR and Binax NOW (p \u003C0.0001), but not between RT-PCR and cytospin-DFA (p =0.0736). Two samples testing positive for influenza B by all three methods, tested falsely positive for influenza A by Binax. Eight true positive samples did not become reactive by Binax until 30min, and thus were counted as negative. Conclusions The accuracy of real-time RT-PCR should greatly improve the diagnosis of influenza in hospitals using simple rapid flu tests, but may have a more modest impact in hospitals with expertise in cytospin-DFA. Further studies are needed to determine the effect of influenza RT-PCR on patient management and costs in hospitalized patients.","publish_time":"2008-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Landry, Marie L.; Cohen, Sandra; Ferguson, David","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abfad60f844adad03c00982ab947a484c25fe159.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173065.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653208002175; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2008.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18639488/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653208002175","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of influenza RT-PCR","influenza-positive samples","influenza diagnosis","diagnosis of influenza","influenza B","accuracy of real-time RT-PCR","cytospin-DFA","B multiplex TaqMan RT-PCR","rapid methods","hospitalized patients","true positive samples","Results Binax","clinical samples","simple rapid flu tests","Study design Binax","Abstract Background Rapid tests","hospitals","significant impact","accurate tests","modest impact","patient management","expertise","costs","sensitivity","direct immunofluoroescence","increased yield","Conclusions","difference","Objective","studies"],"language":"en"},

Viruses are recognized as the predominant causative agents of acute respiratory infections. In Senegal, few data concerning the causes of respiratory infections are available, and those known relate mainly to classical influenza infections. Clinical and virological surveillance of acute respiratory infections was carried out in a rural community in children less than 5 years old. A standardized questionnaire was used and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each patient. These samples were tested for the detection of 20 respiratory viruses by multiplex RT\u2010PCR or by viral culture. A total of 82 acute respiratory episodes were included, and 48 (58.5%) were found to be positive, with a total of 55 viral detections; several samples were positive for two (n = 5) or 3 (n = 1) viruses. Ten different viruses were identified: influenza viruses A, B, and C (n = 25), human respiratory syncytial virus type A (n = 13), rhinoviruses (n = 8), human coronaviruses type 229E and NL63 (n = 6), parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4 (n = 2), and bocavirus (n = 1). These results provide evidence on the importance and the diversity of viruses as causative agents of acute respiratory infections in children living in a rural community in Senegal. The establishment of sentinel surveillance sites could help estimate the burden of acute respiratory infection in the pediatric population and should help prepare the health care systems to identify and respond to new viral respiratory emergencies.

Mass media reports on an epidemic or pandemic can provide important information to the public, and in turn, can induce positive healthy behaviour practices (i.e., handwashing, social distancing) in the individuals, that will reduce the probability of contracting the disease. Mass media fatigue, however, can dampen these effects. Mathematical models can be used to study the effects of mass media reports on epidemic/pandemic outcomes. In this study we employ a stochastic agent based model to provide a quantification of mass media reports on the variability in important public health measurements. We also include mass media report data compiled by the Global Public Health Intelligence Network, to study the effects of mass media reports in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. We find that the report rate and the rate at which individuals relax their healthy behaviours (media fatigue) greatly affect the variability in important public health measurements. When the mass media reporting data is included in the model, two peaks of infection result.","publish_time":"2015-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Collinson, Shannon; Khan, Kamran; Heffernan, Jane M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55b2f19377928da52d9826a5de0714e5c75ebd02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4631512.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26528909/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Public Health Intelligence Network"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of mass media reports","Mass media fatigue","quantification of mass media reports","mass media report data","mass media reporting data","important public health measurements","important mandate of public health","effects of infection","study","important information","Global Public Health Intelligence Network","variability","epidemic","pandemic outcomes","H1N1 pandemic","individuals","report rate","healthy behaviours","peaks of infection result","positive healthy behaviour practices","handwashing","population","turn","social distancing","stochastic agent","spread of influenza","probability","Mathematical models","disease"],"language":"en"},

Today, approximately 75% of newly emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonoses that result from various anthropogenic, genetic, ecologic, socioeconomic, and climatic factors. These interrelated driving forces make it difficult to predict and to prevent zoonotic EIDs. Although significant improvements in environmental and medical surveillance, clinical diagnostic methods, and medical practices have been achieved in the recent years, zoonotic EIDs remain a major global concern, and such threats are expanding, especially in less developed regions. The current Ebola epidemic in West Africa is an extreme stark reminder of the role animal reservoirs play in public health and reinforces the urgent need for globally operationalizing a One Health approach. The complex nature of zoonotic diseases and the limited resources in developing countries are a reminder that the need for implementation of Global One Health in low-resource settings is crucial. The Veterinary Public Health and Biotechnology (VPH-Biotec) Global Consortium launched the International Congress on Pathogens at the Human-Animal Interface (ICOPHAI) in order to address important challenges and needs for capacity building. The inaugural ICOPHAI (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2011) and the second congress (Porto de Galinhas, Brazil, 2013) were unique opportunities to share and discuss issues related to zoonotic infectious diseases worldwide. In addition to strong scientific reports in eight thematic areas that necessitate One Health implementation, the congress identified four key capacity-building needs: (1) development of adequate science-based risk management policies, (2) skilled-personnel capacity building, (3) accredited veterinary and public health diagnostic laboratories with a shared database, and (4) improved use of existing natural resources and implementation. The aim of this review is to highlight advances in key zoonotic disease areas and the One Health capacity needs.","publish_time":"2014-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gebreyes, Wondwossen A.; Dupouy-Camet, Jean; Newport, Melanie J.; Oliveira, Celso J.

These glycoproteins undergo large-scale irreversible refolding during membrane fusion. The paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) mediates membrane merger through its fusion protein (F). The transmembrane (TM) domains of viral fusion proteins are typically required for fusion. The TM domain of F is particularly interesting in that it is potentially unusually long; multiple calculations suggest a TM helix length between 25 and 48 residues. Oxidative cross-linking of single cysteine substitutions indicates the F TM trimer forms a helical bundle within the membrane. To assess the functional role of the PIV5 F protein TM domain, alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed. Two residues located in the outer leaflet of the bilayer are critical for fusion. Multiple amino acid substitutions at these positions indicate the physical properties of the side chain play a critical role in supporting or blocking fusion. Analysis of intermediate steps in F protein refolding indicated that the mutants were not trapped at the open stalk intermediate or the prehairpin intermediate. Incorporation of a known F protein destabilizing mutation that causes a hyperfusogenic phenotype restored fusion activity to the mutants. Further, altering the curvature of the lipid bilayer by addition of oleic acid promoted fusion of the F protein mutants. In aggregate, these data indicate that the TM domain plays a functional role in fusion beyond merely anchoring the protein in the viral envelope and that it can affect the structures and steady-state concentrations of the various conformational intermediates en route to the final postfusion state. We suggest that the unusual length of this TM helix might allow it to serve as a template for formation of or specifically stabilize the lipid stalk intermediate in fusion.","publish_time":"2009-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bissonnette, Mei Lin Z.; Donald, Jason E.; DeGrado, William F.; Jardetzky, Theodore S.; Lamb, Robert A.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec575d33c0d3b34af7644fcfed64af045a75ab63.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f7590a6695397ebaa3f3fb1b2343a5825631aa30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2750892.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2750892?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283608015404; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.12.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283608015404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19121325/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["membrane fusion","fusion activity","TM domain of F","F protein mutants","F protein refolding","PIV5 F protein TM domain","F TM trimer","fusion-mediating glycoproteins","domains of viral fusion proteins","TM helix length","known F protein destabilizing mutation","membrane merger","functional role","critical role","prehairpin intermediate","open stalk intermediate","lipid bilayer","Analysis of intermediate steps","lipid stalk","viral envelope","residues","Multiple amino acid substitutions","multiple calculations","unusual length","addition of oleic acid","steady-state concentrations","large-scale irreversible refolding","final postfusion state","Oxidative cross-linking of single cysteine substitutions","various conformational intermediates","positions","hyperfusogenic phenotype","alanine scanning mutagenesis","helical bundle","chain","outer leaflet","viruses","Incorporation","host cell membranes","physical properties","paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus","structures","curvature","cells","data","template","aggregate"],"language":"en"},

Methods We expressed the complete SARS coronavirus envelope spike (S) protein from a recombinant attenuated parainfluenza virus (BHPIV3) that is being developed as a live attenuated, intranasal paediatric vaccine against human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3). We immunised eight African green monkeys, four with a single dose of BHPIV3/SARS-S and four with a control, BHPIV3/Ctrl, administered via the respiratory tract. A SARS-coronavirus challenge was given to all monkeys 28 days after immunisation. Findings Immunisation of animals with BHPIV3/SARS-S induced the production of SARS-coronavirus-neutralising serum antibodies, indicating that a systemic immune response resulted from mucosal immunisation. After challenge with SARS coronavirus, all monkeys in the control group shed SARS coronavirus, with shedding lasting 5\u20138 days.

Metagenomic sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is capable of identifying a variety of pathogens. Here, we describe a method using a large panel of oligo probes to enrich sequence targets of 34 respiratory DNA and RNA viruses that reduces non-viral reads in NGS data and achieves high performance of sequencing-based pathogen identification. The approach can be applied to total nucleic acids purified from respiratory swabs stored in viral transport medium. Illumina TruSeq RNA Access Library procedure is used in targeted sequencing of respiratory viruses. The samples are subjected to RNA fragmentation, random reverse transcription, random PCR amplification, and ligation with barcoded library adaptors. The libraries are pooled and subjected to two rounds of enrichments by using a large panel of oligos designed to capture whole genomes of 34 respiratory viruses. The enriched libraries are amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq sequencing system and reagents. This method can achieve viral detection sensitivity comparable with molecular assay and obtain partial to complete genome sequences for each virus to allow accurate genotyping and variant analysis.

We built and employed IDseq, a cloud-based, open access, bioinformatics platform and service to identify microbes from metagenomic next-generation sequencing of tissue samples. In this pilot study, we evaluated blood, nasopharyngeal, and stool specimens from 94 children (aged 2-54 months) with febrile illness admitted to Tororo District Hospital, Uganda. The most common pathogens identified were Plasmodium falciparum (51.1% of samples) and parvovirus B19 (4.4%) from blood; human rhinoviruses A and C (40%), respiratory syncytial virus (10%), and human herpesvirus 5 (10%) from nasopharyngeal swabs; and rotavirus A (50% of those with diarrhea) from stool. Among other potential pathogens, we identified one novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, from the blood of a child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, and Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx of a child with rash and sepsis. We also identified two novel human rhinovirus C species. This exploratory pilot study demonstrates the utility of mNGS and the IDseq platform for defining the molecular landscape of febrile infectious diseases in resource limited areas.

This article provides guidance for ophthalmologists on how to deliver the best possible care for patients while minimizing the risk of infection. METHODS: The Vision Academy\u2019s Steering Committee of international retinal disease experts convened to discuss key considerations for managing patients with retinal disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the existing literature on the issue, members put forward recommendations that were systematically refined and voted on to develop this guidance. RESULTS: The considerations focus on the implementation of steps to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19. These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms. Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible. In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring. CONCLUSION: Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need. The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Korobelnik, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Loewenstein, Anat; Eldem, Bora; Joussen, Antonia M.; Koh, Adrian; Lambrou, George N.; Lanzetta, Paolo; Li, Xiaoxin; L\u00F6vestam-Adrian, Monica; Navarro, Rafael; Okada, Annabelle A.; Pearce, Ian; Rodr\u00EDguez, Francisco J.; Wong, David T.; Wu, Lihteh","journal":"Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7cb43ae2083d08f2769a93724235c23963ffadd4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179379.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328757/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-020-04703-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Vision Academy\u2019s Steering Committee"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exposure of patients","symptomatic patients","Management of patients","triaging of patients","safety of patients","risk of exposure","healthcare staff","pandemic","intravitreal injections","monitoring visits","ongoing global COVID","ophthalmologists","risk of infection","patient exposure","best possible care","Vision Academy\u2019s Steering Committee of international retinal disease experts","guidance","greatest risk of irreversible vision loss","prioritization of treatment visits","greatest medical need","treatment regimens","key considerations","ophthalmic care","frequent monitoring","urgent need","anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents","adherence","scrupulous hygiene","disinfection protocols","use of personal protective equipment","regular clinical practice","adjustment","issue","members","METHODS","paramount importance","implementation of steps","existing literature","number of people","order","important measures","CONCLUSION","rooms","recommendations","decision-making","PURPOSE","article","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The infections are transmitted from contaminated food and water, through the air, direct contact, or by insects. The main modes of RTIs transmission include droplet infection and direct contact. The clinical spectrum of RTIs in travelers is broad, from upper respiratory tract infections, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, to influenza-like illness. The spectrum of microbial agents causing respiratory infections include numerous viruses and bacteria, rarely fungi, and parasites. Most travelers complain of mild infections, only a small minority seek medical assistance and report to health care facilities. Because of the risk of importing pathogens into Europe or North America and transferring them onto the local population, it is important to present the scale of the problem in relation to rapid development of tourism industry and an increasing number of intercontinental journeys. The aim of the study was to discuss the occurrence of travel-related respiratory infections among representatives of temperate climate traveling to and returning from the tropics.","publish_time":"2014-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Korzeniewski, Krzysztof; Nitsch-Osuch, Aneta; Lass, Anna; Guzek, Aneta","journal":"Environmental Biomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce8106b79db566c503b0343190cf18a399abeda7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120182.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381557/; https://doi.org/10.1007/5584_2014_89","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","North America"],"keyphrases":["related respiratory infections","mild infections","upper respiratory tract infections","travelers","clinical spectrum of RTIs","direct contact","large number of pathogens","main modes of RTIs transmission","risk of exposure","spectrum of microbial agents","health care facilities","common health problems","increasing number of intercontinental journeys","report","medical assistance","droplet infection","numerous viruses","poor sanitation standards","relation","harsh environmental conditions","rapid development of tourism industry","small minority","bacteria","bronchitis","pharyngitis","representatives of temperate climate traveling","skin lesions","pneumonia","diarrheas","occurrence of travel","South American destinations","fevers of unknown origin","fungi","water","Europe","air","infectious diseases","North America","contaminated food","scale","influenza","subtropical countries","local population","study","illness","Visitors","parasites","insects","aim","tropics"],"language":"en"},

Over the past few years, there have been many reports on their applications in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. The high thermal and moisture stabilities of many Schiff base complexes were useful attributes for their application as catalysts in reactions involving at high temperatures. The activity is usually increased by complexation therefore to understand the properties of both ligands and metal can lead to the synthesis of highly active compounds. The influence of certain metals on the biological activity of these compounds and their intrinsic chemical interest as multidentate ligands has prompted a considerable increase in the study of their coordination behaviour.

To elucidate the evolution of MERS-CoV-related viruses and their interspecies transmission pathway, samples were collected from different mammals in China. A novel coronavirus related to MERS-CoV, Erinaceus amurensis hedgehog coronavirus HKU31 (Ea-HedCoV HKU31), was identified from two Amur hedgehogs. Genome analysis supported that Ea-HedCoV HKU31 represents a novel species under Merbecovirus, being most closely related to Erinaceus CoV from European hedgehogs in Germany, with 79.6% genome sequence identity. Compared to other members of Merbecovirus, Ea-HedCoV HKU31 possessed unique non-structural proteins and putative cleavage sites at ORF1ab. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Ea-HedCoV HKU31 and BetaCoV Erinaceus/VMC/DEU/2012 were closely related to NeoCoV and BatCoV PREDICT from African bats in the spike region, suggesting that the latter bat viruses have arisen from recombination between CoVs from hedgehogs and bats. The predicted HKU31 receptor-binding domain (RBD) possessed only one out of 12 critical amino acid residues for binding to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor. The structural modeling of the HKU31-RBD-hDPP4 binding interphase compared to that of MERS-CoV and Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) suggested that HKU31-RBD is unlikely to bind to hDPP4. Our findings support that hedgehogs are an important reservoir of Merbecovirus, with evidence of recombination with viruses from bats. Further investigations in bats, hedgehogs and related animals are warranted to understand the evolution of MERS-CoV-related viruses.","publish_time":"2019-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Susanna K.

Most IFITMs have been well characterised in human and mouse but little published data exists for other animals. This study characterised IFITMs in two distantly related marsupial species, the Australian tammar wallaby and the South American grey short-tailed opossum, and analysed the phylogeny of the IFITM family in vertebrates. RESULTS: Five IFITM paralogues were identified in both the tammar and opossum. As in eutherians, most marsupial IFITM genes exist within a cluster, contain two exons and encode proteins with two transmembrane domains. Only two IFITM genes, IFITM5 and IFITM10, have orthologues in both marsupials and eutherians. IFITM5 arose in bony fish and IFITM10 in tetrapods. The bone-specific expression of IFITM5 appears to be restricted to therian mammals, suggesting that its specialised role in bone production is a recent adaptation specific to mammals. IFITM10 is the most highly conserved IFITM, sharing at least 85% amino acid identity between birds, reptiles and mammals and suggesting an important role for this presently uncharacterised protein. CONCLUSIONS: Like eutherians, marsupials also have multiple IFITM genes that exist in a gene cluster. The differing expression patterns for many of the paralogues, together with poor sequence conservation between species, suggests that IFITM genes have acquired many different roles during vertebrate evolution.","publish_time":"2012-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hickford, Danielle; Frankenberg, Stephen; Shaw, Geoff; Renfree, Marilyn B","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e9aa1aef7efca6b41b1503135145e0dd75a39ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3424830.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-13-155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22537233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFITM paralogues","marsupial IFITM genes","multiple IFITM genes","IFITM family","conserved IFITM","IFITMs","IFITM10","eutherians","bone-specific expression of IFITM5","bone production","marsupials","therian mammals","promotion of homotypic cell adhesion","promotion of bone matrix maturation","control of cell proliferation","related marsupial species","mediating germ cell development","diverse roles","different roles","Interferon inducible transmembrane proteins","important role","specialised role","transmembrane domains","gene cluster","Australian tammar wallaby","recent adaptation specific","differing expression patterns","South American grey short-tailed opossum","mineralisation","viral infection","protection","reptiles","human","little published data","mouse","birds","phylogeny","amino acid identity","poor sequence conservation","BACKGROUND","bony fish","orthologues","animals","uncharacterised protein","vertebrate evolution","tetrapods","vertebrates","exons","study","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

During northern Italian outbreak of respiratory disease in a broiler flock in 2013, an IBV strain was detected by RT-PCR and characterized as Q1-like based on partial S1 sequence. The virus was isolated and named \u03B3CoV/Ck/Italy/I2022/13. All coding regions of the isolate were sequenced and compared with 130 complete genome sequences of IBV and TCoV, downloaded from ViPR. This showed the highest identity with a Chinese strain CK/CH/LDL/97I (p-distance=0.044). To identify potential recombination events a complete genome SimPlot analysis was carried out which revealed the presence of possible multiple recombination events, but the minor parent strains remained unknown. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene was performed using all complete S1 sequences available on ViPR and showed the isolate clustered with an Q1-like strain isolated in Italy in 2011 (p-distance=0.004) and a group of Chinese Q1-like strains isolated from the mid 90\u0027s (p-distance equal or higher than 0.001).

On day 1, all calves received one portion (3 kg) of colostrum within 2 h after birth. Between the second feeding and the age of 5 days, control calves received only transition milk that had been collected from dams shortly before feeding, and the treatment group received 1.5 kg of colostrum collected from dams on day 1 and 1.5 kg of transition milk from subsequent milkings. Monthly body weight and average daily gain were used to measure growth performance. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein at multiple time points to evaluate the biochemical and immune status of calves. Colostrum-supplemented transition milk increased the concentrations of serum immunoglobulins, triacylglycerols, cholesterol and total protein. The activity of lactate-dehydrogenase and ceruloplasmin decreased, whereas lysozyme activity increased with time in the control group.

One method to increase vaccination rates may be the distribution of oral rabies vaccines (ORVs). ONRAB\u00AE (Artemis Technologies, Inc., Ontario, Canada) is the primary ORV used in Canada to vaccinate striped skunks and raccoons. To investigate the potential use of ONRAB\u00AE ORV baits to vaccinate feral domestic dogs against rabies on tribal lands and beyond, we performed a flavor preference study. A total of 7 bait flavors (bacon, cheese, dog food, hazelnut, sugar-vanilla, peanut butter, and sardine) were offered in pairs to 13 domestic dogs. Each dog was offered all possible combinations of bait pairs over a period of 10 days, with each bait offered 6 times. The proportion of times each bait was consumed first by individual dogs was calculated and comparisons among dogs were conducted using the MIXED procedure in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Pairwise comparisons between baits were performed using \u201Ccontrast\u201D statements with sugar-vanilla flavor as the default for comparison.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the molecular epidemiology of HRV infections in young children seeking acute medical care. STUDY DESIGN: Nasal swabs collected from symptomatic children \u003C3 years of age receiving care in the Emergency and Urgent Care Departments at Seattle Children\u0027s Hospital were analyzed by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (FilmArray\u00AE) for multiple viruses including HRV/enterovirus. HRV-positive results were confirmed by laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR (LD-PCR). Clinical data were collected by chart review. A subset of samples was selected for sequencing using the 5\u2019 noncoding region. Associations between LRTI and HRV species and genotypes were estimated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 595 samples with HRV/enterovirus detected by FilmArray, 474 (80%) were confirmed as HRV by LD-PCR. 211 (96%) of 218 selected samples were sequenced; HRV species A, B, and C were identified in 133 (63%), 6 (3%), and 72 (34%), respectively. LRTI was more common in HRVC than HRV-A illness episodes (adjusted OR [95% CI] 2.35[1.03-5.35). Specific HRV-A and HRV-C genotypes detected in multiple patients were associated with a greater proportion of LRTI episodes. In 18 patients with \u003E1 HRV-positive illness episodes, a distinct genotype was detected in each. CONCLUSION: Diverse HRV genotypes circulated among symptomatic children during the study period. We found an association between HRV-C infections and LRTI in this patient population and evidence of association between specific HRV genotypes and LRTI.","publish_time":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Emily K.; Kuypers, Jane; Chu, Helen Y.; Lacombe, Kirsten; Qin, Xuan; Strelitz, Bonnie; Bradford, Miranda; Jones, Charla; Klein, Eileen J.; Englund, Janet A.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb82e4b48eccec63331781f992e86e19b4cd25da.json; document_parses/pdf_json/da0ac5ca59cccd00e9de165b34d835f4446f5f58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4403738.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214004144; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.11.006; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4403738?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542466/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214004144","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV","LRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV species","HRV-C genotypes","HRV-C infections","Diverse HRV genotypes","specific HRV genotypes","HRV-positive results","HRV-positive illness episodes","molecular epidemiology of HRV infections","LD-PCR","greater proportion of LRTI episodes","symptomatic children","selected samples","young children","multiple patients","FilmArray","enterovirus","subset of samples","real-time reverse transcription PCR","Urgent Care Departments","acute medical care","evidence of association","multiple viruses","STUDY DESIGN","study period","severe lower tract illnesses","mild upper respiratory tract","Seattle Children\u0027s Hospital","Emergency","laboratory","system","patient population","rapid polymerase chain reaction","Nasal swabs","HRVC","years of age","sequencing","distinct genotype","Human rhinovirus","logistic regression analysis","Clinical data","chart review","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","Associations","noncoding region","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

In this regard, coronaviruses have evolved a complicated receptor-recognition system through their spike proteins. Spikes from highly related coronaviruses can recognize distinct receptors, whereas spikes of distant coronaviruses can employ the same cell-surface molecule for entry. Moreover, coronavirus spikes can recognize a broad range of cell-surface molecules in addition to the receptors and thereby can augment coronavirus attachment or entry. The receptor of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). In this study, we identified membrane-associated 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) as an additional binding target of the MERS-CoV spike. Further analyses indicated that GRP78 could not independently render nonpermissive cells susceptible to MERS-CoV infection but could facilitate MERS-CoV entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus attachment. More importantly, by exploring potential interactions between GRP78 and spikes of other coronaviruses, we discovered that the highly conserved human GRP78 could interact with the spike protein of bat coronavirus HKU9 (bCoV-HKU9) and facilitate its attachment to the host cell surface. Taken together, our study has identified GRP78 as a host factor that can interact with the spike proteins of two Betacoronaviruses, the lineage C MERS-CoV and the lineage D bCoV-HKU9. The capacity of GRP78 to facilitate surface attachment of both a human coronavirus and a phylogenetically related bat coronavirus exemplifies the need for continuous surveillance of the evolution of animal coronaviruses to monitor their potential for human adaptations.","publish_time":"2018-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Hin; Chan, Che-Man; Zhang, Xi; Wang, Yixin; Yuan, Shuofeng; Zhou, Jie; Au-Yeung, Rex Kwok-Him; Sze, Kong-Hung; Yang, Dong; Shuai, Huiping; Hou, Yuxin; Li, Cun; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Leung, Sze Pui; Yeung, Man-Lung; Yan, Jinghua; Lu, Guangwen; Jin, Dong-Yan; Gao, George Fu; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c28104ade24576026c7726062ae53983dfe9bf32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6066311.xml.json","url":"http://www.jbc.org/content/293/30/11709.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra118.001897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29887526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["coronavirus spikes","coronavirus attachment","human coronavirus","MERS-CoV spike","Coronavirus tropism","MERS-CoV entry","related bat coronavirus","surface attachment","spike protein of bat coronavirus HKU9","MERS-CoV infection","spikes of distant coronaviruses","capacity of GRP78","related coronaviruses","host cell surface","lineage C MERS-CoV","conserved human GRP78","host receptors","spike proteins","cell-surface molecule","surface molecules","receptor of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","evolution of animal coronaviruses","lineage D bCoV-HKU9","distinct receptors","human adaptations","host factor","study","broad range of cell","potential interactions","nonpermissive cells susceptible","complicated receptor-recognition system","kDa glucose-regulated protein","continuous surveillance","need","additional binding target","Betacoronaviruses","dipeptidyl peptidase","membrane","DPP4","regard","analyses"],"language":"en"},

We examined the extent of exhaled air dispersion from a human-patient-simulator during mask ventilation by different groups of healthcare workers and coughing bouts. The simulator was programmed to mimic varying severity of lung injury. Exhaled airflow was marked with tiny smoke particles, and highlighted by laser light-sheet. We determined the normalized exhaled air concentration in the leakage jet plume from the light scattered by smoke particles. Smoke concentration \u226520% was considered as significant exposure. Exhaled air leaked from mask-face interface in the transverse plane was most severe (267 \u00B1 44 mm) with Ambu silicone resuscitator performed by nurses. Dispersion was however similar among anesthesiologists/intensivists, respiratory physicians and medical students using Ambu or Laerdal silicone resuscitator, p = 0.974. The largest dispersion was 860 \u00B1 93 mm during normal coughing effort without tracheal intubation and decreased with worsening coughing efforts. Oro-tracheal suctioning reduced dispersion significantly, p \u003C 0.001, and was more effective when applied continuously. Skills to ensure good fit during mask ventilation are important in preventing air leakage through the mask-face interface.

Like all elements of management, these must be evaluated.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mat\u00EDas-Guiu, Jorge; Porta-Etessam, Jesus; Lopez-Valdes, Eva; Garcia-Morales, Irene; Guerrero-Sol\u00E1, Antonio; Matias-Guiu, Jordi A","journal":"Neurologia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336528/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.04.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["provision of care","provision of neurological care","patient care","epidemic","use of telephone consultations","priority patients","hospital treatments","emergency management","unprecedented decisions","elements of management","specific telephone service","hospitalisation","complementary testing","strategies","functional reorganisation plan","unit","neurology departments","situation of confinement","preparation","different means of operation","epileptic seizures","article","operational decision-making","need","measures","Conclusion","Introduction","COVID"],"language":"en"},

Inhibition of MHV-induced apoptosis by the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK promoted virus production late in infection, indicating that apoptosis could be a host response to limit the production of viral progeny. Activation of the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway was indicated by the activation of caspase-9 and delay of apoptosis by Bcl-2 overexpression. Analyses of the subcellular distribution of cytochrome c, procaspase-9, and Apaf-1 suggested an aberrant apoptosome formation in the vicinity of the mitochondria, which could be a cell type-specific event. An increase in the amount of Fas (APO-1/CD95), caspase-8 activation, caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage, and subsequent translocation of truncated Bid to mitochondria, all of which relate to the Fas-mediated pathway, also occurred in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells, whereas the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, a direct indication of the activation of Fas-mediated pathway, was undetectable. Caspase-8 and Bid activation appeared to be downstream of mitochondria, because Bcl-2 overexpression suppressed both events, suggesting that infected 17Cl-1 cells might have activated a receptor-mediated \u201Ctype II\u201D signaling pathway, in which primary and low levels of receptor-mediated pathway activation lead to the activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway.

MMT is expanding, with backing from multiple government ministries, however, NSEP have received less political support and funding. Methods Semi-structured, serial interviews were conducted with key informants, knowledgeable about China\u0027s harm reduction policies. Concurrent content analysis allowed for revision of the interview guide throughout the data collection process. This was combined with a systematic analysis of official government policy documents on NSEP and MMT, including white papers, legal documents, and policy statements. Findings Early consensus between public security and public health sectors regarding methadone\u0027s dual use in HIV prevention as well as method of drug control created broad institutional support for MMT programmes amongst policy makers. In contrast, NSEP were seen as satisfying only the HIV prevention goals of the public health sector, and were perceived as condoning illicit drug use. Furthermore, NSEP\u0027s roots in China, as an experimental collaboration with international groups, created suspicion regarding its role in China\u0027s drug control policy. NSEP and MMT\u0027s distinct paths to policy development are reflected in the complex and occasionally contradictory nature of China\u0027s harm reduction strategy. Conclusions These discrepancies highlight the need for a more politically sustainable and comprehensive integration of harm reduction projects.

In this study, we conducted a more comprehensive mutational analysis by targeting the entire SeV L protein domain VI, creating twenty-four L mutants, and testing these mutations for their effects on viral mRNA synthesis, cap methylation, viral genome replication and virus growth kinetics. Our analysis identified several residues required for successful cap methylation and virus replication and clearly showed the importance of the K-D-K-E tetrad and glycine-rich motif in the SeV cap methylation.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. METHODS: To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). FINDINGS: Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66\u201397) and 24% (13\u201390) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R(0) and the duration of infectiousness.

Adequate specimen collection is the first crucial step for the correct diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES: The present retrospective study aimed: i) to verify the cell yield obtained from sampling the nasal respiratory tract using mid-turbinate flocked swabs; ii) to evaluate the normalization of viral load, based on cell number; and iii) to compare the kinetics of viral infection obtained with normalized vs non-normalized viral load. STUDY DESIGN: The number of cells were quantified by real-time PCR in residual extract of nasal swabs tested for respiratory viruses detection and stored at \u221280 \u00B0C in a universal transport medium (UTM\u2122). RESULTS: A total of 513 virus-positive and 226 virus-negative samples were analyzed. Overall, a median of 4.42 log(10) \u03B22-microgolubin DNA copy number/ml of UTM(\u2122) (range 1.17\u20137.26) was detected. A significantly higher number of cells was observed in virus-positive as compared to virus-negative samples (4.75 vs 3.76; p \u003C 0.001). Viral loads expressed as log(10) RNA copies/ml of UTM(\u2122) and log(10) RNA copies/median number of cells were compared in virus-positive samples and a strict correlation (r = 0.89, p \u003C 0.001) and agreement (R2 = 0.82) were observed. In addition, infection kinetics were compared using the two methods with a follow-up series of eight episodes of viral infection and the mean difference was -0.57 log(10) (range \u22121.99 to 0.40).

The present study aimed to analyze the diagnosis pattern of childhood malignant diseases using public health data, and to compare this pattern with seasonal viral infection trends. METHOD: Using the open data source of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, we extracted data regarding all patients under 21 years of age and who had any cancer, aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between September 2009 and December 2013. The positive detection rates of 11 viruses was collected from the surveillance data of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and seasonality analysis were conducted with both data. RESULTS: In total, 9085 patients were diagnosed with malignant disease during the study period; there were about 175 new cases per month on average. Monthly stacked time series by year showed an apparent seasonal variation with the highest monthly average in January as 236, and the lowest in September as 120. In winter, significantly more patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma than in other seasons. There was a temporal correlation with the diagnostic trends of several diseases and the prevalence of recent human parainfluenza virus. CONCLUSION: This study tentatively suggests that the diagnosis of childhood malignancy follows a seasonal trend in Korea, and has a possible correlation with viral prevalence in several diseases. Further long-term analysis of epidemiological data is needed to explore possible causality.","publish_time":"2017-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shim, Kyu Seok; Kim, Min Hyung; Shim, Choong Nam; Han, Minkyu; Lim, In Seok; Chae, Soo Ahn; Yun, Sin Weon; Lee, Na Mi; Yi, Dae Yong; Kim, Hyery","journal":"Cancer Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a5faed652d6fb7dc9e86aeee352270c9b0f62d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102810.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187778211730187X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187778211730187X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2017.11.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29127946/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["seasonal trend","public health data","seasonal factors","patients","seasonal viral infection trends","diagnosis of childhood cancer","open data source","diagnosis pattern of childhood malignant diseases","surveillance data of Korea Centers","long-term analysis of epidemiological data","apparent seasonal variation","diagnosis of childhood malignancy","viral prevalence","possible correlation","study period","present study","acute myeloid leukemia","acute lymphoblastic leukemia","highest monthly average","Disease Control","diagnostic trends","seasonality analysis","temporal correlation","possible causality","Health Insurance Review","Monthly stacked time series","prevalence of recent human parainfluenza virus","Prevention","neuroblastoma","viruses","Assessment Service","Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma","aplastic anemia","myelodysplastic syndrome","new cases","positive detection rates","METHOD","studies","years of age","seasons","RESULTS","total","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","winter"],"language":"en"},

Two multi-spanning food vacuole membrane proteins are known, the multidrug resistance protein 1 (PfMDR1) and Chloroquine Resistance Transporter (PfCRT). Both modulate resistance to drugs that act in the food vacuole. To investigate the formation and behaviour of the food vacuole membrane we have generated inducible GFP fusions of chloroquine sensitive and resistant forms of the PfCRT protein. The inducible expression system allowed us to follow newly-induced fusion proteins, and corroborated a previous report of a direct trafficking route from the ER/Golgi to the food vacuole membrane. These parasites also allowed the definition of a food vacuole compartment in ring stage parasites well before haemozoin crystals were apparent, as well as the elucidation of secondary PfCRT-labelled compartments adjacent to the food vacuole in late stage parasites. We demonstrated that in addition to previously demonstrated Brefeldin A sensitivity, the trafficking of PfCRT is disrupted by Dynasore, a non competitive inhibitor of dynamin-mediated vesicle formation. Chloroquine sensitivity was not altered in parasites over-expressing chloroquine resistant or sensitive forms of the PfCRT fused to GFP, suggesting that the PfCRT does not mediate chloroquine transport as a GFP fusion protein.","publish_time":"2012-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ehlgen, Florian; Pham, James S.; de Koning-Ward, Tania; Cowman, Alan F.; Ralph, Stuart A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d0a0fdfcb384b60703d3ea329672f668d7c118e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3374814.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0038781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22719945/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chloroquine Resistance Transporter","ER/Golgi"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["food vacuole compartment","PfCRT protein","trafficking of PfCRT","multi-spanning food vacuole membrane proteins","Chloroquine sensitivity","chloroquine transport","Chloroquine Resistance Transporter","GFP fusion protein","parasites over-expressing chloroquine resistant","inducible GFP fusions of chloroquine sensitive","ring stage parasites","late stage parasites","multidrug resistance protein","sensitive forms","resistant forms","fusion proteins","elucidation of secondary PfCRT-labelled compartments adjacent","demonstrated Brefeldin","direct trafficking route","mediated vesicle formation","anti-malarial drugs","inducible expression system","major function","erythrocytic life stages","PfMDR1","Golgi","previous report","competitive inhibitor of dynamin","target","haemozoin crystals","Plasmodium falciparum","FV","Haemoglobin degradation","Dynasore","definition","behaviour","metabolic pathway","addition"],"language":"en"},

This study assessed its frequency and diagnosis. Methods Three separate studies were conducted in adults presenting with (1) a flu-like illness, (2) a lower respiratory tract infection in the community, and (3) a severe pneumonia requiring hospitalisation. The diagnosis of RSV infection was sought by PCR in all cases, and compared to antigen detection and culture in two studies. Results RSV was identified in 20 (11.7%) of 170 influenza-vaccinated adults suffering from flu-like symptoms. In the 270 cases of non-severe lower respiratory tract illnesses in the community, viruses were identified in 86 (31.8%) cases, with RSV accounting for 13 (4.8%). In the 164 cases of acute bronchitis, a virus was detected in 64 (36.7%) of which 11 (6.3%) were RSV, 37 (21.3%) rhinovirus, 5 influenza viruses A and B, and 12 other viruses. In the 60 cases of infective exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, rhinovirus was detected in 9 (15%) and para-influenza 3 virus in 2 cases. In the 21 acute pneumonia\u0027s, 1 RSV, 1 influenza virus A and 2 rhinovirus cases were detected as well as 1 RSV, 1 parainfluenza 3 viruses and 4 rhinovirus cases in the 11 lower respiratory tract illnesses in patients with pre-existing lung disease. There were overall 19 viral and bacterial associated infections. Finally, in the 51 acute pneumonias hospitalised with respiratory distress syndrome, a virus was identified in 17 (33.3%) cases, including 3 (5.5%) RSV, 6 influenza A, 3 rhinovirus, 2 adenovirus, 2 herpes simplex virus and 1 cytomegalovirus. There were 6 bacterial-associated infections, and 4 were hospital-acquired. All RSV-infected patients were old people and had chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease. Conclusions In adults, RSV is a frequent cause of flu-like symptoms. It can sometimes cause lower respiratory tract illness, which can be severe, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis in such cases. The PCR method is a particularly effective diagnostic test, but as yet is not routinely available.","publish_time":"2004-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freymuth, F.; Vabret, A.; Gouarin, S.; Petitjean, J.; Charbonneau, P.; Lehoux, P.; Galateau-Salle, F.; Tremoli\u00E8res, F.; Carette, M.-F.; Mayaud, C.; Mosnier, A.; Burnouf, L.","journal":"Revue des Maladies Respiratoires","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a01db4ca30f9dde3e4cacd443fe37d2c31b47c74.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842504712334; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842504712334","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tous"],"organizations":["VRS","Le VRS","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus dans","et dans","virus influenza","virus parainfluenza","rhinovirus cases","et aucun VRS","virus est isol\u00E9 dans","virus est d\u00E9tect\u00E9 dans","autres virus","et B","fr\u00E9quence et","virus respiratoire syncytial","herpes simplex virus","respiratory infections","herpes simplex et","influenza viruses","VRS sont \u00E2g\u00E9s et pr\u00E9sentent","d\u00E9tection antig\u00E9nique et","Summary Introduction Respiratory syncytial virus","cas et compar\u00E9e \u00E0","VRS est identifi\u00E9 chez","infections bact\u00E9riennes et virales associ\u00E9es","RSV accounting","Results RSV","est rarement recherch\u00E9 dans","cases of acute bronchitis","diagnosis of RSV infection","para-influenza","RSV-infected patients","culture dans deux enqu\u00EAtes","influenza-vaccinated adults","lower respiratory tract infection","cases of non-severe lower respiratory tract illnesses","bacterial associated infections","bacterial-associated infections","\u00E9t\u00E9 faite par PCR dans tous","fr\u00E9quents syndromes pseudo-grippaux et parfois d\u2019infections respiratoires basses","respiratory distress syndrome","infections bact\u00E9riennes associ\u00E9es dont","il y","cases of infective exacerbations of chronic bronchitis","infections respiratoires basses communautaires sans signes","peuvent \u00EAtre graves et qu\u2019il faut penser \u00E0 rechercher","cas d\u2019infections respiratoires basses sur poumon pathologique","grippe atteints d\u2019un syndrome pseudo-grippal","adultes atteints soit d\u2019un syndrome pseudo-grippal","technique PCR est particuli\u00E8rement efficace mais","risque respiratoire ou cardiaque","pneumopathies infectieuses aigu\u00EBs","trouve","patients infect\u00E9s","Conclusions Chez l\u2019adulte","community","bronchites aigu\u00EBs","acute pneumonias","acute pneumonia\u0027s","pneumopathies infectieuses avec d\u00E9tresse respiratoire hospitalis\u00E9es en r\u00E9animation","d\u2019une infection respiratoire basse communautaire ou hospitalis\u00E9s","disponible en routine","M\u00E9thodes Trois enqu\u00EAtes distinctes ont \u00E9t\u00E9 men\u00E9es chez","Ce travail en \u00E9tudie","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Introduction","cardiac disease","severe pneumonia","separate studies","adultes vaccin\u00E9s contre","bronchites chroniques surinfect\u00E9es","pre-existing lung disease","facteur","au total","gravit\u00E9","une pneumopathie infectieuse grave","old people","CMV","d\u2019origine nosocomiale","antigen detection","diagnostic","R\u00E9sultats","ad\u00E9novirus","adenovirus","Enfin","cytomegalovirus","study","frequency","Methods","hospitalisation","symptoms","frequent cause of flu","RSV","adults","effective diagnostic test","lower respiratory tract illness","PCR method","differential diagnosis","cases","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, and there is a scarcity of information regarding the contribution of the innate immune system, which is the first line of defense against infections. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of advancing age on plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC) function because they are critical in generating a robust antiviral response via the secretion of interferons (IFN). Our results indicate that PDCs from the aged are impaired in their capacity to secrete IFN-I in response to influenza virus and CPG stimulation. Additionally, we observed a severe reduction in the production of IFN-III, which plays an important role in defense against viral infections at respiratory mucosal surfaces. This reduction in IFN-I and IFN-III were a result of age-associated impaired phosphorylation of transcription factor, IRF-7. Furthermore, aged PDCs were observed to be impaired in their capacity to induce perforin and granzyme in CD8 T cells. Comparison of the antigen-presenting capacity of aged PDC with young PDC revealed that PDCs from aged subjects display reduced capacity to induce proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion in CD4 and CD8 T cells as compared with PDCs from young subjects.

MERS-CoV was isolated from the imported patient in China. The envelope (E) protein, a small structural protein of MERS-CoV, plays an important role in host recognition and infection. To identify the conserved epitopes of the E protein, sequence analysis was performed by comparing the E proteins from 42 MERS-CoV strains that triggered severe pandemics and infected humans in the past. To predict the potential B cell epitopes of E protein, three most effective online epitope prediction programs, the ABCpred, Bepipred, and Protean programs from the LaserGene software were used. All the nucleotides and amino acids sequences were obtained from the NCBI Database. One potential epitope with a suitable length (amino acids 58\u201382) was confirmed and predicted to be highly antigenic. This epitope had scores of \u003E0.80 in ABCpred and level 0.35 in Bepipred programs. Due to the lack of X-ray crystal structure of the E protein in the PDB database, the simulated 3D structure of the E protein were also predicted using PHYRE 2 and Pymol programs. In conclusion, using bioinformatics methods, we analyzed the genome sequence of MERS-CoV and identified a potential B-cell epitope of the E protein, which might significantly improve our current MERS vaccine development strategies.","publish_time":"2017-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e55d3a30545e3815093a2d48f44eec77d96b0e91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186043.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28574363/; https://doi.org/10.1109/tcbb.2017.2702588","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCBI Database"],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea","China"],"keyphrases":["E proteins","MERS-CoV strains","potential B cell epitopes of E protein","small structural protein of MERS","potential epitope","genome sequence of MERS","Bepipred programs","potential B-cell epitope","Protean programs","Pymol programs","effective online epitope prediction programs","ABCpred","current MERS vaccine development strategies","amino acids sequences","D structure","PDB database","sequence analysis","conserved epitopes","NCBI Database","lack of X-ray crystal structure","severe pandemics","outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","important role","suitable length","infected humans","host recognition","PHYRE","bioinformatics methods","past","LaserGene software","nucleotides","imported patient","level","South Korea","infections","deaths","end","China","conclusion","scores","envelope"],"language":"en"},

Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which causes pneumonia, requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10% of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome. Several efforts are currently made to find a treatment for COVID-19 patients. So far, several anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs have demonstrated some efficacy on COVID-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in cases series. In COVID-19 patients a pro-inflammatory status with high levels of interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-1 receptor (R)A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 has been demonstrated. Moreover, high levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1 have been observed in patients requiring intensive-care-unit hospitalization. This provided rationale for the use of anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatments for this severe viral infection. Other agents, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine might have a direct anti-viral effect.

Although both live-attenuated and killed-inactivated vaccines against the virus have been available for a decade, PRRSV is still a major problem in the swine industry worldwide. To explore the possibility of producing single-round infectious PRRSV replicon particles as a potential vaccine strategy, we have now generated two necessary components: 1) a stable cell line (BHK/Sinrepl9/PRRSV-N) that constitutively expresses the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus and 2) a PRRSV replicon vector (pBAC/PRRSV/Replicon-AN) with a 177-nucleotide deletion, removing the 3\u2032-half portion of ORF7 in the viral genome, from which the self-replicating propagation-defective replicon RNAs were synthesized in vitro by SP6 polymerase run-off transcription. Transfection of this replicon RNA into N protein-expressing BHK-21 cells led to the secretion of infectious particles that packaged the replicon RNA, albeit with a low production efficiency of 0.4 \u00D7 10(2) to 1.1 \u00D7 10(2) infectious units/ml; the produced particles had only single-round infectivity with no cell-to-cell spread. This trans-complementation system for PRRSV provides a useful platform for studies to define the packaging signals and motifs present within the viral genome and N protein, respectively, and to develop viral replicon-based antiviral vaccines that will stop the infection and spread of this pathogen.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Byung-Hak; Kim, Jeong-Min; Kim, Jin-Kyoung; Jang, Han-Saem; Yun, Gil-Nam; Choi, Eun-Jin; Song, Jae-Young; Yun, Sang-Im; Lee, Young-Min","journal":"J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21d090d4529b9fd46b9c882cb4a57db79616b110.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21717343/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12275-011-1280-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV-N","viral replicon","infectious PRRSV replicon particles","PRRSV replicon vector","N protein","viral genome","viral nucleocapsid","secretion of infectious particles","self-replicating propagation-defective replicon RNAs","produced particles","BHK","infectious units","stable cell line","single-round infectivity","antiviral vaccines","inactivated vaccines","swine industry","respiratory syndrome virus","important swine pathogens","Sinrepl9","motifs present","packaging signals","useful platform","studies","potential vaccine strategy","pBAC","major problem","trans-complementation system","member","decade","cells","SP6 polymerase run-off transcription","half portion of ORF7","infection","low production efficiency","cytoplasm","nucleolus","Transfection","necessary components","Arteriviridae family","possibility","nucleotide deletion"],"language":"en"},

Our previous studies have shown the colocalization of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) with the early endosome marker EEA1 and the inhibition of NDV fusion by the caveolin-phosphorylating drug phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) prompted us to propose that NDV enters the cells via endocytosis. Here we show that the virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion promoted by NDV-F are increased by about 30% after brief exposure to low pH in HeLa and ELL-0 cells but not in NDV receptor- deficient cell lines such as GM95 or Lec1. After a brief low-pH exposure, the percentage of NDV fusion at 29 \u00B0C was similar to that at 37 \u00B0C without acid-pH stimulation, meaning that acid pH would decrease the energetic barrier to enhance fusion. Furthermore, preincubation of cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide led to the inhibition of about 30% of NDV infectivity, suggesting that a population of virus enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, the involvement of the GTPase dynamin in NDV entry is shown as its specific inhibitor, dynasore, also impaired NDV fusion and infectivity. Optimal infection of the host cells was significantly affected by drugs that inhibit endosomal acidification such as concanamycin A, monensin and chloroquine. These results support our hypothesis that entry of NDV into ELL-0 and HeLa cells occurs through the plasma membrane as well as by dynamin- low pH- and receptor- dependent endocytosis.","publish_time":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00E1nchez-Felipe, Lorena; Villar, Enrique; Mu\u00F1oz-Barroso, Isabel","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cec1582311d7646ec984a1291cdbb76173a8b36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094467.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000527361300285X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23994097/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000527361300285X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2013.08.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle Disease Virus","NDV"],"locations":["HeLa"],"keyphrases":["inhibition of NDV fusion","impaired NDV fusion","percentage of NDV fusion","NDV entry","entry of NDV","NDV infectivity","cell-cell fusion","NDV-F","virus-cell fusion","NDV receptor- deficient cell lines","direct fusion","HeLa cells","acid pH","host cells","preincubation of cells","dynamin- low pH","brief low-pH exposure","acid-pH stimulation","receptor- dependent endocytosis","receptor-mediated endocytosis","population of virus","brief exposure","plasma membrane","protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide","specific inhibitor","colocalization of Newcastle Disease Virus","GTPase dynamin","early endosome marker EEA1","caveolin-phosphorylating drug phorbol","viral envelope","myristate","dynasore","concanamycin","GM95","drugs","hypothesis","energetic barrier","endosomal acidification","monensin","acetate","Lec1","Optimal infection","involvement","paramyxoviruses","previous studies","chloroquine","PMA","results"],"language":"en"},

Here, we investigated the sensitivity of VIDISCA-454 with feces-suspensions and serum samples that are positive and that have been quantified for norovirus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1, respectively. The performance of VIDISCA-454 in serum samples was equal to its performance in respiratory material, with an estimated lower threshold of 1,000 viral genome copies. The estimated threshold in feces-suspension is around 200,000 viral genome copies. The decreased sensitivity in feces suspension is mainly due to sequences that share no recognizable identity with known sequences.

In this study, an IBV, CK/CH/2010/JT-1, was isolated from an H120- and 4/91-IBV-vaccinated flock in China. Antisera against vaccine strains H120 and 4/91 could not provide effective protection against CK/CH/2010/JT-1 in virus neutralization assays. CK/CH/2010/JT-1 could cause 43.75% mortality with respiratory and severe renal lesions in inoculated chickens. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene showed that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 and 31 other isolates could be grouped as a new genotypic cluster. Recombination analysis revealed that three recombination events could be found in the genome of CK/CH/2010/JT-1 at positions 24709-365, 17160-19811 and 21136-21770. Whole-genome sequence analysis showed that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 originated from multiple template switches among QX-like, CK/CH/LSC/99I-, tl/CH/LDT3/03- and 4/91-type IBVs. All of these data demonstrated that CK/CH/2010/JT-1 is a new recombinant genotype IBV with high virulence. Our findings suggest that the surveillance of new genotype strains of IBV is very important for developing more effective anti-IBV strategies.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Haisheng; Zhang, Meihong; Tian, Xue; Shao, Hongxia; Qian, Kun; Ye, Jianqiang; Qin, Aijian","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4af91d393a242894fecbf0095c184f2393e46c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28110778/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516304333; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516304333; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.038","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Antisera"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["JT","genome of CK","new recombinant genotype IBV","surveillance of new genotype strains of IBV","IBV-vaccinated flock","effective anti-IBV strategies","Recombination analysis","new genotypic cluster","Phylogenetic analysis","genome sequence analysis","emergence of new infectious bronchitis virus","vaccine strains H120","effective protection","recombination events","virus neutralization assays","severe renal lesions","variants","QX","high virulence","S1 gene","inoculated chickens","mortality","multiple template switches","Antisera","China","tl","LSC","poultry industry","findings","LDT3","isolates","study","data","type IBVs","positions"],"language":"en"},

However, there are no effective preventive measures and the efficacy of hip-preserving surgery is unsatisfactory due to the unclear mechanism of collapse. This study aimed to identify and validate miRNAs differentially expressed in collapse and non-collapse areas of the osteonecrotic femoral head, and to predict the target genes and pathways of these miRNAs. RESULTS: Nine samples passed the quality control test. A total of 2085 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected, among which 433 miRNAs showed differential expression in the T1 group compared to the W1 group; 344 miRNAs showed differential expression in the T2 group compared to the W2 group; 107 miRNAs showed differential expression in the T3 group compared to the W3 group. After combining data from all three patients, 10 miRNAs showed differential expression in the collapse area (T1\u002BT2\u002BT3) compared to the non-collapse area (W1\u002BW2\u002BW3). Compared to the normal area, has-miR-195-5p showed the most significant downregulation. Expression results from RT-PCR revealed that the expression of hsa-miR-195-5p in the collapse area (T1\u002BT2\u002BT3) was significantly lower than that in the non-collapse area (W1\u002BW2\u002BW3) and normal area (Z1\u002BZ2\u002BZ3). 157 genes were perdicted as the target gene of hsa-miR-195-5p. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Femoral heads of three patients (2 males and 1 female) treated by total hip arthroplasty surgery for steroid-induced femoral head osteonecrosis were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Bone tissue samples were obtained from the collapse area (T), non-collapse area (W), and normal area (Z) according to the anatomical structure of osteonecrotic femoral heads. Total RNA was extracted from the samples and the microarray chip was scanned. miRNAs showing differential expressions of more than 1.5-fold were selected and was validated by RT-PCR. TargetScan, mirBase and miRanda bioinformatics software was used to predict target genes and identify possible pathways involving these genes. CONCLUSIONS: miR-195-5p showed the most significant difference in the collapse area of osteonecrotic femoral heads, suggesting that collapse may be related to the downregulation of miR-195-5p.","publish_time":"2017-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Pengfei; Zhai, Pei; Ye, Zengjie; Deng, Peng; Fan, Yueguang; Zeng, Yirong; Pang, Zhihui; Zeng, Jianchun; Li, Jie; Feng, Wenjun","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91eedbad589b474aad1ac0b96957078885146537.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5522094.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28498798/; https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.17333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["miRNAs","Femoral head collapse","collapse area of osteonecrotic femoral heads","normal area","non-collapse areas","unclear mechanism of collapse","W2 group","T1 group","T3 group","T2 group","W1 group","W3 group","expression of hsa","Expression results","target genes","downregulation of miR","treatment regimen of femoral head osteonecrosis","anatomical structure of osteonecrotic femoral heads","differential expressions","patients","total hip arthroplasty surgery","target gene of hsa","RT-PCR","Total RNA","significant downregulation","Bone tissue samples","efficacy of hip","possible pathways","significant difference","steroid","key reference point","miRanda bioinformatics software","female","Z1","TargetScan","mirBase","inclusion","Z2","METHODS","effective preventive measures","quality control test","males","Z3","MATERIALS","BACKGROUND","exclusion criteria","microarray chip","fold","data","CONCLUSIONS","study"],"language":"en"},

Scientists have proposed that many important infections emerged in the period following the advent of agriculture, as a result of newly dense populations and novel proximity to domestic animals that served as reservoirs for novel pathogens. Here, we review genomic evidence regarding pathogen origins, analyzing these data using the epidemiological transition framework. Genetic information has forced us to reconsider how and when many important pathogens emerged; it appears that a number of infections thought to result from contact with domesticated animals arose much earlier than agriculture was adopted.

We investigated the role played by chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the influx of T cells to the cardiac tissue of T. cruzi\u2014infected mice. mRNA and protein for the CCR5 ligands CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 were detected in the hearts of infected mice in association with CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells. There was a high level of CCR5 expression on CD8(\u002B) T cells in the hearts of infected mice. Moreover, CCR5 expression on CD8(\u002B) T cells was positively modulated by T. cruzi infection. CCR5-deficient mice infected with T. cruzi experienced a dramatically inhibited migration of T cells to the heart and were also more susceptible to infection. These results suggest that CCR5 and its ligands play a central role in the control of T cell influx in T. cruzi-infected mice. Knowledge of the mechanisms that trigger and control the migration of cells to the heart in patients with Chagas disease may help in the design of drugs that prevent myocarditis and protect against the development of severe disease.","publish_time":"2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Machado, Fabiana S.; Koyama, Natalia S.; Carregaro, Vanessa; Ferreira, Beatriz R.; Milanezi, Cristiane M.; Teixeira, Mauro M.; Rossi, Marcos A.i; Silva, Jo\u00E3o","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eecc65b84cabf0e7c4adad5a730703430332a5ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109658/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cruzi-infected mice","influx of T cells","migration of cells","hearts of infected mice","CCR5-deficient mice","inhibited migration of T cells","CD8","CCR5 ligands CCL3","Trypanosoma cruzi infection","control of T cell influx","high level of CCR5 expression","central role","pathogenesis of myocarditis","Chagas disease","development of severe disease","cardiac tissue","CCL5","protein","CCL4","patients","association","CD4","design of drugs","chemokine receptor","mRNA","mechanisms","results","Knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Environmental samples were collected simultaneously. Classic and advanced diagnostic techniques were used ResultsSeventy-nine percent (213/271) of new recruits were seronegative for either adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad-4) or adenovirus serotype 7 (Ad-7).

Estimated conditional correlations among Jeju and the three Asian countries are negative over some time periods. This implies that the three Asian countries are substitutes for Jeju in certain specific time horizons. The VEC model is used to investigate the short-run and long-run dynamic relationships and the results reveal that Industrial Production Index and real exchange rates had the positive or negative impact on conditional correlations of tourism demand for these destinations.

In contrast, the amount of retroviral vector produced was unchanged, and that of lentiviral vector was increased less than two-fold. Both free cholesterol and cholesterol ester content in 293-gag-pol producer cells increased with cholesterol addition. In contrast, the phospholipids headgroup composition was essentially unchanged by cholesterol supplementation in 293-gag-pol packaging cells. Based on these results, it is proposed that cholesterol supplementation increases the infectivity of VSV-G-pseudotyped retroviral and lentiviral vectors, possibly by altering the composition of the producer cell membrane where the viral vectors are assembled and bud, and/or by changing the lipid composition of the viral vectors.","publish_time":"2009-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yong; Ott, Christopher J.; Townsend, Kay; Subbaiah, Papasani; Aiyar, Ashok; Miller, William M.","journal":"Biochemical Engineering Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a72ac41caba42455550b1aa98334291d1bcb57f7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f989cc99a5ee83625d58a6fc57887ddb0e8d8cda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2663912.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1369703X08003896; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369703X08003896; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2663912?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cholesterol supplementation","free cholesterol","Cholesterol depletion","lentiviral vectors","cholesterol ester content","vector production","infectivity of retroviral","effects of exogenous cholesterol addition","fold","G-pseudotyped retroviral","virus assembly","infectivity of VSV","lipid composition","production of Molony murine leukemia virus retroviral vector","VSV-G","HIV","gag-pol producer cells","contrast","gag-pol packaging cells","producer cell membrane","phospholipids headgroup composition","vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein","major component of plasma membrane lipid rafts","complex","enveloped viruses","methyl beta cyclodextrin","influenza","study","bud","results"],"language":"en"},

Emergency physicians are at risk for infection during invasive procedures, and the respirators can reduce this risk. This study aimed to determine whether endotracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopes affected protection performances of respirators. Methods. A randomized crossover study of 24 emergency physicians was performed. We performed quantitative fit tests using respirators (cup type, fold type without a valve, and fold type with a valve) before and during intubation. The primary outcome was respirators\u0027 fit factors (FF), and secondary outcomes were acceptable protection (percentage of scores above 100 FF [FF%]). Results. 24 pieces of data were analyzed.

This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods: authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with covid-19; 2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of COVID \u002B units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Lapr\u00E9vote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R","journal":"Encephale","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312567/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France","China"],"keyphrases":["health of patients","mental health care","acute mental disorders","recurrences of mental disorders","population of patients","mental health healthcare system","French mental healthcare","high density of patients","partial closure of mental health community facilities","continuity of psychiatric care","epidemic of emotional disorders","experience of confinement","intensive care units","psychiatric hospitals","psychiatric institution","psychiatric establishments","medical literature","medical teams","medical comorbidities","stress management","daily medical check-ups","risk factors","suicide risk","major issues","barrier measures","close psychological support","hygiene measures","epidemic of coronavirus","pandemic situation","France","general population","support platforms","healthcare systems","compulsory ambulatory care situations","context of major shortage of organizational","specific case-management","types of major vulnerabilities","possibility of home visits","specific training","coping strategies","psychoeducation strategies","relevant results","creation of COVID","infectious diseases","coming days","Family visits","psychological risks inherent","infectious disease specialist","dramatic experience of famine","early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder","social interactions","physical exercise","maintenance of sleep regularity","pulmonary pathologies","narrative review","certain number of structural aspects","new entrants","material","prevalence","regular follow-up","local initiatives","compliance","SARS-CoV epidemy","proposing guidance","crucial role of information","nurse staff","stigmatization","telemedicine","authors","diabetes","internist","quarantine","memory","monitoring","obesity","regions of China","weeks","coordination","prevention of addictions","severe infections","beds","wards","containment","total","concerns","country","human resources","lack of ressources","behavioral troubles","urgent need","reorganization","Private psychiatrists","Methods","addition","Current government plans","dual supervision","World War","directions","elderly","Discussion","psychosocial vulnerability","end of hospitalization","socio-economic difficulties","Objective","article","videoconference"],"language":"en"},

It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung. METHODS: We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight SARS-CoV-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 20 healthy controls. RESULTS: The median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). However, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. The microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. Although how the intra-host variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Zijie; Xiao, Yan; Kang, Lu; Ma, Wentai; Shi, Leisheng; Zhang, Li; Zhou, Zhuo; Yang, Jing; Zhong, Jiaxin; Yang, Donghong; Guo, Li; Zhang, Guoliang; Li, Hongru; Xu, Yu; Chen, Mingwei; Gao, Zhancheng; Wang, Jianwei; Ren, Lili; Li, Mingkun","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6da968668b2379ce81436dcede1332563e54d334.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32129843/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa203","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","transmission of intra-host variants","infected patients","population data","median number of intra-host variants","intra-host variant spreads","distribution of variants","CAP","person","current polymorphism data","current evidence","elevated levels of oral","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","upper respiratory commensal bacteria","metatranscriptome sequencing","limited diversity","pathogens","novel coronavirus","pneumonia","community","viral evolution","virulence","surveillance","consequence","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","genes","clinical changes","healthy controls","infectivity","transmissibility","METHODS","bottleneck","selection","microorganisms","infection","sequences","microbiota","CONCLUSION","individuals","countries","different samples","lung","risk"],"language":"en"},

Design A prospective, observational study. Setting A tertiary university medical center in southern Israel. Patients Twenty-three hospitalizations for PNAE and 217 hospitalizations for NPAE were included in the study. Paired sera were obtained for each of the hospitalizations and were tested serologically for 12 pathogens. Only a significant change in antibody titers or levels was considered diagnostic. Results No significant differences were found between the two groups for any of the parameters related to COPD or comorbidity. The clinical type of the exacerbation was not significantly different between the groups. Compared to NPAE, patients with PNAE had lower Po 2 values at hospital admission (p = 0.004) but higher rates of abrupt onset (p = 0.005), ICU admissions (p = 0.006), invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.01), mortality (p = 0.007), and longer hospital stay (p = 0.001). In 22 PNAE hospitalizations (96%) and in 153 NPAE hospitalizations (71%), at least one infectious etiology was identified (p = 0.001). Mixed infection was found in 13 patients with PNAE (59%) and in 59 patients with NPAE (39%; not significant [NS]). Viral etiology was identified in 18 patients with PNAE (78%) compared with 99 patients with NPAE (46%; p = 0.003).

An atypical etiology was identified in 8 patients with PNAE (35%) and 64 patients with NPAE (30%; NS). Conclusions Community-acquired pneumonia is common among patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of COPD and is generally manifested by more severe clinical and laboratory parameters. In PNAE, compared to NPAE, viral and pneumococcal etiologies are more common, but the rate of atypical pathogens is similar. The therapeutic significance of these findings should be investigated further.","publish_time":"2002-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lieberman, David; Lieberman, Devora; Gelfer, Yevgenia; Varshavsky, Raiesa; Dvoskin, Bella; Leinonen, Maija; Friedman, Maureen G.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2942c5a1038a931a7366ed100b49b6df7188435f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094389.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001236921537793X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001236921537793X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","PNAE","NPAE","ICU"],"locations":["southern Israel"],"keyphrases":["Patients","PNAE hospitalizations","NPAE hospitalizations","infectious etiology","Viral etiology","atypical etiology","Pneumococcal etiology","acute exacerbation of COPD","infectious etiologies of pneumonic acute exacerbations","pneumococcal etiologies","clinical manifestations","clinical type","significant change","significant differences","groups","observational study","Study objective","vs nonpneumonic acute exacerbations","rate of atypical pathogens","hospital admission","longer hospital","laboratory parameters","disease course","lower Po","values","tertiary university medical center","southern Israel","antibody titers","levels","background","higher rates of abrupt onset","pneumonia","invasive mechanical ventilation","Conclusions Community","ICU admissions","therapeutic significance","findings","comorbidity","Mixed infection","mortality","Paired sera"],"language":"en"},

To understand the basis of the ADA response and the mechanism of ADA-mediated neutralization, we performed an in-depth analysis of the B and T cell responses in two patients. By characterizing a large panel of NZM-specific monoclonal antibodies, we found that, in both patients, the response was polyclonal and targeted different epitopes of the NZM idiotype. The neutralizing activity was acquired through somatic mutations and correlated with a slow dissociation rate, a finding that was supported by structural data. Interestingly, in both patients, the analysis of the CD4(\u002B) T cell response, combined with mass spectrometry-based peptidomics, revealed a single immunodominant T cell epitope spanning the FR2-CDR2 region of the NZM light chain. Moreover, a CDR2-modified version of NZM was not recognized by T cells, while retaining binding to \u03B14 integrins. Collectively, our integrated analysis identifies the basis of T-B collaboration that leads to ADA-mediated therapeutic resistance and delineates an approach to design novel deimmunized antibodies for autoimmune disease and cancer treatment.","publish_time":"2019-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cassotta, Antonino; Mikol, Vincent; Bertrand, Thomas; Pouzieux, St\u00E9phanie; Le Parc, Josiane; Ferrari, Paul; Dumas, Jacques; Auer, Michael; Deisenhammer, Florian; Gastaldi, Matteo; Franciotta, Diego; Silacci-Fregni, Chiara; Fernandez Rodriguez, Blanca; Giacchetto-Sasselli, Isabella; Foglierini, Mathilde; Jarrossay, David; Geiger, Roger; Sallusto, Federica; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Piccoli, Luca","journal":"Nat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/327d5fb31ab8eb04ed90082b0ba448675c90208d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6795539.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501610/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-019-0568-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADA","NZM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","basis of T","T cell responses","T cells","NZM idiotype","ADA response","large panel of NZM","NZM light chain","CDR2-modified version of NZM","single immunodominant T cell epitope","specific monoclonal antibodies","mechanism of ADA","\u03B14 integrins","in-depth analysis","integrated analysis","design novel deimmunized antibodies","cases persistent neutralizing anti-drug antibodies","B collaboration","neutralizing activity","mediated neutralization","FR2-CDR2 region","humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody","autoimmune disease","ADAs","approach","targeted different epitopes","mass spectrometry-based peptidomics","finding","CD4","somatic mutations","cancer treatment","slow dissociation rate","relapsing","multiple sclerosis","binding","therapeutic resistance","MS","therapy discontinuation","structural data","Natalizumab"],"language":"en"},

The most recent results of the literature have focused on the Herpes family viruses (HHV-6 and HHV-4/Epstein-Barr virus) and their possible role in the development of multiple sclerosis. Even if no virus has been identified so far as the multiple sclerosis etiological agent, our aim here is to show that some viruses may be responsible for triggering or sustaining neurological diseases. This is particularly the case for Paramyxoviruses, in the late appearance of functional alterations, Picornaviruses, in inducing a breakdown of immune tolerance, epitope spreading and demyelination, and Herpes viruses in inducing T and B lymphocyte activation, T lymphocytes dysregulation and autoimmunity after their reactivation. Therefore, \u201Ccommon\u201D viruses can play a role as potential modulators of the immune and nervous systems which, in the specific context of dysimmunity and genetic susceptibility, stimulate a favorable background to the development of multiple sclerosis.

Aim: We evaluated the impact of an infectious disease specialist (IDS) on implementing an ASP in a resource-limited setting in Korea. Methods: A retrospective study was performed at a NAC hospital between June 2015 and August 2018. An IDS has led an ASP at the hospital since June 2017. We used an interrupted time series analysis to evaluate longitudinal effects of the IDS-led ASP on the amount of antibiotic use and incidence of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) acquisition. Findings: Total antibiotic use changed from 698.82 \u00B1 74.41 to 602.09 \u00B1 69.94 defined daily dose/1000 patient-days (PDs) after intervention. An immediate reduction in the use of carbapenems, glycopeptides, penicillins, and other antibiotics followed the IDS-led ASP. The 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins and carbapenems prescription rates decreased in slope after the intervention. Incidence of MDRO acquisition changed from 1.38, 0.78, and 0.21/1000 PDs to 1.06, 0.15, and 0.32/1000 PDs in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii acquisition immediately decreased following intervention. Conclusion: An IDS can implement a successful ASP by reducing antibiotic consumption and MDRO acquisition at resource-limited NAC hospitals.","publish_time":"2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yong Chan; Kim, Eun Jin; Heo, Jung Yeon; Choi, Young Hwa; Ahn, Jin Young; Jeong, Su Jin; Ku, Nam Su; Choi, Jun Yong; Yeom, Joon-sup; Kim, Ha Yan","journal":"J Clin Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd9937d46e1e7947e28497ca098b76703981d2d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6780603.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm8091293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450837/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAC","MDRO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IDS","successful ASP","multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii acquisition","resistant organism","incidence of multidrug","Incidence of MDRO acquisition","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa","PDs","use of carbapenems","incidence of methicillin","Total antibiotic use","resource-limited NAC hospitals","antibiotic consumption","following intervention","resource-limited setting","carbapenems prescription rates","successful antimicrobial stewardship program","longitudinal effects","patient-days","non-academic community","interrupted time series analysis","generation cephalosporins","infectious disease specialist","slope","glycopeptides","penicillins","antibiotics","defined daily dose","retrospective study","impact","Background","Korea","immediate reduction","insufficient infrastructure","Findings","Methods","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: CT images and medical records of 88 patients with confirmed mild COVID-19 pneumonia, a baseline CT, and at least one follow-up CT were retrospectively reviewed. CT features including lobar distribution and presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and linear opacities were analyzed on per-patient basis during each of five time intervals spanning the 3 weeks after disease onset. Total severity scores were calculated. RESULTS: Of patients, 85.2% had travel history to Wuhan or known contact with infected individuals. The most common symptoms were fever (84.1%) and cough (56.8%). The baseline CT was obtained on average 5 days from symptom onset. Four patients (4.5%) had negative initial CT. Significant differences were found among the time intervals in the proportion of pulmonary lesions that are (1) pure GGO, (2) mixed attenuation, (3) mixed attenuation with linear opacities, (4) consolidation with linear opacities, and (5) pure consolidation. The majority of patients had involvement of \u2265 3 lobes. Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement. The proportions of patients observed to have pure GGO or GGO and consolidation decreased over time while the proportion of patients with GGO and linear opacities increased.

Specifically, emergency medical services (EMS) workers, who are frequently the first professionals to evaluate patients, often do not have advanced notice of patient diagnosis, and have limited time in their national curricula devoted to highly infectious disease (HID) identification and containment. All of these can place them at increased risk. To explore the depth of US EMS practitioners\u0027 HID training and education, a pilot gap analysis survey was distributed to determine where the aforementioned can be bolstered to increase occupational safety. Methods Electronic surveys were distributed to EMS organization members. The survey collected respondent willingness to encounter HID scenarios; current policies and procedures; and levels of knowledge, training, and available resources to address HIDs. Results A total of 2,165 surveys were initiated and collected. Eighty percent of frontline personnel were aware that their agency had an HID standard operating guideline. Almost 85% of respondents correctly marked routes of exposure for select HIDs. More than half of respondents indicated no maximum shift times in personal protective equipment. Discussion This research suggests EMS practitioners could benefit from enhanced industry-specific education, training, and planning on HID mitigation and management.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 371 swabs and organ samples were collected from four types of chicken including layer, Sonali (local), broiler, and broiler breeder under eight districts (Rangpur, Bogura, Tangail, Dhaka, Gazipur, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, and Cumilla) during 2014-2016 in Bangladesh. RESULTS: Out of 371 samples, 65 samples were positive in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for molecular identification of IBV. The overall prevalence was 17.52% recorded and among the selected types of chicken, the highest prevalence of IBV was found in layer that was 42.22% followed by 17.24% in Sonali, 14.93% in broiler breeder, and lowest prevalence was 11.94% in broiler chicken, respectively. Moreover, the prevalence of IBV was recorded highest in aged chicken at 41-60 weeks, which was 54.55% in layer, 27.27% in Sonali, and, afterward, 14.68% was found in broiler breeder, respectively. Frequency of IBV more frequently in winter (22.67%) followed by rainy (15.87%) and summer season (11.58%).

Samples that were found high positive in IBV RT-PCR (Ct value below 30) were subjected to inoculation into chicken egg embryo to observe characteristic changes in chicken embryo. Swabs and organ samples were processed and passaged in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs through allantoic cavity route. IBV virus suspected samples inoculated into chicken egg embryos after 3-5 passages showed dwarfing and curling of the embryos which are characteristic lesions of IBV. Allantoic fluid was collected from all inoculated eggs and performed partial sequencing of S1 gene for three isolates. After sequencing, the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nucleotide sequences of IBV isolates. Two of the isolates are 4/91 IBV and another one matched with QX-like IBV.

We aimed to assess HCWs concerns and anxiety, perceived sufficiency of information, and intended behavior during the recent A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and their associations with psychological distress. METHOD: Between September 1(st )and 30(th), 2009, 469 health-care workers (HCWs) of a tertiary teaching hospital completed a 20-item questionnaire regarding concerns and worries about the new A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, along with Cassileth\u0027s Information Styles Questionnaire (part-I) and the GHQ-28. RESULTS: More than half of the present study\u0027s HCWs (56.7%) reported they were worried about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, their degree of anxiety being moderately high (median 6/9). The most frequent concern was infection of family and friends and the health consequences of the disease (54.9%). The perceived risk of being infected was considered moderately high (median 6/9). Few HCWs (6.6%) had restricted their social contacts and fewer (3.8%) felt isolated by their family members and friends because of their hospital work, while a low percentage (4.3%) indented to take a leave to avoid infection. However, worry and degree of worry were significantly associated with intended absenteeism (p \u003C 0.0005), restriction of social contacts (p \u003C 0.0005), and psychological distress (p = 0.036). Perceived sufficiency of information about several aspects of the A/H1N1 influenza was moderately high, and the overall information about the A/H1N1 influenza was considered clear (median 7.4/9). Also, perceived sufficiency of information for the prognosis of the infection was significantly independently associated with the degree of worry about the pandemic (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of HCWs experienced moderately high anxiety about the pandemic, and their degree of worry was an independent correlate of psychological distress. Since perceived sufficiency of information about the A/H1N1 influenza prognosis was associated with reduced degree of worry, hospital managers and consultation-liaison psychiatry services should try to provide for HCWs\u0027 need for information, in order to offer favourable working conditions in times of extreme distress, such as the current and future pandemics.","publish_time":"2010-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goulia, Panagiota; Mantas, Christos; Dimitroula, Danai; Mantis, Dimitrios; Hyphantis, Thomas","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbd8195f35ba4648be5eb649a3038f7485b7a71e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2990753.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21062471/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-322","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cassileth"],"organizations":["Information Styles Questionnaire"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1 influenza pandemic","perceived sufficiency of information","HCWs concerns","H1N1 influenza prognosis","high anxiety","degree of anxiety","overall information","high levels of psychological distress","reduced degree of worry","families\u0027 health","Health care workers","health-care workers","health consequences","significant proportion of HCWs","present study\u0027s HCWs","perceived risk","independent correlate of psychological distress","Cassileth\u0027s Information Styles Questionnaire","frequent concerns","infection of family","times of extreme distress","hospital managers","hospital work","friends","intended absenteeism","social isolation","restriction of social contacts","tertiary teaching hospital","family members","intended behavior","item questionnaire","intentional absenteeism","previous disease outbreaks","favourable working conditions","consultation-liaison psychiatry services","worries","associations","aspects","half","order","BACKGROUND","SARS outbreak","low percentage","fewer","CONCLUSIONS","future pandemics","RESULTS","leave","METHOD","GHQ"],"language":"en"},

However, little knowledge exists on the ability of porcine IL-22 (pIL-22) to fight against viral infection in the gut. In this study, we found that recombinant mature pIL-22 (mpIL-22) inhibited the infection of multiple diarrhea viruses, including alpha coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV), in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2 (IPEC-J2) cells. mpIL-22 up-regulated the expression of the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin (BD-2), cytokine IL-18 and IFN-\u03BB. Furthermore, we found that mpIL-22 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727 and Tyr705 in IPEC-J2 cells. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by S3I-201 abrogated the antiviral ability of mpIL-22 and the mpIL-22-induced expression of BD-2, IL-18, and IFN-\u03BB. Together, mpIL-22 inhibited the infection of PoRV and enteric coronaviruses, and up-regulated the expression of antimicrobial genes in IPEC-J2, which were mediated by the activation of the STAT3 signal pathway. The significant antiviral activity of IL-22 to curtail multiple enteric diarrhea viruses in vitro suggests that pIL-22 could be a novel therapeutic against devastating viral diarrhea in piglets.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xue, Mei; Zhao, Jing; Ying, Lan; Fu, Fang; Li, Lin; Ma, Yanlong; Shi, Hongyan; Zhang, Jiaoer; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ee3f4f05a87a65b8f18b0a0dfd2c560cdd1166c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113769.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28322925/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216306672; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216306672","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of porcine IL","cytokine IL","antiviral ability of mpIL","infection of multiple diarrhea viruses","IPEC-J2 cells","viral infection","infection of PoRV","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","porcine rotavirus","multiple enteric diarrhea viruses","significant antiviral activity of IL","mucosal microbial infection","devastating viral diarrhea","induced phosphorylation of STAT3","induced expression of BD","intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2","Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation","expression of antimicrobial genes","IFN-\u03BB","STAT3 signal pathway","recombinant mature pIL","enteric coronaviruses","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","mucosal barrier integrity","antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin","alpha coronavirus","PEDV","fighting","essential roles","Tyr705","Ser727","superfamily","TGEV","S3I","piglets","intestine","activation","member","little knowledge","study","Abstract Interleukin","gut"],"language":"en"},

Classically, PD refers to progressive parkinsonism caused by loss of pigmented aminergic brainstem neurons without an identifiable cause, while parkinsonism refers simply to the syndrome of bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and postural reflex impairment. Over nearly two centuries, Parkinson\u0027s clinical description has provided the framework for clinical investigations, including epidemiologic ones. Descriptions of PD were limited to selected clinical settings until the middle of the 20th century. Since then, epidemiologic approaches have been used not only to investigate the population distribution of PD, but also as a way to glean clues as to the cause of this \u201Cidiopathic\u201D disorder. Because PD is relatively infrequent, a large base population must be surveyed to identify sufficient numbers of cases for a study. In some instances, PD cases can be identified through health service rosters within defined geographic areas or in enumerated populations.

On one edge PRRSV has a predilection for immune cells and the disease manifestations can be linked directly to changes in the immune system. PRRSV appears to replicate extensively, if not exclusively, in cells of the immune lineage, notably macrophages; the direct replication of which may lead to immunosuppression, precipitate secondary infection and/or mediate disease. On the other edge, the virus stimulates immunity post-infection that protects an animal from re-infection. A vast array of structural and functionally distinct antibody specific to PRRSV are generated following infection or vaccination. Discrete populations of functional antibodies appear at different times and possibly reflect reactivity to different PRRSV polypeptides. Cell-mediated immune responses specific to PRRSV can be detected in various exposed pigs as well. Thus, the immune system appears to be intimately involved in both the disease process and protection from disease. It is unclear at this state of understanding what immune compartment provides protective immunity. Is it humoral (i.e. antibodies), selective functionally distinct populations of antibodies specific for selected PRRSV polypeptides or is cellular immunity essential for protection, or both. This review will attempt to summarize the current state of knowledge of the complex interaction of the immune system and PRRSV.","publish_time":"1997-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Molitor, T.

Although the disease is now better contained in China, 32 702 cases remain as of March 2, 2020. 10 566 cases and 166 deaths outside of China had been reported as of March 3 (WHO situation report 43), which is a large increase from the 2918 cases and 44 deaths reported on Feb 26 (WHO situation report 37). Rapid progress has been made with diagnostic reagents (eg, nucleic acid and IgM or IgG detection, or both), drug repurposing (eg, remdesivir and chloroquine), and vaccine production. Studies on the biology of viral infection and clinical management of the disease have also been published, some of which have demonstrated that differences in COVID-19 disease prevalence and severity are associated with sex, and smoking is related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), so that might also be a factor. One study (preprint),1 using single-cell sequencing, found that expression of ACE2 was more predominant in Asian men, which might be the reason for the higher prevalence of COVID-19 in this subgroup of patients than in women and patients of other ethnicities. One study of 140 patients with COVID-19 in China,2 found the sex distribution equal; whereas, in a study of critically ill patients,3 more men were affected (67%) than women. In a latest report4 of 1099 patients with COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces in China, 58% of the patients were men. Taken together, these data seem to indicate that there might be a sex predisposition to COVID-19, with men more prone to being affected. This sex predisposition might be associated with the much higher smoking rate in men than in women in China (288 million men vs 12\u00B76 million women were smokers in 2018). Of note, one study (preprint)5 found that although ACE2 expression was not significantly different between Asian and white people, men and women, or subgroups aged older and younger than 60 years, it was significantly higher in current smokers of Asian ethnicity than Asian non-smokers; although no difference was found between smokers and non-smokers who were white. Nonetheless, the current literature does not support smoking as a predisposing factor in men or any subgroup for infection with SARS-CoV-2. In the study by Zhang and colleagues,2 only 1\u00B74% of patients were current smokers, although this number was much higher at 12\u00B76% in the study by Guan and colleagues.4 The relatively small proportion of current smokers in each of these two studies compared with the proportion of male smokers in China (50\u00B75%) are unlikely to be associated with incidence or severity of COVID-19. A trend towards an association was seen between smoking and severity of COVID-19 in the study by Zhang and colleagues2 (11\u00B78% of smokers had non-severe disease vs 16\u00B79% of smokers with severe disease), but it was not significant. Without strong evidence of an association between smoking and prevalence or severity of COVID-19 in Asian men compared with other subgroups, no firm conclusions can be drawn. With more cases being examined from different ethnic and genetic backgrounds worldwide, ACE2 expression variation can be better analysed and compared to establish whether it contributes to susceptibility to COVID-19 across the different subgroups.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Hua","journal":"Lancet Respir Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103991.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221326002030117X; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30117-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171067/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221326002030117X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Zhang"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Asian men","severity of COVID","study","higher prevalence of COVID","China","men vs","women","current smokers of Asian ethnicity","disease prevalence","subgroup of patients","higher expression of ACE2","ill patients","cases","small proportion of current smokers","proportion of male smokers","higher smoking rate","Asian non-smokers","ACE2 expression variation","non-severe disease vs","different subgroups","sex predisposition","outbreak of novel coronavirus disease","current literature","association","SARS-CoV","Studies","preprint","sex distribution equal","Zhang","deaths","situation report","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","white people","predisposing factor","biology of viral infection","receptor","nucleic acid","genetic backgrounds","clinical management","diagnostic reagents","IgG detection","chloroquine","remdesivir","IgM","single-cell sequencing","reason","drug repurposing","years","strong evidence","incidence","hospitals","latest report4","colleagues2","number","differences","vaccine production","Rapid progress","firm conclusions","large increase","provinces","note","Guan","ethnicities","trend","susceptibility","pandemic","data"],"language":"en"},

During the following weeks, at 2 Dutch teaching hospitals, 9 health care workers (HCWs) received a diagnosis of COVID-19, 8 of whom had no history of travel to China or northern Italy, raising the question of whether undetected community circulation was occurring. Objective To determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study was performed in 2 teaching hospitals in the southern part of the Netherlands in March 2020, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers employed in the participating hospitals who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms were asked to voluntarily participate in a screening for infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data analysis was performed in March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was determined by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Results Of 9705 HCWs employed (1722 male [18%]), 1353 (14%) reported fever or respiratory symptoms and were tested. Of those, 86 HCWs (6%) were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median age, 49 years [range, 22-66 years]; 15 [17%] male), representing 1% of all HCWs employed. Most HCWs experienced mild disease, and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Eighty HCWs (93%) met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kluytmans-van den Bergh, Marjolein F Q; Buiting, Anton G M; Pas, Suzan D; Bentvelsen, Robbert G; van den Bijllaardt, Wouter; van Oudheusden, Anne J G; van Rijen, Miranda M L; Verweij, Jaco J; Koopmans, Marion P G; Kluytmans, Jan A J W","journal":"JAMA network open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437576/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.9673","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Netherlands","China"],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","self-reported fever","prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","suspected COVID","confirmed COVID","substantial proportion of HCWs","case definition of fever","coronavirus disease","document symptoms","onset of symptoms","clinical presentation of COVID","known diagnosis of COVID","Dutch case","Dutch teaching hospitals","infection","participating hospitals","health care workers","northern Italy","China","history of travel","recommended case definition","screening","mild disease","years","Netherlands","male","high prevalence of mild clinical presentations","following weeks","early phase of local spread","undetected community circulation","semiquantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","median age","question","oropharyngeal samples","cross-sectional study","Setting","Participants","result of acquisition","range","Structured interviews","inpatient","Main Outcomes","Design","Conclusions","Relevance","Objective","pandemic","shortness of breath","Data analysis","Results","Importance"],"language":"en"},

In addition to cytosolic DNA generated by these viral infections, the metabolic demands of flight cause DNA damage and the release of self-DNA into the cytoplasm. However, whether bats have an altered DNA sensing/defense system to balance high cytosolic DNA levels remains an open question. We demonstrate that bats have a dampened interferon response due to the replacement of the highly conserved serine residue (S358) in STING, an essential adaptor protein in multiple DNA sensing pathways. Reversing this mutation by introducing S358 restored STING functionality, resulting in interferon activation and virus inhibition. Combined with previous reports on bat-specific changes of other DNA sensors such as TLR9, IFI16, and AIM2, our findings shed light on bat adaptation to flight, their long lifespan, and their unique capacity to serve as a virus reservoir.","publish_time":"2018-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Jiazheng; Li, Yang; Shen, Xurui; Goh, Geraldine; Zhu, Yan; Cui, Jie; Wang, Lin-Fa; Shi, Zheng-Li; Zhou, Peng","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/324f06beccf2f18c586037c8206ad8414cca24f1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9c4d7a3ead093fac52d03a26c76897c33b224e38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104992.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312818300416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29478775/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312818300416; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.01.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA sensors","altered DNA sensing","release of self-DNA","bats","high cytosolic DNA levels","multiple DNA sensing pathways","metabolic demands of flight cause DNA damage","S358","longer lifespan","long lifespan","STING functionality","bat adaptation","greater capacity","unique capacity","interferon activation","virus inhibition","virus reservoir","bat-specific changes","dampened interferon response","defense system","essential adaptor protein","replacement","viral infections","findings","IFI16","conserved serine residue","open question","AIM2","previous reports","TLR9","terrestrial mammals","mutation","cytoplasm","variety of viruses","addition"],"language":"en"},

Similarly, several envelope proteins of endogenous retroviruses in human and other mammalian animal genomes (such as syncytin-1 and 2 in human, syncytin-A and B in mouse) were identified and shown to be functional in induction of cell\u2013cell fusion involved in placental development. ZFERV envelope protein (Env) gene appears to be also functional in vivo because it is expressible. After sequence alignment, we found ZFERV Env shares similar structural profiles with syncytin and other type I viral envelopes, especially in the regions of N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR) which were crucial for membrane fusion. We expressed the regions of N \u002B C protein in the ZFERV Env (residues 459\u2013567, including predicted NHR and CHR) to characterize the fusion core structure. We found N \u002B C protein could form a stable coiled-coil trimer that consists of three helical NHR regions forming a central trimeric core, and three helical CHR regions packing into the grooves on the surface of the central core. The structural characterization of the fusion core revealed the possible mechanism of fusion mediated by ZFERV Env. These results gave comprehensive explanation of how the ancient virus infects the zebrafish and integrates into the genome million years ago, and showed a rational clue for discovery of physiological significance (e.g., medicate cell\u2013cell fusion).","publish_time":"2015-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Jian; Zhang, Huaidong; Gong, Rui; Xiao, Gengfu","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb0c95e56ade110ddda73b012490d308624ca47a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092836.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25804638/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X15005276; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.03.081; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X15005276","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHR","ZFERV Env","NHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell fusion","ZFERV envelope protein","fusion core structure","C protein","regions of N","membrane fusion","envelope protein gene","syncytin","helical CHR regions","helical NHR regions","central core","zebrafish genome","possible mechanism of fusion","induction of cell","Abstract Zebrafish endogenous retrovirus","central trimeric core","human","envelope proteins of endogenous retroviruses","unique endogenous retrovirus","predicted NHR","C-terminal heptad repeats","structural characterization","similar structural profiles","intact open reading frames","type","mammalian animal genomes","grooves","stable coiled-coil trimer","discovery of physiological significance","rational clue","comprehensive explanation","ancient virus","viral envelopes","residues","placental development","surface","sequence alignment","results","years","mouse"],"language":"en"},

Abstract John Langdon Down first described this genetic disorder known today as Down syndrome (DS), due to a trisomy of chromosome 21. The frequent appearance of respiratory infections in DS is attributed to structural and functional anomalies of the respiratory system, the presence of congenital heart malformations and IgG deficits. We present three clinical cases of adult DS patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and a review of the literature regarding: epidemiology, prevalence, symptomatology, laboratory and radiographic findings, morbidity, mortality, clinical evolution and the importance of prevention of pneumonia in DS patients. These patients presented symptoms of acute infection of the lower respiratory tract: high fever, scanty productive cough with or without sputum, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, and other atypical symptoms. Chest radiography showed focal inflammatory condensation in the affected lung and bilateral alveolo-interstitial infiltrate. Laboratory tests showed increased values of leukocytes and C-reactive protein, deficiency of IgG and low lymphocyte CD4\u002B. Patients with DS are highly susceptible to lower and higher respiratory tract infection. Community physicians should take exceptional precautions on detecting respiratory symptoms in these patients, since they may result in pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. Presentation may be atypical and the complications may even lead to mortality.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hermida P\u00E9rez, J. A.; Hern\u00E1ndez Guerra, J.

Models of rat lung injury, based on acute exposure to 2 ppm ozone for 3 hr and on exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone for 2 days, were used to determine whether EDU pretreatment of rats protected lungs from oxidant injury. Rats were pretreated with 100 mg/kg body wt EDU by ip administration for 2 days prior to and on the days of ozone exposure. No adverse toxicological effects of EDU pretreatment were observed. Lung superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly enhanced from 636 to 882 U/lung and from 599 to 856 U/lung, respectively. One day following acute exposure (2 ppm for 3 hr), an ozone-induced increase of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from 0.01 to 1.18 million cells/lung was decreased to 0.68 million by EDU pretreatment. No alteration occurred in the degree of lung permeability indicated by increased lavage fluid albumin. EDU pretreatment also significantly decreased ozone-induced increases in PMN recovery after 2 days exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone from 5.54 to 2.12 million cells/lung. However, in this second case, EDU pretreatment reduced the observed ozone damage, indicated by a decrease in lavage fluid albumin and by a decrease in the macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration associated with this length of ozone exposure. The observation that EDU-treated cultured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased SOD and CAT activities identified a potential lung site of EDU interaction. These data demonstrated that although EDU pretreatment appears not to prevent initial ozone damage, it does reduce the infiltration of PMNs and might therefore prevent amplification of the injury associated with this cell type.","publish_time":"1989-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bassett, D.J.P.; Elbon, C.

HAdV-7d, a re-emergent genomic variant, has been recently reported in Asia and the United States after a several-decade absence. However, whether HAdV-7d is associated with higher severity than other types is currently unclear. In this study, the clinical and epidemiological investigation showed that fever, cough, and sore throat were the three most common respiratory symptoms of HAdV infections. HAdV-7 caused longer duration of fever, higher morbidity of tachypnea/dyspnea, pleural effusion, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, consciousness alteration, as well as higher rates of pneumonia, mechanical ventilation and higher fatality rate (28.6%) than other types, particularly HAdV-3 and HAdV-2. The genomes of seven HAdV-7d isolates from mild, severe, and fatal cases were sequenced and highly similar with each other. Surprisingly, two isolates (2011, 2012) had 100% identical genomes with an earlier strain from a fatal ARD outbreak in China (2009), which elucidates the virus origin and confirms the unexpected HAdV genomic conservation and stability. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that L1 52/55-kDa DNA packaging protein may be associated with the higher severity of illness and fatality rate of HAdV-7. Clinicians need to be aware of HAdVs in children with ARD.","publish_time":"2016-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Zhiwu; Zeng, Zhiwei; Zhang, Jing; Pan, Yuxian; Chen, Manjun; Guo, Yonghui; Yu, Nan; Chodosh, James; Fu, Ning; Che, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Qiwei","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/642e03f3b71051b01c77af78f51bb4ef5d00ad08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5110970.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep37216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27848998/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARD"],"locations":["Asia","United States","China"],"keyphrases":["fatality rate of HAdV","unexpected HAdV genomic conservation","higher fatality rate","common respiratory symptoms of HAdV infections","higher severity of illness","higher rates of pneumonia","d isolates","higher morbidity of tachypnea","fatal ARD outbreak","types","fatal cases","aware of HAdVs","identical genomes","longer duration of fever","acute respiratory disease","re-emergent genomic variant","mechanical ventilation","L1","diarrhea","pleural effusion","dyspnea","contagious pathogens","earlier strain","hepatosplenomegaly","epidemiological investigation","cough","consciousness alteration","kDa DNA packaging protein","sore throat","stability","United States","virus origin","study","children","China","decade absence","Phylogenetic analysis","Human adenoviruses","Asia","Clinicians","community"],"language":"en"},

The pH and ionic strength affect the binding affinity of the virus to cells. In this study, we initially investigated the effects of pH (4.0\u201310.0) and metal ions (Fe(2\u002B), Co(2\u002B), Cu(2\u002B), Mg(2\u002B), K(\u002B), and Ca(2\u002B)) on the binding of HAV to oyster digestive cells. The lowest relative binding (RB) of HAV to the cells was found at pH 4.0 and in FeSO(4) solution (64.6% and 68.1%, respectively). To develop an alternative to antibody-dependent immunomagnetic separation prior to detection of HAV using RT-PCR, the binding of HAV to five lectins, peanut agglutinin (PNA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-1) and soybean agglutinin (SBA), was evaluated using ELISAs. SBA showed significantly higher RB to HAV than the other lectins tested. In addition, HAV could be concentrated within 30 min using SBA-linked magnetic bead separation (SMS) prior to the RT-PCR assay. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using SMS combined with RT-PCR to detect HAV at dilutions ranging from 10(\u22121)\u201310(\u22124) of a HAV stock (titer: 10(4) TCID(50)/mL).","publish_time":"2014-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ko, Sang-Mu; Kwon, Joseph; Vaidya, Bipin; Choi, Jong Soon; Lee, Hee-Min; Oh, Myung-Joo; Bae, Hyeun-Jong; Cho, Se-Young; Oh, Kyung-Seo; Kim, Duwoon","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3970137.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599279/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v6031037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAV","SBA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of HAV","detection of HAV","HAV stock","peanut agglutinin","soybean agglutinin","SBA","RT-PCR assay","binding affinity","sensitivity of PCR","digestive cells","infected cells","Dolichos biflorus agglutinin","Helix pomatia agglutinin","Ulex europaeus agglutinin","SMS","lowest relative binding","virus","lectins","effects of pH","detection of hepatitis","antibody-dependent immunomagnetic separation","based methods","higher RB","magnetic bead separation","HPA","DBA","PNA","UEA","alternative","ionic strength","accuracy","feasibility","titer","metal ions","findings","FeSO","dilutions","study","solution","TCID","ELISAs","addition","Ca"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant IBVs based on the Beaudette strain expressing the Beaudette spike protein (Beau-R) or that from the virulent M41 strain (BeauR-M41(S)) were assessed for their potential as prototype vaccines for application to 18-day-old embryos. Pathogenicity was assessed by observing the effect on hatchability, and/or the production of nasal discharge and/or the effects on ciliary activity in the trachea at various time points post hatch. In contrast to commercial IBV vaccines given in ovo, the Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S) strains did not reduce hatchability or cause nasal discharge, and caused minimal damage to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea. The presence of the spike protein from a virulent virus did not increase the pathogenicity of the virus according to the criteria used. Assessment of the BeauR-M41(S) strain for efficacy showed that it protected up to 90% of chicks against challenge with virulent IB virus (M41) in a dose dependent manner. Further egg passage of the BeauR-M41(S) strain (BeauR-M41(S) EP10) did not increase its pathogenicity though it did improve its efficacy, based on serology and protection against a virulent challenge. BeauR-M41(S) EP10 was more efficacious than BeauR-M41(S) protecting more birds against virulent challenge and providing a better serological antibody response. BeauR-M41(S) EP10 induced a serological response similar to that of a commercial vaccine given at day-old though the commercial vaccine provided slightly higher efficacy. These results are promising for the development of embryo safe efficacious IBV vaccines for in ovo application.","publish_time":"2006-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tarpey, I.; Orbell, S.

There are many factors that impact infection during pregnancy, such as the immune system changes during pregnancy, hormonal flux, stress, and the microbiome. We review some of the outcomes of infection during pregnancy, such as preterm birth, chorioamnionitis, meningitis, hydrocephaly, developmental delays, microcephaly, and sepsis. Transmission routes are discussed regarding how a pregnant woman may pass her infection to her fetus. This is followed by examples of infection during pregnancy: bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections. There are many known organisms that are capable of producing similar congenital defects during pregnancy; however, whether these infections share common mechanisms of action is yet to be determined. To protect the health of pregnant women and their offspring, additional research is needed to understand how these intrauterine infections adversely affect pregnancies and/or neonates in order to develop prevention strategies and treatments.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, M.

However, recipients of solid organ transplants (SOT) or haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) are at markedly increased risk for significant morbidity or mortality from these infections. The infections are generally acquired by transmission of large respiratory droplets and can be nosocomial in origin with many documented outbreaks on specialised transplant units. Typically, the infections begin as upper RTIs, with cough or rhinorrhoea predominating. Many will resolve at this stage, but more immunocompromised patients, typically closer in time to their SOT or HSCT, may develop progressive infection to lower RTI or pneumonia. The most common RTI pathogens are influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses. Newer polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic strategies are more sensitive than previous assays, and allow rapid and accurate diagnoses of these infections. These newer assays may also detect emerging pathogens of significance, one of which is human metapneumovirus. While diagnostic techniques have advanced significantly in the past decade, well established and effective specific treatments for these infections remain elusive. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of the common viral RTIs in SOT or HSCT recipients are reviewed, and recommendations presented based on a thorough review of recent literature.","publish_time":"2012-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Ingi; Barton, Todd D.","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fd431caa05459425a6cdfe9b198e0e5314d525b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SOT","Viral respiratory tract infections","common viral RTIs","HSCT recipients","respiratory syncytial viruses","common RTI pathogens","parainfluenza viruses","upper RTIs","mortality","newer assays","occasional significant morbidity","common causes of mild illness","diagnostic strategies","recipients of solid organ transplants","transmission of large respiratory droplets","previous assays","lower RTI","diagnostic techniques","emerging pathogens of significance","haematopoietic stem cell transplants","Newer polymerase chain reaction","immunocompetent children","adults","documented outbreaks","diagnosis","effective specific treatments","progressive infection","origin","time","increased risk","specialised transplant units","immunocompromised patients","past decade","clinical presentation","pneumonia","cough","recommendations","thorough review of recent literature","rhinorrhoea predominating","accurate diagnoses","epidemiology","stage","human metapneumovirus"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiological studies described associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the human gene coding surfactant protein-D (SFTPD) and infectious pulmonary diseases. Studies on twins indicated very strong genetic dependence for serum levels of SP-D. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic influence of sequence variations within the SFTPD gene on the constitutional serum SP-D levels. We sequenced the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR), the coding region and the 3\u2032 region of the SFTPD gene of 32 randomly selected blood donors. Six validated SNPs were genotyped with sequence-specific probes (TaqMan 7000) in 290 German blood donors. Serum SP-D levels were analysed by ELISA, and the association of SFTPD haplotype estimates with the quantitative phenotype serum SP-D level was determined. One single SFTPD haplotype (allele frequency 13.53%) revealed a negative association with serum SP-D levels (P\u003C0.0001). This was confirmed in a second prospectively collected group of blood donors (n=160, P=0.0034). The discovery of a frequent negative variant of the SFTPD gene provides a basis for genetic analysis of the function of SP-D in the resistance against pulmonary infections and inflammatory disorders in humans.","publish_time":"2005-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heidinger, Kathrin; K\u00F6nig, Inke R.; Bohnert, Anette; Kleinsteiber, Anja; Hilgendorff, Anne; Gortner, Ludwig; Ziegler, Andreas; Chakraborty, Trinad; Bein, Gregor","journal":"Immunogenetics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/597c4a14d2cae1912fbc50b443dbc6a86d6263a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100655.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQ00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum levels of SP","SFTPD gene","constitutional serum SP-D levels","function of SP","quantitative phenotype serum SP-D level","single SFTPD haplotype","collectin surfactant protein-D","human gene coding surfactant protein-D","association of SFTPD haplotype estimates","coding region","selected blood donors","group of blood donors","German blood donors","genetic analysis","negative association","untranslated region","genetic influence of sequence variations","strong genetic dependence","pulmonary infections","Epidemiological studies","validated SNPs","single nucleotide polymorphisms","frequent negative variant","sequence-specific probes","infectious pulmonary diseases","associations","resistance","inflammatory disorders","TaqMan","basis","significant role","allele frequency","humans","twins","UTR","ELISA","innate immunity","discovery","study","aim"],"language":"en"},

This informs the development of early warning systems to monitor epidemics and documents the impact of intervention measures. The introduction of digital data sources, and specifically sources available on the internet, has impacted the field of public health surveillance. New opportunities enabled by the underlying availability and scale of internet-based sources (IBSs) have paved the way for novel approaches for disease surveillance, exploration of health communities, and the study of epidemic dynamics. This field and approach is also known as infodemiology or infoveillance. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to assess research findings regarding the application of IBSs for public health surveillance (infodemiology or infoveillance). To achieve this, we have presented a comprehensive systematic literature review with a focus on these sources and their limitations, the diseases targeted, and commonly applied methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted targeting publications between 2012 and 2018 that leveraged IBSs for public health surveillance, outbreak forecasting, disease characterization, diagnosis prediction, content analysis, and health-topic identification. The search results were filtered according to previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Spanning a total of 162 publications, we determined infectious diseases to be the preferred case study (108/162, 66.7%). Of the eight categories of IBSs (search queries, social media, news, discussion forums, websites, web encyclopedia, and online obituaries), search queries and social media were applied in 95.1% (154/162) of the reviewed publications. We also identified limitations in representativeness and biased user age groups, as well as high susceptibility to media events by search queries, social media, and web encyclopedias. CONCLUSIONS: IBSs are a valuable proxy to study illnesses affecting the general population; however, it is important to characterize which diseases are best suited for the available sources; the literature shows that the level of engagement among online platforms can be a potential indicator. There is a necessity to understand the population\u2019s online behavior; in addition, the exploration of health information dissemination and its content is significantly unexplored. With this information, we can understand how the population communicates about illnesses online and, in the process, benefit public health.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barros, Joana M; Duggan, Jim; Rebholz-Schuhmann, Dietrich","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101503.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101503/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozc10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["field of public health surveillance","exploration of health communities","disease surveillance","social media","search queries","available sources","based sources","health-topic identification","exploration of health information dissemination","application of IBSs","categories of IBSs","search results","media events","comprehensive systematic literature review","online obituaries","online platforms","study illnesses","introduction of digital data sources","content analysis","infectious diseases","systematic collection","population\u2019s online behavior","limitations","infodemiology","targeting publications","infoveillance","reviewed publications","applied methods","preferred case study","study of epidemic dynamics","disease characterization","scale of internet","web encyclopedias","interpretation of data","general population","outbreak forecasting","diagnosis prediction","discussion forums","news","websites","high susceptibility","addition","focus","biased user age groups","underlying availability","valuable proxy","epidemics","representativeness","novel approaches","way","level of engagement","research findings","development of early warning systems","defined inclusion","exclusion criteria","New opportunities","potential indicator","necessity","CONCLUSIONS","process","BACKGROUND","impact of intervention measures","total","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Deregulated expression of activin-A has been observed in several human diseases characterized by an immuno-inflammatory and/or tissue remodeling component in their pathophysiology. Various cell types have been recognized as sources of activin-A, and plentiful, occasionally contradicting, functions have been described mainly by in vitro studies. Not surprisingly, both harmful and protective roles have been postulated for activin-A in the context of several disorders. Recent findings have further expanded the functional repertoire of this molecule demonstrating that its ectopic overexpression in mouse airways can cause pathology that simulates faithfully human acute respiratory distress syndrome, a disorder characterized by strong involvement of neutrophils. This finding when considered together with the recent discovery that neutrophils constitute an important source of activin-A in vivo and earlier observations of upregulated activin-A expression in diseases characterized by strong activation of neutrophils may collectively imply a more intimate link between activin-A expression and neutrophil reactivity. In this review, we provide an outline of the functional repertoire of activin-A and suggest that this growth factor functions as a guardian of homeostasis, a modulator of immunity and an orchestrator of tissue repair activities. In this context, a relationship between activin-A and neutrophils may be anything but coincidental.","publish_time":"2013-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sideras, Paschalis; Apostolou, Eirini; Stavropoulos, Athanasios; Sountoulidis, Alexandros; Gavriil, Arianna; Apostolidou, Anastasia; Andreakos, Evangelos","journal":"Semin Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a7d623e03e5b36afb03c72c72a3ac6498ca3060.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101603.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101603/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzEwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sources of activin","Deregulated expression of activin","functional repertoire of activin","important source of activin","earlier observations of upregulated activin","strong activation of neutrophils","strong involvement of neutrophils","human diseases","tissue remodeling component","growth factor functions","recent discovery","context","guardian of homeostasis","orchestrator of tissue repair activities","Recent findings","transforming growth factor \u03B2 super-family","Various cell types","human acute respiratory distress syndrome","key regulator of various fundamental biological processes","pathology","development","member","hormone production","ectopic overexpression","modulator of immunity","mouse airways","capacity","molecule","inflammation","outline","intimate link","pituitary gonadotropes","follicle","protective roles","pathophysiology","neutrophil reactivity","relationship","review","disorders","years","studies"],"language":"en"},

In the CARTO procedure, coil embolization of the drainage vein is performed \u201Cbefore\u201D injection of the sclerosant to replace the use of balloon catheter. In the CARTO-II procedure, coil embolization of the drainage vein was performed \u201Cafter\u201D injection of the sclerosant to prevent migration of the sclerosant. CARTO-II was performed with ethanolamine oleate iopamidol, and the balloon catheter was immediately removed after coil placement. Technical and clinical success rates, number of coils used, presence or absence of severe complications, timing of the procedure, and rate of GV recurrence after the procedure were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: In all patients, GV sclerosis, coil placement and removal of the balloon catheter were successfully completed. The technical success rate was 100%. No patients experienced severe complications such as coil migration or pulmonary embolization. The mean number of metallic coils used per procedure was 3.36. Mean length of the procedure was 132.8 min. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography after CARTO-II confirmed complete variceal thrombosis in all cases. The recurrence rate of GV during follow-up was 2.8% (mean follow-up, 207 days). CONCLUSION: CARTO-II was feasible and safe and could be performed relatively quickly. The number of coils used and the rate of GV recurrence were both low.

HFRS has become a serious public health problem in China. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of HFRS has not been completely clarified. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) and to further explore its potential roles in HFRS. The levels of serum DcR3 were measured by sandwich ELISA. We found serum DcR3 levels increased significantly, which reached peak value during the oliguric phase and in the critical group. Moreover, serum DcR3 levels were closely related to the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) and parameters reflecting kidney injury including BUN, creatinine (Cr) and proteinuria. This study indicates that high levels of serum DcR3 have associations with the disease stages, severity and degree of kidney damage. Meanwhile, our results suggest that DcR3 may play a dual role in HFRS pathogenesis. First, DcR3 is involved in the inflammatory cascade response resulting in capillary permeability and kidney injury in the early stage. Secondly, HTNV infection induced DcR3 expression at the convalescent phase may act as a feed-back mechanism in anti-inflammatory response. Thus, a study of DcR3 is essential for a better understanding of HFRS pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2015-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Yanying; Shi, Dongsha; Li, Man; Dai, Pengfei; Wang, Xiangling; Xie, Ming","journal":"Intern Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddd04a42fdce65bebad91ef38635aefd5a197196.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101622.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzExNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFRS","BUN"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["serum DcR3 levels","study of DcR3","DcR3 expression","high levels of serum DcR3","pathogenesis of HFRS","better understanding of HFRS pathogenesis","kidney injury","levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","inflammatory cascade response","degree of kidney damage","TNF-\u03B1","disease stages","Hemorrhagic fever","oliguric phase","convalescent phase","renal syndrome","anti-inflammatory response","renal failure","acute viral infectious disease","associations","capillary permeability","severity","feed","creatinine","BUN","hemorrhage","parameters","serious public health problem","China","dual role","peak value","early stage","HTNV infection","changes of decoy receptor","mechanism","critical group","sandwich ELISA","proteinuria","potential roles","aim","results"],"language":"en"},

Dyspnea, hypoxemia, and pleuritic chest pain occurred within 24 hours of rituximab administration, and there was no other apparent explanation. Progressive hypoxemia mandated endotracheal intubation 1 week after rituximab administration and led to death 4 weeks after admission. ARDS has been associated with the administration of other monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and OKT3 and is believed to be directly mediated by release of proinflammatory cytokines.

METHODS: Between May 2011 and July 2014, 33 pediatric patients with pneumonia caused by aspiration of oil-based substances were admitted to the Guangzhou Women and Children\u2019s Medical Center, Guangdong, China. Data on the demographics of these patients, as well as that on clinical presentations, imagenological characteristics, history of ingestion, laboratory observations, treatment protocol, response to therapy, BAL findings, and treatment outcomes were collected. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 23 boys (69.7 %) and 10 girls (30.3 %), with ages ranging from 4 mo to 4 y. They were admitted to the hospital 2 h to 13 d after ingesting the oil-based substance. By the time of admission, most patients presented with respiratory distress and other symptoms, including tachypnea (n = 21), cough (n = 25), mild fever (n = 18), progressive dyspnea (n = 12), and pneumorrhagia (n = 5); six patients received mechanical ventilation because of complicated respiratory distress syndrome. The most common laboratory observations were leukocytosis (25 of 33, 75.8 %), neutrophilia (23 of 33, 69.7 %), and anemia (8 of 33, 24.2 %). Serum biochemical examination showed elevated sedimentation rates (24 of 33, 72.7 %), lactate dehydrogenase levels (18 of 33, 54.5 %), and C-reactive protein levels (17 of 33, 51.5 %). The most common finding on computed tomography (CT) scans was areas of consolidation. Within the follow-up duration of 2 wk to 6 mo, all patients with clinical symptoms of ELP experienced remission, and none died. The CT scans of most of the cases were normal by 1 to 3 mo, except for two patients who showed complete improvement 6 mo after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that multiple BALs combined with steroid therapy result in significant improvement of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory parameters in children with acute ELP. Further, some traditional practices may predispose children to ELP, even in the absence of underlying risk factors. Finally, pneumorrhagia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may be the main complications of acute ELP in children.","publish_time":"2016-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Gen; Xie, Yaping; Huang, Li; Tong, Zhijie; Xie, Zhiwei; Yu, Jialu; Wu, Peiqiong","journal":"Indian J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b8cad0ac31932c1146845f0346027d3984e493b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101684.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101684/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ELP","CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["treatment of children","pediatric patients","acute respiratory distress syndrome","main complications of acute ELP","clinical symptoms of ELP experienced remission","steroid therapy","clinical presentations","treatment protocol","treatment outcomes","significant improvement of clinical","common laboratory observations","complicated respiratory distress syndrome","imagenological characteristics of acute Exogenous lipoid pneumonia","laboratory parameters","multiple BALs","CT scans","pneumorrhagia","oil-based substance","aspiration of oil","complete improvement","based substances","common finding","absence of underlying risk factors","lactate dehydrogenase levels","C-reactive protein levels","potential role of multiple bronchoalveolar lavages","response","history of ingestion","Children\u2019s Medical Center","Guangzhou Women","mechanical ventilation","computed tomography","BAL findings","Serum biochemical examination","elevated sedimentation rates","Guangdong","China","wk","areas of consolidation","study group","cases","leukocytosis","traditional practices","mild fever","progressive dyspnea","tachypnea","follow-up duration","time of admission","RESULTS","boys","hospital","Data","demographics","cough","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","girls","neutrophilia","anemia"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, including normal control, model, dexamethasone (DEX, 5 mg/kg), RDN-H (720 mg/kg), RDN-M (360 mg/kg) and RDN-L (180 mg/kg) groups, with 10 rats in each group. Rats were challenged with intravenous injection of LPS 1 h after intraperitoneal treatment with RDN or DEX. At 6 h after LPS challenge, lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected, and the number of inflammatory cells was determined. The right lungs were collected for histopathologic examination, measurement of gene and protein expressions, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities. RESULTS: In vivo pretreatment of RDN (360, 720 mg/kg) significantly reduced the weight of wet to dry (W/D) ratio of lung, protein content in BALF, and led to remarkable attenuation of LPS-induced histopathological changes in the lungs. Meanwhile, RDN enormously decreased BALF total inflammatory cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage cell numbers. Moreover, RDN increased SOD activity, inhibited MPO activity, alleviated LPS-induced tumor neurosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in lung tissues. Furthermore, RDN (720 mg/kg) efficiently weakened nuclear factorkappa B (NF-\u03BAB) gene and protein expression. CONCLUSION: Anti-inflammatory effects of RDN was demonstrated to be preventing pulmonary neutrophil infiltration, lowering MPO activity, TNF-\u03B1 and iNOS gene expression by inhibiting NF-\u03BAB activity in LPS-induced ALI.","publish_time":"2014-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Lu-ping; Xiao, Wei; Li, Yi-fang; Li, Hai-bo; Wang, Zhen-zhong; Yao, Xin-sheng; Kurihara, Hiroshi; He, Rong-rong","journal":"Chin J Integr Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f817ace8040af6df27931b9aeeb615fbddcb0284.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101712/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LPS","RDN","DEX","BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RDN-H","pretreatment of RDN","Anti-inflammatory effects of RDN","RDN increased SOD activity","LPS-induced ALI","LPS challenge","lung tissues","intravenous injection of LPS","inhibited MPO activity","NF-\u03BAB activity","iNOS gene expression","remarkable attenuation of LPS","TNF-\u03B1","ratio of lung","alleviated LPS-induced tumor neurosis factor-\u03B1","measurement of gene","protein expressions","acute lung injury","protein content","groups","decreased BALF total inflammatory cells","male Sprague-Dawley rats","number of inflammatory cells","protective effects of Reduning Injection","right lungs","pulmonary neutrophil infiltration","inducible nitric oxide synthase","superoxide dismutase","\u70ED\u6BD2\u5B81\u6CE8\u5C04\u6DB2","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","histopathologic examination","intraperitoneal treatment","model","lipopolysaccharide","myeloperoxidase","patent Chinese medicine","normal control","histopathological changes","nuclear factorkappa B","dexamethasone","macrophage cell numbers","underlying mechanisms of action","METHODS","CONCLUSION","weight of wet","OBJECTIVE","activities","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Immature female Wistar rats (25 days old) were injected subcutaneously (SC) with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, 20 IU in 0.2 mL) or vehicle 48 hours before euthanasia. Tissue distributions of Ang-(1\u20137), Mas receptor, and ACE2 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, along with angiotensin II (Ang II) localization, while the mRNA expression levels of Mas receptor and ACE2 were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, we determined the activity of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), and ACE by fluorometric assays. After eCG treatment, we found strong immunoreactivity for Ang-(1\u20137) and Mas primarily in the theca-interstitial cells, while Ang II appeared in the granulosa but not in the thecal layer. Equine chorionic gonadotropin treatment increased Mas and ACE2 mRNA expression compared with control animals (3.3- and 2.1-fold increase, respectively; P \u003C .05). Angiotensin-converting enzyme and NEP activities were lower, while PEP activity was higher in the eCG-treated rats (P \u003C .05). These data show gonadotropin-induced changes in the ovarian expression of Ang-(1\u20137), Mas receptor, and ACE2. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) branch formed by ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas, fully expressed in the rat ovary and regulated by gonadotropic hormones, could play a role in the ovarian physiology.","publish_time":"2009-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pereira, Virg\u00EDnia M.; Reis, Fernando M.; Santos, Robson A.

The commercial potential of biomedicines produced by molecular farming has dramatically improved due to the success of an experimental drug called ZMapp, which has immunological activity in Ebola patients. A cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies was produced in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants (Chen and Davis 2016). At present, very few drugs made by this technology have been approved by worldwide authorities such as the U.S. FDA.

In recent years, leading researchers on molecular farming have given more priority to the area of animal-free therapeutic proteins such as parenteral and oral vaccines. Although plant-based platforms have considerable advantages over traditional systems such as bacterial and animal systems, there are several obstacles to commercial-scale production, especially with regards to improving the quality and quantity of plant-produced biologics and industrial materials.

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10(6) PbANKA-infected red blood cells. The lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) were harvested at days 5, 10, 15, and 20 post infections (p.i.). The grade of lung injury was histopathologically evaluated. Tim-3- and Gal-9-positive cells in the lungs and MLNs were stained by immunohistochemistry, and the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of Tim-3, Gal-9, and related cytokines were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analyses were performed from days 18 to 20 p.i.

In conclusion, our data suggested that Tim-3/Gal-9 may play a role in PbANKA-induced ALI.","publish_time":"2015-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jinfeng; Xiao, Siyu; Huang, Shiguang; Pei, Fuquan; Lu, Fangli","journal":"Parasitol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d180f92211f288eaa76d6ee6404f5ba094677f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101834.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101834/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tim"],"organizations":["ALI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lungs","PbANKA-infected mice","expressions of Tim","numbers of Gal","MLNs","PbANKA-induced ALI","PbANKA-infected red blood cells","Kunming outbred mice","acute lung injury","positive cells","development of ALI","grade of lung injury","days","mechanisms of lung damage","severe malaria","mRNA levels","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","cerebral edema","Plasmodium berghei ANKA","mucin domain","qRT-PCR","profiles of T cell immunoglobulin","analyses","relevant parasitic disease","messenger RNA","related cytokines","total protein level","Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","multiple organ dysfunctions","times","BALFs","mediastinal lymph nodes","immunohistochemistry","role","results","study","pathological severities","ligand galecin","conclusion","data","post infections"],"language":"en"},

Despite the frequent deployment of HFOV, randomized controlled trials remain elusive and currently there are no pediatric trials looking at its use. Our longitudinal study analyzed the predictive clinical outcome of HFOV in pediatric AHRF given disease-specific morbidity. METHODS: A retrospective 8-year review on pediatric intensive care unit admissions with AHRF ventilated by HFOV was performed. Primary outcomes included survival, morbidity, length of stay (LOS), and factors associated with survival or mortality. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients underwent HFOV with a 66 % overall survival rate. Survivors had a greater LOS than nonsurvivors (p = 0.001). Mortality odds ratio (OR) for patients without bronchiolitis was 8.19 (CI = 1.02, 65.43), and without pneumonia it was 3.07 (CI = 1.12, 8.39). A lower oxygenation index (OI) after HFOV commencement and at subsequent time points analyzed predicted survival. After 24 h, mortality was associated with an OI \u003E 35 [OR = 31.11 (CI = 3.25, 297.98)]. Sepsis-related mortality was associated with a higher baseline FiO(2) (0.88 vs. 0.65), higher OI (42 vs. 22), and augmented metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.25 vs. 7.32) evaluated 4 h on HFOV (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation may be safely utilized. It has a 66 % overall survival rate in pediatric AHRF of various etiologies. Patients with morbidity limited to the respiratory system and optimized oxygenation indices are most likely to survive on HFOV.","publish_time":"2012-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Babbitt, Christopher J.; Cooper, Michael C.; Nussbaum, Eliezer; Liao, Eileen; Levine, Glenn K.; Randhawa, Inderpal S.","journal":"Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d83d4475bac329175fab4a6fd7af7cbb13fc9ada.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101837.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101837/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzIwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFOV","AHRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HFOV commencement","frequent deployment of HFOV","pediatric trials","predicted survival","overall survival rate","patients","predictive clinical outcome of HFOV","pediatric AHRF of various etiologies","high-frequency oscillatory ventilation","Mortality odds ratio","Sepsis-related mortality","disease-specific morbidity","pediatric intensive care unit admissions","respiratory system","greater LOS","randomized controlled trials","optimized oxygenation indices","lower oxygenation index","higher baseline FiO","acute hypoxemic respiratory failure","year review","Multiple ventilatory strategies","subsequent time points","length of stay","longitudinal study","BACKGROUND","nonsurvivors","children","CONCLUSION","factors","Primary outcomes","augmented metabolic acidosis","pH","total","METHODS","RESULTS","use","bronchiolitis","pneumonia"],"language":"en"},

The myocardium and resting skeletal muscle utilise long-chain fatty acids as a major source of energy. Inherited disorders affecting fatty acid oxidation seriously compromise the function of muscle and other highly energy-dependent tissues such as brain, nerve, heart, kidney and liver. Such defects encompass a wide spectrum of clinical disease, presenting in the neonatal period or infancy with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, liver dysfunction, hyperammonaemia and often cardiac dysfunction. In older children, adolescence or adults there is often exercise intolerance with episodic myalgia or rhabdomyolysis in association with prolonged aerobic exercise or other exacerbating factors. Some disorders are particularly associated with toxic metabolites that may contribute to encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, axonopathy and pigmentary retinopathy. The phenotypic diversity encountered in defects of fat oxidation is partly explained by genotype/phenotype correlation and certain identifiable environmental factors but there remain many unresolved questions regarding the complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences that dictate phenotypic expression. It is becoming increasingly clear that the view that most inherited disorders are purely monogenic diseases is a naive concept. In the future our approach to understanding the phenotypic diversity and management of patients will be more realistically achieved from a polygenic perspective.","publish_time":"2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olpin, Simon E","journal":"J Inherit Metab Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ba36119727d9c91e74309856073b732caa25556.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101856.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101856/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzIxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fatty acid oxidation","phenotypic diversity","Inherited disorders","chain fatty acids","liver dysfunction","prolonged aerobic exercise","defects of fat oxidation","phenotypic expression","major source of energy","certain identifiable environmental factors","environmental influences","major fuel","exacerbating factors","cardiac dysfunction","function of muscle","skeletal muscle","energy-dependent tissues","recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycaemic encephalopathy","rhabdomyolysis","neonatal period","brain","nerve","infancy","genotype","phenotype correlation","association","hyperammonaemia","fasting","complex interaction of genetic","unresolved questions","monogenic diseases","body","episodic myalgia","wide spectrum of clinical disease","adults","intolerance","polyneuropathy","axonopathy","heart","kidney","pigmentary retinopathy","older children","adolescence","naive concept","approach","view","management of patients","toxic metabolites","stress"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we examine the role of podocytic angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R) and prorenin receptor (PRR) in podocytic apoptosis in IgAN. Polymeric IgA (pIgA) was isolated from patients with IgAN and healthy controls. Conditioned media were prepared from growth arrested human mesangial cells (HMC) incubated with pIgA from patients with IgAN (IgA-HMC media) or healthy controls (Ctl-HMC media). A human podocyte cell line was used as a model to examine the regulation of the expression of AT1R, PRR, TNF-\u03B1 and CTGF by IgA-HMC media. Podocytic nephrin expression, annexin V binding and caspase 3 activity were used as the functional readout of podocytic apoptosis. IgA-HMC media had no effect on AngII release by podocytes. IgA-HMC media significantly up-regulated the expression of AT1R and PRR, down-regulated nephrin expression and induced apoptosis in podocytes. Mono-blockade of AT1R, PRR, TNF-\u03B1 or CTGF partially reduced podocytic apoptosis. IgA-HMC media activated NF\u03BAB, notch1 and HEY1 expression by podocytes and dual blockade of AT1R with PRR, or anti-TNF-\u03B1 with anti-CTGF, effectively rescued the podocytic apoptosis induced by IgA-HMC media. Our data suggests that pIgA-activated HMC up-regulates the expression of AT1R and PRR expression by podocytes and the associated activation of NF\u03BAB and notch signalling pathways play an essential role in the podocytic apoptosis induced by glomerulo-podocytic communication in IgAN. Simultaneously targeting the AT1R and PRR could be a potential therapeutic option to reduce the podocytic injury in IgAN.

The brain is critically dependent on oxygen delivery, and reduced brain tissue oxygen tension (P(bt)O(2)) may result in poor outcome after brain injury. We tested the hypothesis that obesity is associated with compromised P(bt)O(2) after severe brain injury. METHODS: Patients with severe brain injury (GCS score \u2264 8) who underwent continuous P(bt)O(2) monitoring were retrospectively identified from a prospective single-center database. Patients, were classified by body mass index (BMI = weight (kg)/m(2)) and were included if they were obese (BMI \u2265 30) or non-obese (BMI = \u003C30). RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients (mean age 46.4 \u00B1 17.0 years) were included. Mean daily P(bt)O(2) was 25.8 (9.6) mmHg for the 28 obese and 31.8 (12.3) mmHg for the 41 non-obese patients (P = 0.03).

But the association between the level of DC-SIGNR and lung cancer is unknown. To investigate the clinical diagnostic significance of DC-SIGNR in lung cancer, we investigated serum DC-SIGNR levels in 173 lung cancer patients and 134 healthy individuals using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed that serum DC-SIGNR levels in lung cancer patients were lower than that in healthy controls (P = 0.0003). A cut-off value of 3.8998 ng/L for DC-SIGNR predicted the presence of lung cancer with 78.03 % sensitivity and 49.25 % specificity (area under the curve = 0.6212, P = 0.0003). Strikingly, serum DC-SIGNR levels were significantly higher in lung cancer patients with brain metastasis compared to those without metastasis (P = 0.0283). Moreover, the serum concentrations of DC-SIGNR in lung cancer patients also correlated significantly with serum natural killer cells percentage (P = 0.0017). In addition, immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated that the expression of DC-SIGNR in lung tissues of 31 lung cancer patients and 13 tuberculosis patients was significantly lower than that in 18 normal lung tissues (P = 0.0418, 0.0289), and there is no significant difference between tuberculosis tissues and lung cancer tissues (P = 0.2696). These results suggest that DC-SIGNR maybe a promising biological molecule that has the potential for clinical research of lung cancer, whereas its underlying roles are needed to be investigated in further studies.

Clinical assessment tools have poor sensitivity for predicting clinical outcomes. Molecular measurements of bacterial load correlate closely with clinical outcome but require specialist facilities and expertise. This study describes how routine blood culture testing can estimate bacterial load and predict clinical outcome for invasive pneumococcal pneumonia. Between December 2009 to March 2014, clinical and laboratory data were collected for 50 patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteraemia secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. Fluorescence rates (FR) were calculated from growth curves generated by BACTEC blood culture analysers by dividing change in fluorescence units (FU), measured at the first point of detectable fluorescence and at the point of automated BACTEC positivity, by time in hours. The mean age of the patients was 70.6 years (49.6\u201386.3). Forty patients survived invasive pneumococcal disease and ten patients died. These two groups did not significantly differ by demographic or clinical characteristics. The mean FR for the non-survival group (3.62 \u00D7 10(\u22123) FU/h) was significantly higher (p \u003C 0.001) than that of the survival group (1.73 \u00D7 10(\u22123) FU/h). FR did not vary by serotype. We determined that an FR of 2.59 \u00D7 10(\u22123) FU/h might represent a useful threshold for predicting high mortality risk with a sensitivity of 91 % and a specificity of 97 %. Our FR calculation uses cheap and accessible routine blood culture techniques to predict mortality in a small retrospective cohort study. In patients admitted to hospital with pneumococcal bacteraemia and, potentially, other organisms, this single tool could guide early escalation of clinical care.","publish_time":"2015-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fink, D.; Barakat, F.; Ellis, J.; Lakra, C.; Bodhani, R.; Creer, D.; Elsaghier, A.","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8eebd965fed3ef7338717d848a4f30ff7a06ebc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102030.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102030/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","clinical outcomes","clinical characteristics","mean FR","Invasive pneumococcal pneumonia","Clinical assessment tools","pneumococcal bacteraemia","FR calculation","invasive pneumococcal disease","early escalation of clinical care","Fluorescence rates","high rates of mortality","routine blood culture testing","BACTEC blood culture analysers","accessible routine blood culture techniques","high mortality risk","fluorescence units","point of detectable fluorescence","non-survival group","poor sensitivity","point of automated BACTEC positivity","mean age","Molecular measurements of bacterial load correlate","Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteraemia secondary","small retrospective cohort study","change","useful threshold","growth curves","community","single tool","time","specialist facilities","hours","organisms","expertise","demographic","laboratory data","hospital","years","groups","specificity","serotype"],"language":"en"},

New therapeutics are desperately needed, especially those that target the underlying causes and prevent disease progression. Although asthma and COPD have distinct etiologies, both are associated with reduced airflow caused by excess infiltration of inflammatory cells into healthy lung tissues. As selectin-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium is a key early event in the initiation of the inflammatory response, selectin inhibition is thought to be a good target for therapeutic intervention. Three known selectins are expressed in distinct subsets of cells: P-selectin is presented on the surface of activated platelets and endothelial cells, L-selectin is constitutively expressed on leukocytes, and E-selectin synthesis is upregulated in activated endothelial cells. They mediate cell-cell adhesion in the shear flow of the bloodstream via specialized interactions with clusters of oligosaccharides presented on cell surface glycopeptide ligands. The role of selectin-ligand interactions in the inflammatory response has been demonstrated in various animal models, prompting considerable attention from the pharmaceutical industry. Drug discovery efforts have yielded many different classes of selectin inhibitors, including soluble protein ligands, antibodies, oligosaccharides and small molecules. Although many selectin inhibitors have shown activity in preclinical models, clinical progress of selectin-directed therapies has been slow. Early approaches employed carbohydrate-based inhibitors to mimic the natural ligand sialyl Lewis X; however, these compounds proved challenging to develop. Cytel\u2019s CY 1503, a complex oligosaccharide, progressed to phase II/III trials for reperfusion injury, but further development was halted when it failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Two protein-based selectin inhibitors have reached phase II development. These included Wyeth\u2019s recombinant soluble P-selectin ligand, TSI (PSGL-1), which was discontinued after disappointing results in myocardial infarction trials and Protein Design Labs\u2019 humanized anti-L-selectin monoclonal antibody, which is currently in development for trauma. Bimosiamose, discovered by Encysive Pharmaceutical and presently being developed by Revotar Biopharmaceuticals, is an 863 g/mol molecular weight dimer with minimal carbohydrate content and is, to date, the leading selectin inhibitor in clinical development. This compound has shown promise in a phase Ha \u2018proof of concept\u2019 trial in patients with asthma, reducing airway recruitment of eosinophils after intravenous administration. Further clinical development of an inhaled formulation is underway. Despite a significant need for new therapeutics, selectin inhibitors have not yet been explored for the treatment of COPD. Bimosiamose represents an important proof of principle, and hopefully continued success will spark renewed interest in selectin-directed therapeutics for respiratory diseases.","publish_time":"2012-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romano, Suzanne J.","journal":"Treat Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a14374b4cc52924cfe67845c94d97f118f43856.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102115/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzMxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["COPD","Protein Design Labs","Encysive Pharmaceutical"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selectin inhibition","role of selectin","clinical progress of selectin","protein-based selectin inhibitors","selectin monoclonal antibody","leading selectin inhibitor","E-selectin synthesis","different classes of selectin inhibitors","selectin-mediated adhesion of leukocytes","clinical development","included Wyeth\u2019s recombinant soluble P-selectin ligand","inflammatory response","carbohydrate-based inhibitors","Asthma","endothelial cells","cell-cell adhesion","ligand interactions","excess infiltration of inflammatory cells","New therapeutics","clinical efficacy","soluble protein ligands","distinct subsets of cells","chronic inflammatory conditions","cell surface glycopeptide ligands","patients","phase Ha","Bimosiamose","treatment of COPD","surface of activated platelets","clusters of oligosaccharides","preclinical models","proof of concept","specialized interactions","Early approaches","distinct etiologies","pharmaceutical industry","Encysive Pharmaceutical","good target","Protein Design Labs\u2019 humanized anti-","natural ligand sialyl Lewis X","myocardial infarction trials","minimal carbohydrate content","various animal models","key early event","important proof of principle","mol molecular weight dimer","vascular endothelium","considerable attention","shear flow","antibodies","initiation","activity","airway recruitment of eosinophils","bloodstream","healthy lung tissues","date","TSI","disappointing results","hundreds of millions","significant need","intravenous administration","reduced airflow","continued success","promise","inhaled formulation","therapies","Drug discovery efforts","small molecules","Cytel\u2019s CY","complex oligosaccharide","underlying causes","disease progression","compounds","therapeutic intervention","known selectins","reperfusion injury","respiratory diseases","PSGL","Revotar Biopharmaceuticals","trauma"],"language":"en"},

A higher level of PVB19 DNA has been observed in various tissues from cases of disease than in controls. Simultaneously, equal detection of PVB19 DNA has been shown in both cases and controls. Thus, it has become fundamental to study PVB19 DNA persistence in tissues that are unaffected by disease.

In many instances, a careful evaluation of the tissue reactions will result in a specific diagnosis or at least in a narrow range of differentials, which will assist the clinician to arrive at a definite diagnosis, when combining our interpretation with the clinical presentation of the patient and high-resolution computed tomography. In this review, we will exclude granulomatous pneumonias as well as vascular diseases (primary arterial pulmonary hypertension and vasculitis); however, pulmonary hypertension as a complication of interstitial processes will be mentioned. Few entities of pneumoconiosis presenting as an interstitial process will be included, whereas those with granulomatous reactions will be excluded. Drug reactions will be touched on within interstitial pneumonias, but will not be a major focus. In contrast to the present-day preferred descriptive pattern recognition, it is the author\u2019s strong belief that pathologists should always try to dig out the etiology from a tissue specimen and not being satisfied with just a pattern description. It is the difference of sorting tissue reactions into boxes by their main pattern, without recognizing minor or minute reactions, which sometimes will guide one to the correct etiology-oriented interpretation. In the author\u2019s personal perspective, tissue reactions can even be sorted by their timeliness, and therefore, ordered by the time of appearance, providing an insight into the pathogenesis and course of a disease. Also, underlying immune mechanisms will be discussed briefly as far as they are essential to understand the disease.

Today the most common cause for this is the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). There have been some remarkable advances recently in the development of new drug regimens to combat this otherwise fatal infection. Although cotripoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is still the drug of first choice it cannot be tolerated by a significant proportion of patients, and therapies such as pentamidine (pentamidine-isethionate) [intravenous or nebulised], dapsone-trimethoprim, eflornithine (DFMO; difluoromethylornithine), trimetrexate, and clindamycin-primaquine are finding therapeutic niches. The major advantage in these other agents is not improved efficacy but different toxicity profiles, enabling therapy to be most appropriately tailored to individual patients\u2019 conditions. Although the majority of patients should now survive an attack of PCP, relapses will occur if prophylaxis is not used: There is also the capacity to predict accurately which patients are at risk for this pneumonia and prevent it through the use of chemoprophylaxis. These advances in the treatment and prevention of PCP, together with anti-retro viral therapy, mean that this is an area of AIDS management that has resulted in improved long term survival.","publish_time":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Don; Gazzard, Brian G.","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a4e2064654e3c5b32580726f5d697c23a703f60.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102186/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumocystis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevention of PCP","attack of PCP","majority of patients","significant proportion of patients","improved efficacy","dapsone-trimethoprim","pentamidine-isethionate","trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole","remarkable advances","area of AIDS management","Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia","improved long term survival","development of new drug regimens","anti-retro viral therapy","different toxicity profiles","agents","difluoromethylornithine","DFMO","therapies","clindamycin-primaquine","defect","trimetrexate","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome","eflornithine","cell-mediated immunity","therapeutic niches","relapses","people","treatment","common cause","fatal infection","individual patients\u2019 conditions","major advantage","cotripoxazole","risk","use of chemoprophylaxis","choice","capacity"],"language":"en"},

Dysregulation of homeostasis can lead to inflammation of the colon (colitis), which can cause life-threatening enfeeblement or even cancer. Animal models are valuable surrogates in deciphering the pathology behind such human conditions and for screening of putative therapeutic targets or treatment paradigms. However, development of disease models can be time-consuming and technical demanding, which might hamper their application-value. In this study, we genetically disrupted the mouse Ace2 gene by direct injection of in vitro transcribed mRNA coding for transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) into the cytoplasm of outbred Kunming mouse zygotes. Consequently, somatic mutations were induced with an efficiency of 57 %, of which 39 % were frameshift mutations. Moreover, all modifications were stably transferred during germline transmission. In Ace2-knockout male mice (Ace2 (\u2212/y)), we observed severe chemical induced colitis, characterized by considerable weight loss, diarrhea and a shortened colon length. Histologically, Ace2 mutations resulted in the infiltration of leukocytes and the overt damage of the intestinal mucosal barrier. In addition, we detected an increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the colon tissue of Ace2 (\u2212/y) mice. Collectively, the data indicate that high targeting efficiency and heritability can be achieved in an outbred mouse model by zygote injection of TALEN mRNA. Furthermore, the generated Ace2 (\u2212/y) mice display phenotypic traits reminiscent of colitis and we anticipate that such mice can be of value in studies of the intestinal microbiome or fecal transplantation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May and mid-November 2009, 3,649 patients with suspected H1N1 influenza presented to our hospital. Our study population comprised 167 (91 male, 76 female patients, age range 11 months to 82 years; mean age 29 years) out of 1,896 patients with throat swab positive for H1N1 and clinical and laboratory findings indicative of viral influenza. All 167 patients were studied by chest X-ray (CXR), and 20 patients with positive CXR and worsening clinical condition also underwent computed tomography (CT). The following findings were evaluated on both modalities: interstitial reticulation (IR), nodules (N), ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations (CONS), bacterial superinfection and pulmonary complications. RESULTS: Ninety of 167 patients had positive CXR results. Abnormalities identified on CXR, variously combined and distributed, were as follows: 53 IR, 5 N, 13 GGO, 50 CONS; the predominant combination was represented by six GGO with CONS. Of the 20 CXR-positive cases also studied by CT, 17 showed pathological findings. The abnormalities identified on CT, variously combined and distributed, were as follows: 14 IR, 2 N, 5 GGO; the predominant combination was 10 GGO with CONS. Despite the differences between the two modalities, the principle radiological findings of bacterial superinfection were tree-in-bud pattern, consolidation with air bronchogram, and pleural and pericardial effusion. Fifteen of the 20 patients studied by both CXR and chest CT showed respiratory complications with bilateral and diffuse CONS on CXR and CT. Six of 15 died: 4/6 of acute respiratory distress syndrome and 2/6 of multiple organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the radiological and clinical characteristics of a large population of patients affected by H1N1 influenza. CXR and chest CT identified the site and extent of the pulmonary lesions and documented signs of bacterial superinfection and pulmonary complications.","publish_time":"2011-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coppola, M.; Porto, A.; De Santo, D.; De Fronzo, S.; Grassi, R.; Rotondo, A.","journal":"Radiol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/135434ccc207696d52d47ec6bd853361080db2ce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CXR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["female patients","group of patients","GGO","positive CXR results","clinical findings","CXR-positive cases","large population of patients","chest CT","principle radiological findings of bacterial superinfection","pulmonary complications","suspected H1N1 influenza","following findings","pathological findings","clinical characteristics","clinical condition","respiratory complications","laboratory findings indicative of viral influenza","documented signs of bacterial superinfection","pulmonary lesions","years","diffuse CONS","modalities","chest X-ray","study population","predominant combination","Abnormalities","age range","mean age","acute respiratory distress syndrome","months","air bronchogram","extent","tree","consolidations","site","bud pattern","nodules","ground-glass opacities","multiple organ failure","interstitial reticulation","computed tomography","paper","throat","pericardial effusion","hospital","METHODS","PURPOSE","CONCLUSIONS","differences","MATERIALS"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we review the pertinent patient characteristics, therapy, and outcome data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1993 to April 2013, 249 children and adolescents (193 protocol patients) diagnosed with AML were enrolled in the three BFM studies. Patients were mainly treated in one of five pediatric hematology/oncology centers distributed over Austria. RESULTS: Many characteristics and outcome parameters were not statistically different between the three trials. Almost similar proportions of patients were stratified into two risk groups: standard risk (SR) (approximately 37 % overall) and high-risk (HR) (61 %). MLL rearrangements were found in 23 % of patients overall as the most frequent genetic aberration subtype. Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 84\u201395 % of patients. The most important type of event was leukemic relapse (5-year cumulative incidence 40 \u00B1 8 %, 21 \u00B1 5 %, and 39 \u00B1 6 %; p = 0.058), with a trend to a higher rate specifically in SR patients of study AML-BFM 2004 compared with AML-BFM 98. Importantly, the frequency of death from causes other than relapse sequelae declined over the years (AML-BFM 93: 5/42 12 %, AML-BFM 98: 5/57 9 %, and AML-BFM 2004: 5/94 5 %). Altogether, event-free survival at 5 years varied insignificantly (48 \u00B1 8 %, 61 \u00B1 7 %, and 50 \u00B1 6 %; p = 0.406). Nevertheless, survival (pSU) apparently improved from BFM 93 to subsequent studies, both overall (57 \u00B1 8 %, 75 \u00B1 6 %, and 62 \u00B1 6 %; p = 0.046) and regarding the HR group (5-year-probability of survival (pSU) 40 \u00B1 10 %, 66 \u00B1 8 %, and 52 \u00B1 8 %; p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: Treatment of pediatric AML in Austria renders survival rates in the range of international best practice. However, unambiguous statistical comparison of treatment periods is eventually hampered by small numbers and inequalities of recruitment. Hence, only internationally collaborative trials will allow developing treatment further to achieve higher cure rates with fewer events.","publish_time":"2014-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boztug, Heidrun; M\u00FChlegger, Nora; Glogova, Evgenia; Mann, Georg; Urban, Christian; Meister, Bernhard; Schmitt, Klaus; Jones, Neil; Attarbaschi, Andishe; Haas, Oskar; Strehl, Sabine; Lion, Thomas; P\u00F6tschger, Ulrike; Fink, Franz-Martin; Gadner, Helmut; Dworzak, Michael","journal":"Memo","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f20db6641171fe3363087e166dd1241dd30407d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102234.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102234/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BFM","AML","MLL"],"locations":["Austria"],"keyphrases":["SR patients of study AML-BFM","BFM studies","AML-Berlin","Treatment of pediatric AML","international BFM study center","protocol patients","Austria","survival rates","similar proportions of patients","event-free survival","developing treatment","pediatric hematology","years","collaborative trials","pSU","higher cure rates","leukemic relapse","higher rate","relapse sequelae","risk groups","year-probability","standard risk","outcome parameters","outcome data","subsequent studies","HR group","consecutive pediatric acute myeloid leukemia","unambiguous statistical comparison of treatment periods","year cumulative incidence","pertinent patient characteristics","important type of event","range of international best practice","close cooperation","therapy","Frankfurt-M\u00FCnster","small numbers","fewer events","oncology centers","frequent genetic aberration subtype","inequalities of recruitment","RESULTS","children","adolescents","CONCLUSION","Complete remission","BACKGROUND","frequency of death","trend","MLL rearrangements","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This article reviews reports of perinatal and breast milk transmission of ZIKV and summarizes current clinical outcome data of pediatric non-congenital ZIKV infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Perinatal transmission and presence of infective ZIKV particles in breast milk have been reported. Most symptomatic non-congenital ZIKV infection in infants and children is mild and self-limited, but long-term follow-up studies are lacking. SUMMARY: The mechanism and impact of perinatal and breast milk transmission is unclear. The current WHO infant feeding guidelines in areas of ZIKV transmission support breastfeeding. Unless any scientific data raise concern regarding transmission via breastfeeding, the current guidelines should continue to be followed. Prospective population-based cohort studies to investigate maternal, perinatal, infant, and child outcomes are needed.","publish_time":"2017-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hagmann, Stefan H.

When the treatment is started early, the survival rate reaches around 55% of cases. HLH usually presents with persistent fever, pancytopenia, and organomegaly and is associated with very high levels of serum ferritin.

Although esophageal varices can be treated with endoscopic procedures, the treatment for gastric varices is still controversial. The aim of this study was to describe a surgical technique and our preliminary results of hand-assisted laparoscopic Hassab\u2019s procedure. METHODS: Between February 2002 and May 2005, we performed 7 cases of gastric varices with this type of operation. The patients included 4 men and 3 women who ranged in age from 23 to 74 years (underlying liver disease: 5 case of liver cirrhosis, 1 case of polycystic disease, 1 case of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction). After splenctomy was performed, we devascularized the vessels of the upper stomach and the esophagus 5 cm away from the esophago-cardia junction. RESULTS: The operative time ranged from 132 to 290 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss was estimated to be from 50 ml to 475 ml. The weight of removed spleen ranged from 110 g to 800 g. During the follow-up period, all gastric varices disappeared and no bleeding from varicose veins was observed. All patients had hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia before surgery (mean: 11.1 \u00B1 7.4 \u00D7 10(4)/ml), which was improved postoperatively (mean: 30.8 \u00B119.0 \u00D7 10(4)/ml). This data were statistically significant (P = 0.033). One patient died of aspiration pneumonia related to postoperative pyloric stricture. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is no agreement concerning the best treatment of gastric varices, the hand-assisted laparoscopic Hassab\u2019s operation is a safe, moderately invasive method, and its outcome appears to be equal to that of other open procedures.","publish_time":"2006-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamamoto, Joji; Nagai, Motoki; Smith, Barry; Tamaki, Satoshi; Kubota, Tadao; Sasaki, Ken; Ohmori, Toshihiro; Maeda, Kiyotaka","journal":"World J Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79b57f30d41a5a0f1fe82c0d02efaf3140721120.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102344.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102344/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of gastric varices","esophagogastric varices","esophageal varices","best treatment of gastric varices","patients","case of polycystic disease","case of liver cirrhosis","laparoscopic Hassab\u2019s operation","Bleeding","mean","underlying liver disease","preliminary results of hand","laparoscopic Hassab\u2019s procedure","case of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction","portal hypertension","type of operation","endoscopic procedures","open procedures","major cause of death","aspiration pneumonia","surgical technique","postoperative pyloric stricture","years","hypersplenism","thrombocytopenia","surgery","agreement","invasive method","follow-up period","upper stomach","esophagus","outcome","study","women","BACKGROUND","weight of removed spleen","operative time","varicose veins","esophago-cardia junction","Intraoperative blood loss","data","vessels","aim","minutes","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","splenctomy"],"language":"en"},

For this double-blind controlled trial, 62 Holstein male calves were purchased at birth and transported to a research facility. At the naturally occurring onset of diarrhea, defined as the first occurrence of a fecal score greater than 2 on a 4-point scale, calves were enrolled in the study. Each calf with diarrhea was randomly assigned to receive a single subcutaneous injection of MEL at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg of BW or an equal volume of placebo (PLA) solution. Milk, starter ration, and water intakes were determined daily for each calf from arrival until 56 d of age. The calves were weighed on arrival and each week thereafter. Time to weaning and weaning weight were recorded for each calf. Crude associations between treatment and each outcome variable were examined using t-tests and Pearson chi-squared tests. Subsequently, multivariable regression models were constructed to examine the impact of MEL therapy on meaningful outcome variables. The primary experimental unit in all analyses was the individual calf. In total, 56 calves presented with clinical signs of diarrhea and were enrolled in the study. Two PLA-treated calves died after being enrolled in the study, and there was no calf mortality among the MEL-treated calves. For calves that developed diarrhea after 10 d of age, MEL-treated calves were more likely to consume their entire daily milk allowance (P \u003C 0.05) as compared with PLA-treated calves. Meloxicam-treated calves began consuming starter ration earlier (P \u003C 0.01) and at a greater rate (P \u003C 0.001), and consumed more water (P \u003C 0.001) compared with PLA-treated animals. Over the study period, calves treated with MEL gained BW at a faster rate (P \u003C 0.01) than calves treated with PLA. There was no difference in weaning weight (P \u003E 0.05), but MEL-treated calves tended to wean earlier (P = 0.11) than PLA-treated calves. These results demonstrate that calves receiving a single injection of MEL at the onset of diarrhea had improved appetite and performance compared with PLA-treated calves. Thus, MEL is an effective supportive therapy for neonatal calf diarrhea complex.","publish_time":"2010-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Todd, C. G.; Millman, S. T.; McKnight, D. R.; Duffield, T.

The present study aimed to clarify the effect of viral and bacterial co\u2010detections on disease severity during paediatric ARI. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from children under 2 years of age presenting with ARI to the emergency department were screened by quantitative PCR for 17 respiratory viruses and the bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Associations between pathogen detection and clinical measures of disease severity were investigated. RESULTS: RSV was the most common virus detected, present in 29 of 58 samples from children with ARI (50%). Detection of S. pneumoniae was significantly more frequent during RSV infections compared to other respiratory viruses (adjusted effect size: 1.8, P: 0.03), and co\u2010detection of both pathogens was associated with higher clinical disease severity scores (adjusted effect size: 1.2, P: 0.03).

To determine whether lycorine has an anti-tumor effect in vivo, a series of experiments were carried out in this study. HL-60 cells (5\u00D7106) were inoculated i.v. into severe combined immuno-deficiency (SCID) mice after these mice had been irradiated (total body receiving 200cGy \u03C7 irradiation). Treatment was given once a day from day 2 to 6, and from day 14 to 18. Lycorine (5 or 10mg/kg/day i.p.) was found to decrease the percentages of immature granular leukocytes and of monocytes among the peripheral blood cells, and the mean survival time of both lycorine-treated groups was longer than that of the control group. Compared with the asynchronous and cytosine arabinoside- (Ara-C) treated (20mg/kg/day i.p.) group, treatment with lycorine was more effective. Lycorine was also found to alleviate the infiltration of tumor cells into the liver, bone, and marrow. When SCID mice inoculated with HL-60 cells were then treated with lycorine, no severe adverse effects were observed. This study revealed that lycorine, when tested in the human leukemia xenograft models, appears to exhibit anti-tumor activity in vivo and is a useful therapy against acute promyelocytic leukemia.","publish_time":"2007-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, J.; Li, Y.; Tang, L.

This is true in a number of circumstances: curtailing access to information regarding the health and welfare of soldiers in the Kuwait and Iraq wars, poor health conditions in Aboriginal communities, downplaying epidemics to bolster economies, and so forth.

Whole genome sequencing and analysis revealed that the SH strain belonged to subtype G2b and has a unique 12-aa deletion (aa 399\u2013410) including the antigenic epitope NEP-1C9 (aa 398\u2013406) of the N protein. PEDV SH strain is highly pathogenic to challenged newborn piglets, resulting in 100 % morbidity and mortality. Pathological examination revealed significant villus atrophy in the jejuna of infected piglets. Mice inoculated with inactivated PEDV SH produced antibodies against the N protein, but no antibodies against the deletions. These results illustrated that deletion of the NEP-1C9 epitope had no effect on the immunogenicity or pathogenicity of PEDV, providing evidence of the necessity to monitor the genetic diversity of the virus.

We compared the KCDC data to the RV PCR data of adult patients who visited a tertiary care center.

From the KCDC website, we collected the RV PCR test results of 22 540 patients. Three graphs of weekly positivity rates were made for adults, children, and the KCDC data per each RV, and these graphs were then compared with one another. Whereas RV outbreaks were coincident between the KCDC and the adult graph with respect to influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus, the same was not true for human bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. However, a negative predictive value of the KCDC data in the prediction of the occurrence of an outbreak in the adult graph was high for the respective eight RVs (85\u2010100%).

The critical feature of this model is that the community is modelled as a small-world network of interconnected nodes. Each node is linked to a fixed number of immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically remote nodes. Transmission can only propagate between linked nodes. This model exhibits two features typical of SARS transmission: geographically localized outbreaks and \u201Csuper-spreaders\u201D. Neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible-infected-removed models of disease transmission. Our analysis indicates that \u201Csuper-spreaders\u201D may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant. Moreover, we find that nosocomial transmission in Hong Kong directly contributed to the severity of the outbreak and that by limiting individual exposure time to 3\u20135 days the extent of the SARS epidemic would have been minimal.","publish_time":"2005-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Small, Michael; Tse, C.

Su objetivo es facilitar y estandarizar la toma de decisiones en los aspectos m\u00E1s relevantes desde la organizaci\u00F3n administrativa de las \u00E1reas de atenci\u00F3n hasta el abordaje cl\u00EDnico del paciente, teniendo en cuenta la seguridad del personal sanitario, la infraestructura y recursos con los que cuenta el pa\u00EDs para responder a la emergencia. Este documento est\u00E1 sujeto a la evoluci\u00F3n del conocimiento y a los resultados de investigaciones en curso. Abstract The behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 infection has forced World Health Organisation to call for the global activation of emergency and contingency mechanisms to respond to the world-wide public health crisis. Intensive Care Units are one of the main health care resources in this situation due to the number of expected cases of severe pneumonia from infected patients. Different guidelines and different levels of evidence from the available information have motivated Asociaci\u00F3n Colombiana de Medicina cr\u00EDtica y Cuidados Intensivos (AMCI) to assemble a multidisciplinary team of experts in critical care medicine to prepare a consensus statement of good clinical practice for the care of patients with COVID-19. Its aim is to simplify and standardise decision-making in the most relevant aspects: from the administrative organisation of the care facilities, to the clinical approach of patients, taking into account the safety of health care professionals, and the infrastructure and resources available in Colombia to respond to the emergency. This document will be adapted to any new knowledge and results of on-going research.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luis Accini Mendoza, Jos\u00E9; Beltr\u00E1n, Nelly; Estrada, Victor Hugo Nieto; Bola\u00F1os, Elizabeth Ramos; G\u00F3mez, Camilo Pizarro; Rebolledo M, Carlos Eduardo; P\u00E9rez, Julio Cesar Duran; Castell, Carmelo due\u00F1as; Arias, Arturo; Barciela, Eduardo; Camargo, Rub\u00E9n; Antonio Rojas, Jos\u00E9; Polo, Yulieth Zabaleta; P\u00E9rez, Mar\u00EDa Cristina Florian; Torres, Vanesa","journal":"Acta Colombiana de Cuidado Intensivo","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d437b6fbf7a2b9f17dad6678504b5388645351fd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0122726220300331?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0122726220300331","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Organizaci\u00F3n Mundial de la Salud"],"locations":["Colombia"],"keyphrases":["the world","the emergency","from the administrative organisation of the care","Abstract The behaviour of the SARS","and the infrastructure and","the clinical approach of patients","one of the main health care","the number of expected cases of severe pneumonia from infected patients","taking into account the safety of health care professionals","consensus statement of good clinical practice for the care of patients with COVID","call for the global activation of emergency and contingency mechanisms","and different levels of evidence from the available information have motivated Asociaci\u00F3n Colombiana","making in the most relevant aspects","assemble a multidisciplinary team of experts in critical care","any new knowledge and results of on","Medicina cr\u00EDtica","Intensive Care Units","available in Colombia","Unidades de Cuidados Intensivos","simplify and standardise decision","forced World Health Organisation","respond","wide public health crisis","AMCI","atenci\u00F3n de pacientes","emergencia","cuenta","convocatoria global","\u00E1reas de atenci\u00F3n","organizaci\u00F3n administrativa","principales recursos","crisis de salud p\u00FAblica latente","pacientes infectados","Organizaci\u00F3n Mundial","This document will be adapted","situation due","infection","buena pr\u00E1ctica cl\u00EDnica","sistemas sanitarios","informaci\u00F3n disponible","going research","tasa de neumon\u00EDas complicadas","aspectos","seguridad","consenso","personal sanitario","equipo multidisciplinario","abordaje cl\u00EDnico","Its aim","activaci\u00F3n de mecanismos","evoluci\u00F3n","conocimiento","niveles de evidencia","infraestructura","expertos","resultados de investigaciones","lineamientos","toma de decisiones","infecci\u00F3n","documento","comportamiento","pa\u00EDs","respuesta","objetivo"],"language":"es"},

The objectives of this study were to determine the feasibility of implementing nurse-initiated PCR testing of respiratory specimens in nursing home settings and to compare antibiotic prescribing prior to and during the implementation. METHODS: This was a pragmatic, historically controlled study in 3 nursing homes (181 total beds) in Melbourne, Australia. RESULTS: The number of PCR tests of respiratory specimens (over 12 months) increased from 5 to 67 when nurses could initiate the tests. Residents with RTI symptoms had a virus identified by PCR in 50.7% of tests, including 14 positive for influenza. Six outbreaks were identified. When clustering was taken into consideration, incidence rates of antibiotic days of therapy did not change (incidence rate ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval, 0.25-3.35, P = .92) despite identification of more viral pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: In nursing homes, nurse-initiated PCR testing of respiratory specimens is feasible and useful in terms of identifying the cause of many RTIs and outbreaks, and viruses are common in this context. However, the current study suggests the availability of these test results alone does not impact antibiotic prescribing.","publish_time":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dowson, Leslie; Marshall, Caroline; Buising, Kirsty; Friedman, N.

Our study describes the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HMPV present in patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Guangzhou, Southern China. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Two tertiary hospitals in Guangzhou. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Throat swabs were collected over a 3-year period from 5133 paediatric patients (\u226414 years) hospitalised with ARI. Patients who are HMPV positive with clinical presentations (101/103) were recorded for further analysis. RESULTS: Of the 5133 patients included in the study, 103 (2.0%) were positive for HMPV. HMPV was more prevalent in children \u22645 years (2.2%, 98/4399) compared with older children (\u003E5\u201314 years) (0.7%, 5/734) (P=0.004). Two seasonal HMPV peaks were observed each year and mainly occurred in spring and early summer. Overall, 18.4% (19/103) of patients who are HMPV positive were codetected with other pathogens, most frequently respiratory syncytial virus (36.8%, 7/19). Patients who are HMPV positive presented with a wide spectrum of clinical features, including cough (100.0%, 101/101), abnormal pulmonary breath sound (91.1%, 92/101), fever (88.1%, 89/101), expectoration (77.2%, 78/101), coryza (50.5%, 51/101) and wheezing (46.5%, 47/101). The main diagnosis of patients who are HMPV positive was bronchopneumonia (66.7%, 56/84). Fever (\u226538\u02DAC) (91.6%, 76/83) was detected more often in patients with only HMPV detected than in patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected (72.2%, 13/18) (P=0.037), whereas diarrhoea was more common in patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected (22.2%, 4/18), compared with patients with HMPV only (3.6%, 3/83) (P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: HMPV is an important respiratory pathogen in children with ARI in Guangzhou, particularly in children \u22645 years old. HMPV has a seasonal variation. Bronchopneumonia is a major diagnosis in patients who are HMPV positive.","publish_time":"2018-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ling; Liu, Wenkuan; Liu, Donglan; Chen, Dehui; Tan, Weiping; Qiu, Shuyan; Xu, Duo; Li, Xiao; Liu, Tiantian; Zhou, Rong","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a741e03f654d2e7de5c7e94ff6e55be6a6bc0607.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0fc3d0494950e34a94402125e4f7adce968bc062.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2c91d1596f703f2849124a1cb1a9c14c7084c9b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5829904.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29437754/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV","ARI"],"locations":["Southern China","Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["HMPV positive","paediatric patients","seasonal HMPV peaks","clinical characteristics of HMPV present","main diagnosis of patients","important respiratory pathogen","Guangzhou","older children","STUDY DESIGN","cross-sectional study","years old","important respiratory viral pathogens","acute respiratory illness","respiratory syncytial virus","clinical presentations","bronchopneumonia","fever","wide spectrum of clinical features","major diagnosis","year period","seasonal variation","infants","PARTICIPANTS","METHODS","Throat swabs","abnormal pulmonary breath sound","spring","SETTING","tertiary hospitals","cough","OBJECTIVES","Human metapneumovirus","Southern China","diarrhoea","CONCLUSIONS","early summer","RESULTS","analysis","expectoration","coryza","wheezing"],"language":"en"},

Although both recombinant protein variants exhibited comparable activities in antiproliferation of PK-15 cells and in nitric oxide (NO) induction of porcine peripheral monocytes, antiviral activity of rPoIFN-\u03B3-W protein was significantly higher (P \u003C0.001) than that of rPoIFN-\u03B3-M protein in a plaque inhibition assay using pseudorabies virus (PRV). IC50 values of rPoIFN-\u03B3-W and rPoIFN-\u03B3-M protein in anti-PRV assay were determined as 5.3\u00B11.3 and 9.3\u00B14.3nM, respectively. In conclusion, we have identified five novel SNPs in PoIFN-\u03B3 cDNA, including two missense polymorphisms that result in Q67R and K61R replacements. Our results further demonstrate that Q67R can markedly reduce antiviral activity of the PoIFN-\u03B3 protein. This is the first report that shows the functional SNP in the coding region of IFN-\u03B3. In the future, it is imperative to determine whether Q67R replacement in IFN-\u03B3 may have disease association.","publish_time":"2007-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Yi-Hsin; Chow, Kuan-Chih; Huang, San-Yuan; Chi, Lang-Ming; Huang, Chienjin; Chiou, Shiow-Her","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/def2c6aa475f309fa8a2c450c71410fd316c5cdf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112673.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589007000995; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589007000995","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rPoIFN-\u03B3","PoIFN-\u03B3 protein","\u03B3-W protein","interferon-\u03B3","recombinant PoIFN-\u03B3","porcine IFN-\u03B3","PoIFN-\u03B3 cDNAs of Duroc breed","recombinant protein variants","mature protein","Duroc hybrid","Landrance breeds","antiviral activity of rPoIFN","IC50 values of rPoIFN","porcine breeds","Q67R replacement","coding region of IFN","cDNA sequence","coding sequence","A251G polymorphisms","missense polymorphisms","K61R replacements","recombinant proteins","single nucleotide polymorphisms","anti-PRV assay","induction of porcine peripheral monocytes","novel SNPs","plaque inhibition assay","flight mass spectrometry","ionization time","comparable activities","antiproliferation of PK","prokaryotic expression vector pET32","pseudorabies virus","matrix","MALDI-TOF MS","functional SNP","cells","laser desorption","nitric oxide","Escherichia coli","R67","A269G","disease association","encoded Q67","report","bioactivities","identity","future","conclusion","positions","results","nM"],"language":"en"},

In recent years, antigen mimicry has been defined at the molecular level for some xeno-antigens. However, until now there has been no demonstration of structural mimicry between a human anti-idiotypic antibody and a self structure. To address this question, we used human IgE as the self structure and a well-defined anti-human IgE mAb (BSW17). We describe the isolation of two anti- idiotypic antibodies specific for the anti-IgE antibody BSW17 from a non-immune human Fab phage display library. Interestingly, these two anti-idiotypic antibodies mimic the same molecular surface region as a previously described IgE peptide mimotope isolated by panning on BSW17, but they cover a much larger epitope on the IgE molecule. Accordingly, immunisation of rabbits with the two anti-idiotypic antibodies induced high-affinity antibodies with the same characteristics as BSW17. Thus, our data demonstrate that it is possible to isolate anti-idiotypic antibodies derived from the human genome without the need for hyperimmunisation, and confirm Jerne\u2019s hypothesis that both foreign antigens and self structures can be mimicked by our own immunoglobulins.","publish_time":"2000-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vogel, Monique; Miescher, Sylvia; Kuhn, Sonja; Z\u00FCrcher, Adrian W.; Stadler, Michael B.; Ruf, Christine; Effenberger, Friedrich; Kricek, Franz; Stadler, Beda M.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b83c109787fc758361cbea286748f5f8016ede03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125776.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283600937136; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283600937136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IgE"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-idiotypic antibodies","human anti-idiotypic antibody","anti- idiotypic antibodies specific","anti-IgE antibody BSW17","well-defined anti-human IgE mAb","human genome","IgE molecule","self antigen","self structures","high-affinity antibodies","described IgE peptide mimotope","Jerne\u2019s hypothesis","foreign antigens","antigen mimicry","Jerne\u2019s network hypothesis","non-immune human Fab phage display library","molecular level","epitope present","xeno-antigens","larger epitope","molecular surface region","demonstration of structural mimicry","binding site","internal image","hyperimmunisation","need","isolation","recent years","characteristics","immunisation of rabbits","question","data","immunoglobulins"],"language":"en"},

Frequently individuals with influenza develop headaches, meningismus, and even seizures in addition to their typical respiratory symptoms. In the past decades, influenza viruses have also been associated with serious non-respiratory signs. The famous 1918 strain of influenza was associated with von Economo\u0027s encephalitis lethargica and postencephalitic parkinsonism. In the 1960s influenza virus infections in children were associated with Reye\u0027s syndrome characterized often by fatty non-inflammatory hepatic disease and an encephalopathy with marked non-inflammatory cerebral edema. Intermittently children with influenza develop focal myalgia and myositis. Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome was epidemiologically associated with the 1978 killed influenza vaccine but not subsequent vaccines. Although occasional children with influenza have developed encephalopathy, from 2000 through 2004 there was an increase in the number of serious cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy accompanying infection with the influenza A 2009 strain. The current H5N1 strain of bird influenza occasionally infects humans with a high mortality rate and some appear to have central nervous signs. This chapter explores what is known about these influenza neurologic associations.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davis, Larry E.; Koster, Fredrick; Cawthon, Andrew","journal":"Handbook of Clinical Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/258d578bfde708d46209cd865d5fc6114e3fede6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152431.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444534880000304; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444534880000304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015508/; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-444-53488-0.00030-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","strain of influenza","influenza vaccine","influenza neurologic associations","respiratory viruses","s influenza virus infections","current H5N1 strain of bird influenza","serious non-respiratory signs","respiratory system","typical respiratory symptoms","upper respiratory tract","humans","B viruses","occasional children","fatty non-inflammatory hepatic disease","central nervous signs","marked non-inflammatory cerebral edema","number of serious cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy","Reye\u0027s syndrome","Barr\u00E9 syndrome","patients","seizures","meningismus","addition","Economo\u0027s encephalitis lethargica","postencephalitic parkinsonism","headaches","focal myalgia","high mortality rate","increase","subsequent vaccines","myositis","individuals","past decades","Guillain","chapter"],"language":"en"},

All mRNAs of HBoV1 are transcribed from a single promoter. METHODS: In this study, we constructed EGFP and luciferase reporter gene vectors under the control of the HBoV1 full promoter (nt 1\u2013252) and its mutated variants, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy was used to observe expression activities of the EGFP. Dual-luciferase reporter vectors were employed in order to evaluate critical promoter elements and the effect of NS1 protein on promoter activity. RESULTS: The HBoV1 promoter activity was about 2.2-fold and 1.9-fold higher than that of the CMV promoter in 293 T and HeLa cells, respectively. The putative transcription factor binding region of the promoter was identified to be located between nt 96 and nt 145. Mutations introduced in the CAAT box of the HBoV1 promoter reduced promoter activity by 34%, whereas nucleotide substitutions in the TATA box had no effect on promoter activity. The HBoV1 promoter activities in 293 T and HeLa cells, in the presence of NS1 protein, were 2- to 2.5-fold higher than those in the absence of NS1 protein. CONCLUSION: The HBoV1 promoter was highly active in 293 T and HeLa cell lines, and the sequence from nt 96 to nt 145 was critical for the activity of HBoV1 promoter. The CAAT box, in contrast to the TATA-box, was important for optimum promoter activity. In addition, the transcriptional activity of this promoter could be trans-activated by the viral nonstructural protein NS1 in these cells.","publish_time":"2013-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jingjing; Yang, Yongbo; Dong, Yanming; Li, Yongshu; Huang, Yu; Yi, Qianhui; Liu, Kaiyu; Li, Yi","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcab94a486401ed99583e6d5b44284ede564152d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3874741.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24161033/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-315","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFP","CMV","TATA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV1 promoter activity","activity of HBoV1 promoter","CMV promoter","single promoter","HBoV1 promoter activities","optimum promoter activity","critical promoter elements","transcriptional activity","mRNAs of HBoV1","effect of NS1 protein","TATA box","TATA-box","HeLa cells","CAAT box","presence of NS1 protein","absence of NS1 protein","fold","viral nonstructural protein NS1","EGFP","luciferase reporter gene vectors","Dual-luciferase reporter vectors","HeLa cell lines","gastrointestinal disease","expression activities","etiologic agent of respiratory disease","order","control","sequence","humans","region","contrast","putative transcription factor","Human bocavirus","nucleotide substitutions","BACKGROUND","study","RESULTS","Fluorescence microscopy","parvovirus","addition","Mutations","CONCLUSION","mutated variants","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The innate immune system comprises both a cellular and a humoral arm. Components of the humoral arm include soluble pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiate the immune response in coordination with the cellular arm, therefore acting as functional ancestors of antibodies. The long pentraxin PTX3 is a prototypic soluble PRM that is produced at sites of infection and inflammation by both somatic and immune cells. Gene targeting of this evolutionarily conserved protein has revealed a non-redundant role in resistance to selected pathogens. Moreover, PTX3 exerts important functions at the crossroad between innate immunity, inflammation, and female fertility. The human PTX3 protein contains a single N-glycosylation site that is fully occupied by complex type oligosaccharides, mainly fucosylated and sialylated biantennary glycans. Glycosylation has been implicated in a number of PTX3 activities, including neutralization of influenza viruses, modulation of the complement system, and attenuation of leukocyte recruitment. Therefore, this post translational modification might act as a fine tuner of PTX3 functions in native immunity and inflammation. Here we review the studies on PTX3, with emphasis on the glycan-dependent mechanisms underlying pathogen recognition and crosstalk with other components of the innate immune system.","publish_time":"2013-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Inforzato, Antonio; Reading, Patrick C.; Barbati, Elisa; Bottazzi, Barbara; Garlanda, Cecilia; Mantovani, Alberto","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16eb672447620efa83aa59f913d690a95240f488.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3539679.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2012.00407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23316195/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["innate immune system","Innate immunity","inflammation","human PTX3 protein","immune cells","number of PTX3 activities","long pentraxin PTX3","adaptive immune response","fine tuner of PTX3 functions","cellular arm","humoral arm","pathogen recognition","native immunity","complement system","Components","pathogens","soluble pattern recognition molecules","important functions","conserved protein","prototypic soluble PRM","single N-glycosylation site","neutralization of influenza viruses","glycan-dependent mechanisms","activation","orientation","crosstalk","crossroad","non-redundant role","key roles","modulation","emphasis","PRMs","line of defense","resistance","molecular patterns","coordination","attenuation of leukocyte recruitment","sites of infection","complex type oligosaccharides","female fertility","sialylated biantennary glycans","post translational modification","functional ancestors of antibodies","Gene","studies"],"language":"en"},

The viruses are genetically close to the classical U.S. H1N1 and triple-reassortant H1N2 and H3N2 viruses, respectively. Comparative pathogenesis caused by Korean H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 SIV was evaluated in this study. FINDINGS: The H3N2 infected pigs had severe scores of gross and histopathological lesions at post-inoculation days (PID) 2, and this then progressively decreased. Both the H1N1 and H1N2 infected pigs lacked gross lesions at PID 2, but they showed moderate to severe pneumonia on PID 4, 7 and 14. The pigs infected with H1N1 had significant scores of gross and histopathological lesions when compared with the other pigs infected with H1N2, H3N2, and mock at PID 14. Mean SIV antigen-positive scores were rarely detected for pigs infected with H1N2 and H3N2 from PID 7, whereas a significantly increased amount of viral antigens were found in the bronchioles and alveolar epithelium of the H1N1infected pigs at PID 14. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that Korean SIV subtypes had different pulmonary pathologic patterns. The Korean H3N2 rapidly induced acute lung lesions such as broncho-interstitial pneumonia, while the Korean H1N1 showed longer course of infection as compared to other strains.","publish_time":"2014-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lyoo, Kwang-Soo; Kim, Jeong-Ki; Jung, Kwonil; Kang, Bo-Kyu; Song, Daesub","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a6456acf2a0eda491acf31d4887daf43a25ca27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4190492.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-11-170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25253051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV","PID"],"locations":["Korea","U.S."],"keyphrases":["H3N2 infected pigs","PID","H1N2 infected pigs","Korean H3N2","H3N2 SIV","Korean H1N1","H3N2 viruses","gross lesions","H1N1infected pigs","Korean SIV subtypes","histopathological lesions","severe scores of gross","triple-reassortant H1N2","significant scores of gross","Mean SIV antigen-positive scores","severe pneumonia","induced acute lung lesions","predominant subtypes of swine influenza","Korea swine population","broncho-interstitial pneumonia","different pulmonary pathologic patterns","post-inoculation days","bronchioles","alveolar epithelium","longer course of infection","Comparative pathogenesis","viral antigens","BACKGROUND","FINDINGS","mock","CONCLUSIONS","study","strains"],"language":"en"},

IFN sensing by the cell activates transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) able to induce an antiviral state by affecting viral replication and release. IFN also induces the expression of ISGs that function as negative regulators to limit the strength and duration of IFN response. The ISGs identified so far belong to coding genes. However, only a small proportion of the transcriptome corresponds to coding transcripts and it has been estimated that there could be as many coding as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). To address whether IFN can also regulate the expression of lncRNAs, we analyzed the transcriptome of HuH7 cells treated or not with IFN\u03B12 by expression arrays. Analysis of the arrays showed increased levels of several well-characterized coding genes that respond to IFN both at early or late times. Furthermore, we identified several IFN-stimulated or -downregulated lncRNAs (ISRs and IDRs). Further validation showed that ISR2, 8, and 12 expression mimics that of their neighboring genes GBP1, IRF1, and IL6, respectively, all related to the IFN response. These genes are induced in response to different doses of IFN\u03B12 in different cell lines at early (ISR2 or 8) or later (ISR12) time points. IFN\u03B2 also induced the expression of these lncRNAs. ISR2 and 8 were also induced by an influenza virus unable to block the IFN response but not by other wild-type lytic viruses tested. Surprisingly, both ISR2 and 8 were significantly upregulated in cultured cells and livers from patients infected with HCV. Increased levels of ISR2 were also detected in patients chronically infected with HIV. This is relevant as genome-wide guilt-by-association studies predict that ISR2, 8, and 12 may function in viral processes, in the IFN pathway and the antiviral response. Therefore, we propose that these lncRNAs could be induced by IFN to function as positive or negative regulators of the antiviral response.","publish_time":"2014-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carnero, Elena; Barriocanal, Marina; Segura, Victor; Guruceaga, Elizabeth; Prior, Celia; B\u00F6rner, Kathleen; Grimm, Dirk; Fortes, Puri","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64adce98190f9491944dc9d5141e0cccb6360519.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4222131.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25414701/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00548","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["duration of IFN response","transcription of IFN","IFN pathway","IFN sensing","antiviral response","expression of lncRNAs","expression of ISGs","stimulated genes","expression arrays","Increased levels of ISR2","well-characterized coding genes","coding transcripts","expression mimics","downregulated lncRNAs","function","antiviral state","neighboring genes GBP1","non-coding RNAs","negative regulators","patients","different doses of IFN\u03B12","different cell lines","transcriptome of HuH7 cells","viral replication","viral processes","cultured cells","key players","strength","genome-wide guilt","livers","IL6","IRF1","association studies","influenza virus unable","wild-type lytic viruses","Interferons","IFNs","release","ISRs","IDRs","Analysis","late times","small proportion","ISR12","time points","HCV","HIV","IFN\u03B2","validation"],"language":"en"},

In resting cells, TK2 is suggested to play a key role in the mitochondrial salvage pathway to provide pyrimidine nucleotides for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis and maintenance. However, recently the physiological role of TK2turned out to have direct clinical relevance as well. Point mutations in the gene encoding TK2 have been correlated to mtDNA disorders in a heterogeneous group of patients suffering from the so\u2010called mtDNA depletion syndrome (MDS). TK2 activity could also be involved in mitochondrial toxicity associated to prolonged treatment with antiviral nucleoside analogues like AZT and FIAU. Therefore, TK2 inhibitors can be considered as valuable tools to unravel the role of TK2 in the maintenance and homeostasis of mitochondrial nucleotide pools and mtDNA, and to clarify the contribution of TK2 activity to mitochondrial toxicity of certain antivirals. Highly selective TK\u20102 inhibitors having an acyclic nucleoside structure and efficiently discriminating between TK\u20102 and the closely related TK\u20101 have already been reported.

Owing to the nosocomial nature of the outbreak, it is particularly important to gain a better understanding of the epidemiological determinants characterizing the risk of MERS death in order to predict the heterogeneous risk of death in medical settings. METHODS: We have devised a novel statistical model that identifies the risk of MERS death during the outbreak in real time. While accounting for the time delay from illness onset to death, risk factors for death were identified using a linear predictor tied to a logit model. We employ this approach to (1) quantify the risks of death and (2) characterize the temporal evolution of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as case ascertainment greatly improved during the course of the outbreak. RESULTS: Senior persons aged 60 years or over were found to be 9.3 times (95 % confidence interval (CI), 5.3\u201316.9) more likely to die compared to younger MERS cases. Patients under treatment were at a 7.8-fold (95 % CI, 4.0\u201316.7) significantly higher risk of death compared to other MERS cases. The CFR among patients aged 60 years or older under treatment was estimated at 48.2 % (95 % CI, 35.2\u201361.3) as of July 31, 2015, while the CFR among other cases was estimated to lie below 15 %. From June 6, 2015, onwards, the CFR declined 0.3-fold (95 % CI, 0.1\u20131.1) compared to the earlier epidemic period, which may perhaps reflect enhanced case ascertainment following major contact tracing efforts. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of MERS death was significantly associated with older age as well as treatment for underlying diseases after explicitly adjusting for the delay between illness onset and death. Because MERS outbreaks are greatly amplified in the healthcare setting, enhanced infection control practices in medical facilities should strive to shield risk groups from MERS exposure.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizumoto, Kenji; Endo, Akira; Chowell, Gerardo; Miyamatsu, Yuichiro; Saitoh, Masaya; Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bdb53b23deb0bc56d0aa7b26551ab76b1fd082e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4588253.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26420593/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-015-0468-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["risk of MERS death","heterogeneous risk of death","higher risk of death","risks of death","MERS exposure","MERS outbreaks","younger MERS cases","risk factors","risk groups","CFR","treatment","enhanced case ascertainment","medical facilities","healthcare facilities","illness onset","time delay","years","Patients","fold","case fatality ratio","healthcare setting","medical settings","real time","older age","logit model","novel statistical model","enhanced infection control practices","major contact tracing efforts","epidemiological determinants","Middle East respiratory syndrome","order","better understanding","temporal evolution","linear predictor","RESULTS","Senior persons","confidence interval","underlying diseases","accounting","course","CONCLUSIONS","earlier epidemic period","times","Republic of Korea","nosocomial nature","BACKGROUND","METHODS","approach"],"language":"en"},

The discovery of this enzyme added a new level of complexity to this system. The mesangial cells (MC) have multiple functions in glomerular physiology and pathophysiology and are able to express all components of the RAS. Despite of being localized in these cells, ACE2 has not yet been purified or characterized. In this study ACE2 from mice immortalized MC (IMC) was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme was identified as a single band around 60\u201370 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and by Western blotting using a specific antibody. The optima pH and chloride concentrations were 7.5 and 200 mM, respectively. The N-terminal sequence was homologous with many species ACE2 N-terminal sequences as described in the literature. ACE2 purified from IMC was able to hydrolyze Ang II into Ang 1\u20137 and the K(m) value for Ang II was determined to be 2.87 \u00B1 0.76 \u03BCM.

A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise and high fever. During this time several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University (WHUSS). Here, we examined the characteristics of these patients. Methods A total of 96 patients with mean age of 42.24 \u00B1 18.32 years visited General and Emergency Department of WHUSS due to endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020. Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, gender, age, systemic diseases history. Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiological investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, endodontic diagnosis determined for the offending tooth and verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels. Results Of total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment. No patients had fever (\u003E37.2\u00B0C). One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery. Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with mean age of 62.42 \u00B1 13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases. The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45-64 years (30.21%) and patients of this group showed significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6-19 years group and 20-34 years group (p\u003C0.05). The majority of endodontic emergency diagnosis was diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%). Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess showed significantly higher mean VNRS Score than that of other groups (p\u003C0.05). Conclusion Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high risk area than normally. Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time resulting in reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases.

When ectopically expressed in mammalian cells, 8ab induced the proteolysis of ATF6 and the translocation of its cleaved DNA-binding and transcription-activation domains from the ER to the nucleus. Finally, we showed that 8ab binds to the luminal domain of ATF6. These findings suggest that 8ab could modulate the UPR by activating ATF6 to facilitate protein folding and processing.

Rotavirus vaccines presently used are modified live vaccines that lack complete biological safety. Previous work from our laboratory suggested that vaccines based on in situ produced, non-infectious rotavirus-like particles (RVLPs) are efficient while being entirely safe. However, using either vaccine, active mucosal immunization cannot induce protective immunity in newborns due to their immature immune system. We therefore hypothesized that offspring from vaccinated dams are passively immunized either by transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy or by taking up antibodies from milk. Using a codon optimized polycistronic gene expression cassette packaged into herpesvirus particles, the simultaneous expression of the RV capsid genes led to the intracellular formation of RVLPs in various cell lines. Vaccinated dams developed a strong RV specific IgG antibody response determined in sera and milk of both mother and pups. Moreover, sera of na\u00EFve pups nursed by vaccinated dams also had RV specific antibodies suggesting a lactogenic transfer of antibodies. Although full protection of pups was not achieved in this mouse model, our observations are important for the development of improved vaccines against RV in humans as well as in various animal species.","publish_time":"2017-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meier, Anita F.; Suter, Mark; Schraner, Elisabeth M.; Humbel, Bruno M.; Tobler, Kurt; Ackermann, Mathias; Laimbacher, Andrea S.","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e8e102a4453c1bf7d9d4886d32d6aa1bebb3e53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5343965.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212334/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms18020431","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rotaviruses"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV specific antibodies","vaccinated dams","Rotavirus vaccines","live vaccines","lactogenic transfer of antibodies","transfer of maternal antibodies","RV capsid genes","development of improved vaccines","sera of na\u00EFve pups","milk","protection of pups","strong RV specific IgG antibody response","simultaneous expression","herpesvirus particles","non-infectious rotavirus","important enteric pathogens of newborn humans","intracellular formation of RVLPs","various cell lines","various animal species","codon optimized polycistronic gene expression cassette","newborns","diarrhea","animals","protective immunity","active mucosal immunization","rare cases death","observations","RVs","complete biological safety","pregnancy","mouse model","immature immune system","Rotaviruses","laboratory","situ","offspring","mother","young individuals","Previous work"],"language":"en"},

Objective We sought to explore the relationship between viral infections, host and environmental factors, and respiratory symptoms in children. Methods Sixty-seven asthmatic children collected samples twice weekly for an average of 10 weeks. These included nasal wash fluid and exhaled breath for PCR-based detection of viral RNA, lung function measurements, and records of medication use and asthma and respiratory symptoms in the previous 3 days. Atopy, mite allergen exposure, and vitamin D levels were also measured. Mixed-model regression analyses were performed. Results Human rhinoviruses (hRVs) were detected in 25.5% of 1232 nasal samples and 11.5% of breath samples. Non-hRV viruses were detected in less than 3% of samples. hRV in nasal samples was associated with asthma symptoms (cough and phlegm: odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.4-2.86, P = .0001; wheeze and chest tightness: odds ratio = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.55-3.52, P \u003C .0001) and with cold symptoms, as reported concurrently with sampling and 3 to 4 days later. No differences were found between the 3 hRV genotypes (hRV-A, hRV-B, and hRV-C) in symptom risk. A history of inhaled corticosteroid use, but not atopic status, mite allergen exposure, or vitamin D levels, modified the association between viruses and asthma symptoms. Conclusion The detection of nasal hRV was associated with a significantly increased risk of day-to-day asthma symptoms in children. Host, virus genotype, and environmental factors each had only a small or no effect on the relationship of viral infections to asthma symptoms.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tovey, Euan R.; Stelzer-Braid, Sacha; Toelle, Brett G.; Oliver, Brian G.; Reddel, Helen K.; Willenborg, Christiana M.; Belessis, Yvonne; Garden, Frances L.; Jaffe, Adam; Strachan, Roxanne; Eyles, Darryl; Rawlinson, William D.; Marks, Guy B.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6260b18fb69382b9c79d5a9ff85e84518cfc37e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173323.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25476729/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674914015152; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674914015152; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2014.10.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","nasal samples","detection of nasal hRV","cold symptoms","hRV-C","hRV-B","hRV genotypes","Non-hRV viruses","increased risk of day-to-day asthma symptoms","breath samples","acute exacerbations of asthma","relationship of viral infections","mite allergen exposure","environmental factors","vitamin D levels","odds ratio","host","nasal wash fluid","symptom risk","asthmatic children","Background Viruses","days","PCR-based detection of viral RNA","exhaled breath","level of day-to-day symptom control","records of medication use","history of inhaled corticosteroid use","lung function measurements","atopic status","association","wheeze","cough","phlegm","chest tightness","virus genotype","effect","Mixed-model regression analyses","Atopy","Methods","Conclusion","Human rhinoviruses","hRVs","average","extent","sampling","weeks","Objective","differences"],"language":"en"},

In addition, we determined whether EVD-related stigma is a predictor of informal health care use among EVD survivors. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 358 EVD survivors in five districts across all four geographic regions (Western Area, Northern Province, Eastern Province and Southern Province) of Sierra Leone. Ebola-related stigma was measured by adapting the validated HIV related stigma for people living with HIV/AIDS instrument. We also measured traditional and complementary medicine (T\u0026CM) use (as a measure of informal healthcare use). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. RESULTS: EVD survivors report higher levels of internalised stigma (0.92 \u00B1 0.77) compared to total enacted stigma (0.71 \u00B1 0.61). Social isolation (0.96 \u00B1 0.88) was the highest reported enacted stigma subscale. Ebola survivors who identified as Christians [AOR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.15\u20135.49, p = 0.021], who perceived their health to be fair/poor [AOR = 2.58, 95%CI: 1.39\u20134.77. p = 0.003] and who reside in the northern region of Sierra Leone [AOR = 2.80, 95%CI: 1.29\u20136.07, p = 0.009] were more likely to experience internalised stigma. Verbal abuse [AOR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.09\u20133.49, p = 0.025] and healthcare neglect [AOR = 2.35, 95%CI: 1.37\u20134.02, p = 0.002] were independent predictors of T\u0026CM use among EVD survivors. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest EVD-related stigma (internalised and enacted) is prevalent among EVD survivors since their return to their communities. Religiosity, perceived health status and region were identified as independent predictors of internalised stigma. Verbal abuse and healthcare neglect predict informal healthcare use. EVD survivor-centred and community-driven anti-stigma programs are needed to promote EVD survivors\u2019 recovery and community re-integration.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"James, Peter Bai; Wardle, Jonathan; Steel, Amie; Adams, Jon","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38a33f302357e8dced322858ad61fe20b876d445.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7001224.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-8279-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32020858/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Western Area","Eastern Province","Southern Province","Sierra Leone"],"keyphrases":["EVD-related stigma","Ebola-related stigma","Ebola survivors","total enacted stigma","AOR","validated HIV related stigma","independent predictors of internalised stigma","EVD survivors\u2019 recovery","EVD survivor-centred","anti-stigma programs","higher levels of internalised stigma","highest reported enacted stigma subscale","measure of informal healthcare use","healthcare neglect","predictor of informal health care use","Northern Province","northern region of Sierra Leone","Eastern Province","Southern Province","independent predictors of T","return","perceived health status","Verbal abuse","communities","correlates of Ebola virus disease","community re-integration","people","Western Area","geographic regions","magnitude","descriptive statistics","Religiosity","cross-sectional study","districts","RESULTS","poor","findings","Christians","complementary medicine","regression analysis","AIDS instrument","Data","METHODS","CONCLUSION","Social isolation","BACKGROUND","addition"],"language":"en"},

Projections of rising greenhouse gas emissions suggest increasing direct and indirect burden of infectious and noninfectious disease, effects on food and water security, and other societal disruptions. As the effects of climate change cannot be isolated from social and ecological determinants of disease that will mitigate or exacerbate forecasted health outcomes, multidisciplinary collaboration is critically needed. Objectives The aim of this article was to review the links between climate change and its upstream drivers (ie, processes leading to greenhouse gas emissions) and health outcomes, and identify existing opportunities to leverage more integrated global health and climate actions to prevent, prepare for, and respond to anthropogenic pressures. Methods We conducted a literature review of current and projected health outcomes associated with climate change, drawing on findings and our collective expertise to review opportunities for adaptation and mitigation across disciplines. Findings Health outcomes related to climate change affect a wide range of stakeholders, providing ready collaborative opportunities for interventions, which can be differentiated by addressing the upstream drivers leading to climate change or the downstream effects of climate change itself. Conclusions Although health professionals are challenged with risks from climate change and its drivers, the adverse health outcomes cannot be resolved by the public health community alone. A phase change in global health is needed to move from a passive responder in partnership with other societal sectors to drive innovative alternatives. It is essential for global health to step outside of its traditional boundaries to engage with other stakeholders to develop policy and practical solutions to mitigate disease burden of climate change and its drivers; this will also yield compound benefits that help address other health, environmental, and societal challenges.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Machalaba, Catherine; Romanelli, Cristina; Stoett, Peter; Baum, Sarah E.; Bouley, Timothy A.; Daszak, Peter; Karesh, William B.","journal":"Annals of Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f4905d8328d39f1001b6ea1ca3f4fae13d230a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128244.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aogh.2015.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26615080/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214999615012187; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214999615012187","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health of humans","health professionals","Findings Health outcomes","disease burden of climate change","projected health outcomes","downstream effects of climate change","forecasted health outcomes","adverse health outcomes","Abstract Background Climate change","climate actions","phase change","integrated global health","public health community","upstream drivers","noninfectious disease","existing opportunities","societal sectors","ecological determinants of disease","societal disruptions","societal challenges","ecological processes","ready collaborative opportunities","literature review of current","Projections of rising greenhouse gas emissions","indirect burden of infectious","wide range of stakeholders","myriad implications","water security","practical solutions","adaptation","food","risks","partnership","collective expertise","policy","ecosystems","multidisciplinary collaboration","links","passive responder","article","innovative alternatives","mitigation","disciplines","interventions","traditional boundaries","compound benefits","Objectives","aim","Methods","Conclusions","anthropogenic pressures"],"language":"en"},

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a widespread avian coronavirus, whose control relies mainly on extensive vaccine administration. Unfortunately, the continuous emergence of new vaccine-immunity escaping variants prompts the development of new vaccines. In the present work, a molecular epidemiology study was performed to evaluate the potential role of homologous vaccination in driving IBV evolution. This was undertaken by assessing IBV viral RNA sequences from the ORF encoding the S1 portion of viral surface glycoprotein (S) before and after the introduction of a new live vaccine on broiler farms in northern-Italy. The results of several biostatistics analyses consistently demonstrate the presence of a higher pressure in the post-vaccination period. Natural selection was detected essentially on sites located on the protein surface, within or nearby domains involved in viral attachment or related functions. This evidence strongly supports the action of vaccine-induced immunity in conditioning viral evolution, potentially leading to the emergence of new vaccine-escape variants. The great plasticity of rapidly-evolving RNA-viruses in response to human intervention, which extends beyond the poultry industry, is demonstrated, claiming further attention due to their relevance for animal and especially human health.","publish_time":"2019-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franzo, Giovanni; Legnardi, Matteo; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Drigo, Michele; Martini, Marco; Cecchinato, Mattia","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8e6c1da1ba9b222863bb9369bfc92a7a908b6e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6842459.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31706335/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-019-0713-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new live vaccine","action of vaccine","vaccine resistance","continuous emergence of new vaccine-immunity","emergence of new vaccine-escape variants","episodes of vaccine failure","extensive vaccine administration","viral attachment","IBV viral RNA sequences","conditioning viral evolution","driving IBV evolution","development of new vaccines","S1 portion of viral surface glycoprotein","induced immunity","protein surface","human intervention","human health","evolving RNA-viruses","post-vaccination period","potential role of homologous vaccination","ORF","control","broiler farms","nearby domains","higher pressure","response","molecular epidemiology study","widespread avian coronavirus","presence","present work","relevance","animal","northern-Italy","rare phenomenon","introduction","increasing frequency","related functions","Infectious bronchitis virus","biostatistics analyses","great plasticity","results","livestock","attention","sites","fact","evidence","poultry industry"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN: Children 1 month to 21 years with COVID-19 from a single tertiary care children\u2019s hospital between March 15-April 13, 2020 were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: 67 children tested positive for COVID-19; 21 (31.3%) were managed as outpatients. Of 46 admitted patients, 33 (72%) were admitted to the general pediatric medical unit and 13 (28%) to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Obesity and asthma were highly prevalent but not significantly associated with PICU admission (p=0.99). Admission to the PICU was significantly associated with higher C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels and platelet counts (p\u003C0.05 for all). Patients in the PICU were more likely to require high-flow nasal cannula (p=0.0001) and were more likely to have received Remdesivir through compassionate release (p\u003C0.05). Severe sepsis and septic shock syndromes were observed in 7 (53.8%) PICU patients.

It is important to characterize a virus at the nucleotide level to discover the virus\u2019s genomic sequence variations and similarities relative to other viruses that could have an impact on the functions of its genes and proteins. This entails a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the viral genomes of interest for preferred nucleotides, codon bias, nucleotide changes at the 3rd position (NT3s), synonymous codon usage and relative synonymous codon usage. In this study, the variations in the N proteins among 13 different coronaviruses (CoVs) were analysed at the nucleotide and amino acid levels in an attempt to reveal how these viruses adapt to their hosts relative to their preferred codon usage in the N genes. The results revealed that, overall, eighteen amino acids had different preferred codons and eight of these were over-biased. The N genes had a higher AT% over GC% and the values of their effective number of codons ranged from 40.43 to 53.85, indicating a slight codon bias. Neutrality plots and correlation analyses showed a very high level of GC3s/GC correlation in porcine epidemic diarrhea CoV (pedCoV), followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS CoV), porcine delta CoV (dCoV), bat CoV (bCoV) and feline CoV (fCoV) with r values 0.81, 0.68, -0.47, 0.98 and 0.58, respectively. These data implied a high rate of evolution of the CoV genomes and a strong influence of mutation on evolutionary selection in the CoV N genes. This type of genetic analysis would be useful for evaluating a virus\u2019s host adaptation, evolution and is thus of value to vaccine design strategies.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheikh, Abdullah; Al-Taher, Abdulla; Al-Nazawi, Mohammed; Al-Mubarak, Abdullah I.; Kandeel, Mahmoud","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3bab018abb2a85187d060dbcd0edc154fc01906.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119019.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31911390/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093418305809; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093418305809; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113806","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CoV N"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV N genes","CoV genomes","MERS CoV","feline CoV","bat CoV","porcine delta CoV","preferred codon usage","N proteins","relative synonymous codon usage","porcine epidemic diarrhea CoV","slight codon bias","nucleotide level","Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV","different preferred codons","GC correlation","similarities relative","preferred nucleotides","hosts relative","nucleotide changes","high level of GC3s","high rate of evolution","correlation analyses","viral genomes","virus\u2019s genomic sequence variations","virus assembly","amino acids","different coronaviruses","comparative analysis","r values","virus\u2019s host adaptation","amino acid levels","effective number of codons","type of genetic analysis","evolutionary selection","pedCoV","strong influence of mutation","bCoV","fCoV","position","NT3s","crucial role","attempt","CoVs","vaccine design strategies","RNA transcription","Neutrality plots","data","impact","functions","nucleocapsid","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Besides the influenza, several other pathogens are responsible for acute respiratory infection in children. Etiology of infections is poorly characterized at the course of clinical management, and hence empirical antimicrobial agents are used. The objective of this study was to characterize the influenza and other respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR assay. A total of 175 throat swab specimens of influenza-positive cases collected at National Influenza Center, Nepal, during the 2015/16 winter season were selected for detecting other respiratory copathogens. Total nucleic acid was extracted using Pure Link viral RNA/DNA mini kit (Invitrogen), and multiplex RT-PCR assays were performed. Influenza A and B viruses were found in 120 (68.6%) and 55 (31.4%) specimens, respectively, among which coinfections were found in 106 (60.6%) specimens. Among the influenza A-positive cases, 25 (20.8%) were A/H1N1 pdm09 and 95 (79.2%) were A/H3 subtypes. Viruses coinfected frequently with influenza virus in children were rhinovirus (26; 14.8%), respiratory syncytial virus A/B (19; 10.8%), adenovirus (14; 8.0%), coronavirus (CoV)-HKU1 (14; 8.0%), CoV-OC43 (5; 2.9%), CoV-229E (2; 1.1%), metapneumovirus A/B (5; 2.9%), bocavirus (6; 3.4%), enterovirus (5; 2.9%), parainfluenza virus-1 (3; 1.7%), and parainfluenza virus-3 (2; 1.1%). Coinfection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae with influenza virus was found in children (5; 2.8%). Most of the viral infection occurred in young children below 5 years of age. In addition to influenza virus, nine different respiratory pathogens were detected, of which coinfections of rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus A/B were predominantly found in children.

However, clinical research is rapidly progressing, as shown by the hundreds of registered clinical trials on candidate drugs for COVID-19. Unfortunately, information on protocols of individual studies differs from registry to registry. Furthermore, study designs, criteria for stratification of patients and choice of outcomes are quite heterogeneous. All this makes data sharing and secondary analysis difficult.At last, small single centre studies and the use of drugs on a compassionate basis should be replaced by highly powered, multi-centre, multi-arm clinical trials, in orderto provide the required evidence of safety and efficacy of novel or repurposed candidate drugs. Hopefully, the efforts of clinical researchers in the fight against the SARS Cov-2 will result into the identification of effective treatments. To make this possible, clinical research should be oriented by guidelines for more harmonized high-quality studies and by a united commitment of the scientific community to share personal knowledge and data.

We conducted an analysis of the literature and characterized the linkage between animal and human health data. We discuss the findings in relation to zoonotic surveillance and the linkage of human and animal data. METHODS: The Canary Database, an online bibliographic database of animal-sentinel studies was searched and articles were classified according to four linkage categories. RESULTS: 465 studies were identified and assigned to linkage categories involving: descriptive, analytic, molecular, or no human outcomes of human and animal health. Descriptive linkage was the most common, whereby both animal and human health outcomes were presented, but without quantitative linkage between the two. Rarely, analytic linkage was utilized in which animal data was used to quantitatively predict human risk. The other two categories included molecular linkage, and no human outcomes, which present health outcomes in animals but not humans. DISCUSSION: We found limited use of animal data to quantitatively predict human risk and listed the methods from the literature that performed analytic linkage. The lack of analytic linkage in the literature might not be solely related to technological barriers including access to electronic database, statistical software packages, and Geographical Information System (GIS). Rather, the problem might be from a lack of understanding by researchers of the importance of animal data as a \u0027sentinel\u0027 for human health. Researchers performing zoonotic surveillance should be aware of the value of animal-sentinel approaches for predicting human risk and consider analytic methods for linking animal and human data.

Recently the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular homeostatic response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, has emerged to be a major contributing factor in many human diseases. It is also evident that viruses interact with the host UPR in many different ways and the outcome could be pro-viral, anti-viral or pathogenic, depending on the particular type of infection.

Sensitivity ranged from 17\u201394% for swabs and 33\u201384% for tissues. Sensitivity was highest for RSV (94% swabs and 84% tissues). Specificity was \u2265 95% for all viruses except HRV for both collection methods. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity of anterior nare swabs and facial tissues in the detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR varied by virus type. Given its simplicity and specificity, non-invasive sampling for PCR testing may be useful for conducting epidemiologic or surveillance studies in settings where invasive testing is impractical or not feasible.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blaschke, Anne J.; Allison, Mandy A.; Meyers, Lindsay; Rogatcheva, Margarita; Heyrend, Caroline; Mallin, Brittany; Carter, Marjorie; LaFleur, Bonnie; Barney, Trenda; Poritz, Mark A.; Daly, Judy A.; Byington, Carrie L.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24ef46ecfbe22b27e816ea4c747f1de24477ab98.json; document_parses/pdf_json/81cf33681ddf2590a88e6db51098317181f89d55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3196801.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653211003143; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653211003143; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3196801?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21855405/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2011.07.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","NPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["facial tissues","respiratory virus detection","NPA sample","specificity of swabs","facial tissue-NPA pairs","detection of respiratory viruses","Respiratory syncytial virus","multiplex PCR","swab-NPA pairs","respiratory symptoms","respiratory pathogens","PCR testing","Sensitivity of anterior nare swabs","virus infections","collection methods","PCR technology","virus type","tissue samples","utility of non-invasive sample collection","non-invasive sampling methods","invasive testing","RSV","Children","HRV","Viral detection rates","populations","settings","surveillance studies","pediatric emergency department","years","human rhinovirus","month","CONCLUSIONS","nasopharyngeal aspirate","STUDY DESIGN","BACKGROUND","simplicity","OBJECTIVES","gold standard","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Direct antigen detection (DAD) is rapid, but lacks sensitivity, whereas nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) is more sensitive, but also more time-consuming. Objectives To evaluate the performance of a rapid isothermal NAT and two DADs. Study design During February\u2013May 2014, we tested 211 consecutive patients with influenza-like illness using a commercial isothermal NAT (Alere\u2122 Influenza A\u0026B) as well as the DAD Sofia\u00AE Influenza A\u002BB and BinaxNOW\u00AE Influenza A\u0026B for detection of influenza-A and -B virus. RespiFinder-22\u00AE a commercial multiplex NAT served as reference test. Serial 10-fold dilutions of influenza-A and -B cell culture supernatants were examined. Another 225 patient samples were tested during December 2014\u2013February 2015. Results Compared to RespiFinder-22\u00AE, the isothermal NAT Alere\u2122 Influenza A\u0026B, and the DAD Sofia\u00AE Influenza A\u002BB and BinaxNOW\u00AE Influenza A\u0026B had sensitivities of 77.8%, 59.3% and 29.6%, and specificities of 99.5%, 98.9% and 100%, respectively, for the first 211 patient samples. Alere\u2122 Influenza A\u0026B showed 85.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the second cohort. Isothermal NAT was 10-100-fold more sensitive compared to DAD for influenza virus culture supernatants with a lower limit of detection of 5000\u201350,000 copies/mL.

The present study allowed the exploration of the potential chemical space, around these new scaffolds, that are well tolerated for maintaining the antiviral effect by means of interaction with the hDHFR enzyme. The new derivatives confirmed their inhibitory profile against influenza viruses, especially type B. In particular, the two best compounds shared potent antiviral activity (4: EC50 = 0.29 \u03BCM; 6: EC50 = 0.19 \u03BCM), which was comparable to that of zanamivir (EC50 = 0.14 \u03BCM), and better than that of ribavirin (EC50 = 3.2 \u03BCM).

In particular, it is critical to monitor the appearance of any new emerging subtypes. Comparative phyloinformatics can be used to monitor, analyze, and possibly predict the evolution of viruses. However, in order to utilize the full functionality of available analysis packages for large-scale phyloinformatics studies, a team of computer scientists, biostatisticians and virologists is needed \u2013 a requirement which cannot be fulfilled in many cases. Furthermore, the time complexities of many algorithms involved leads to prohibitive runtimes on sequential computer platforms. This has so far hindered the use of comparative phyloinformatics as a commonly applied tool in this area. RESULTS: In this paper the graphical-oriented workflow design system called Quascade and its efficient usage for comparative phyloinformatics are presented. In particular, we focus on how this task can be effectively performed in a distributed computing environment. As a proof of concept, the designed workflows are used for the phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase of H5N1 isolates (micro level) and influenza viruses (macro level). The results of this paper are hence twofold. Firstly, this paper demonstrates the usefulness of a graphical user interface system to design and execute complex distributed workflows for large-scale phyloinformatics studies of virus genes. Secondly, the analysis of neuraminidase on different levels of complexity provides valuable insights of this virus\u0027s tendency for geographical based clustering in the phylogenetic tree and also shows the importance of glycan sites in its molecular evolution. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates the efficiency and utility of workflow systems providing a biologist friendly approach to complex biological dataset analysis using high performance computing. In particular, the utility of the platform Quascade for deploying distributed and parallelized versions of a variety of computationally intensive phylogenetic algorithms has been shown. Secondly, the analysis of the utilized H5N1 neuraminidase datasets at macro and micro levels has clearly indicated a pattern of spatial clustering of the H5N1 viral isolates based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host range based clustering.","publish_time":"2008-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Dadabhai T; Trehan, Rahul; Schmidt, Bertil; Bretschneider, Timo","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/111968f7fb102882c193488965e41d5d0f0103dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2259424.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-s1-s23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18315855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase","H5N1 isolates","use of comparative phyloinformatics","paper","geographical based clustering","subtype H5N1","influenza viruses","evolution of viruses","H5N1 viral isolates","complex distributed workflows","complex biological dataset analysis","utilized H5N1 neuraminidase datasets","large-scale phyloinformatics studies of virus genes","micro levels","functionality of available analysis packages","macro level","phylogenetic tree","intensive phylogenetic algorithms","distributed computing environment","RESULTS","graphical-oriented workflow design system","utility of workflow systems","pattern of spatial clustering","geographical distribution","platform Quascade","graphical user interface system","designed workflows","pathogenic influenza","global priority","molecular evolution","different levels of complexity","team of computer scientists","high performance computing","sequential computer platforms","possible global pandemic","biologist friendly approach","valuable insights","virus\u0027s tendency","variety","efficient usage","prohibitive runtimes","efficiency","parallelized versions","temporal","usefulness","host range","importance of glycan sites","appearance","virologists","current study","Preparedness","biostatisticians","applied tool","new emerging subtypes","BACKGROUND","proof of concept","CONCLUSION","area","time complexities","requirement","order","cases","task"],"language":"en"},

Serum samples from 120 piglets and faecal samples from 36 piglets were longitudinally collected at 1, 3, 7, 11 and 15 weeks of age. Serum samples from their dams (n =30) were also taken 1-week post-farrowing. PToV antibodies in serum were monitored by ELISA, while viral infection was assessed by real-time RT-PCR in faeces. A high seroprevalence (about 100%) was observed in animals older than 11 weeks and in adult sows. Moreover, all 1-week-old animals were seropositive, indicating maternal antibody transference through colostrum. The antibody titers declined to close to or below the ELISA cut-off value by the age of weaning (3 weeks of age). Development of a significant antibody response to PToV occurred before 7 weeks of age in about 50% of piglets, and the remaining animals developed the response by weeks 11 or 15. These results indicate that PToV infection occurred soon after weaning. Although the prevalence of infection in suckling piglets varied among the studied farms, PToV prevalences in 7 and 11-week-old pigs were between 50\u201367% and 58\u201375%, respectively, in all farms. Sequencing results indicated that more than one PToV strains were circulating in the studied farms. Present data suggest that PToV was endemic on the studied farms, and provide new insights on the epidemiology of PToV.","publish_time":"2010-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pignatelli, J.; Grau-Roma, L.; Jim\u00E9nez, M.; Segal\u00E9s, J.; Rodr\u00EDguez, D.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e4242495a8915c3350af20f68e9d3b691b27075.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127003.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113510002506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20542392/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113510002506; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.05.023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["PToV infection","PToV prevalences","epidemiology of PToV","PToV antibodies","PToV strains","weeks of age","studied farms","Serum samples","age of weaning","suckling piglets","viral infection","prevalence of infection","week-old animals","multi-site farms","faecal samples","significant antibody response","remaining animals","animals older","antibody titers","maternal antibody transference","high seroprevalence","week-old pigs","Sequencing results","ELISA cut-off value","new insights","porcine torovirus","real-time RT-PCR","North-eastern region of Spain","faeces","colostrum","Development","Present data","dams","adult sows","week post-farrowing","study"],"language":"en"},

Blood samples were taken approximately 60 d after the outbreak. Antibody levels were quantified as the sample-to-positive ratio (S/P ratio) using a fluorescent microsphere assay. Reproductive traits included total number born (TNB), number born alive (NBA), number stillborn (NSB), number mummified (NBM), and number born dead (NBD). Mortality traits were log transformed for genetic analyses. Data were split into prior, during, and after the disease outbreak phases using visual appraisal of the estimates of farm-year-week effects for each reproductive trait. For NBA, data from all phases were combined into a reaction norm analysis with regression on estimates of farm-year-week effects for NBA. Heritability for S/P ratio was estimated at 0.17 \u00B1 0.05. Heritability estimates for reproduction traits were all low and were lower during the outbreak for NBA but greater for mortality traits. TNB was not greatly affected during the outbreak, as many sows that farrowed during the outbreak were mated prior to the outbreak. Heritability for TNB decreased from 0.13 (prior) to 0.08 (after). Genetic correlation estimates between prior to and during the outbreak were high for TNB (0.86 \u00B1 0.23) and NBA (0.98 \u00B1 0.38) but lower for mortality traits: 0.65 \u00B1 0.43, \u22120.42 \u00B1 0.55, and 0.29 \u00B1 1.39 for LNSB, LNBM, and LNBD, respectively. TNB prior to and after the outbreak had a lower genetic correlation (0.32 \u00B1 0.33). In general, genetic correlation estimates of S/P ratio with reproductive performance during the outbreak were below 0.20 in absolute value, except for LNSB (\u22120.73 \u00B1 0.29). Based on the reaction norm model, estimates of genetic correlations between the intercept and slope terms ranged from 0.24 \u00B1 0.50 to 0.54 \u00B1 0.35 depending on the parameterization used, indicating that selection for the intercept may result in indirect selection for steeper slopes, and thus, less resilient animals. In general, estimates of genetic correlations between farm-year-week effect classes based on the reaction norm model resembled estimates of genetic correlations from the multivariate analysis. Overall, compared to previous studies, antibody S/P ratios showed a lower heritability (0.17 \u00B1 0.05) and low genetic correlations with reproductive performance during a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome outbreak, except for the LNSB.","publish_time":"2018-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Putz, Austin M; Schwab, Clint R; Sewell, Alysta D; Holtkamp, Derald J; Zimmerman, Jeffery J; Baker, Kimberlee; Ser\u00E3o, Nick V L; Dekkers, Jack C M","journal":"Journal of Animal Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/617b01b938c5c67af82e85e296644c29c890a3b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6396237.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/sky485; https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/97/3/1101/28000112/sky485.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30590720/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["S/P","TNB","NBA","LNSB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reproductive traits","genetic correlation estimates of S","Heritability estimates","estimates of farm","lower genetic correlation","low genetic correlations","genetic analyses","NBA","TNB","respiratory syndrome outbreak","reproductive performance","Mortality traits","reaction norm model resembled estimates of genetic correlations","disease outbreak phases","lower heritability","antibody S","genetic parameters of antibody response","reproduction traits","farm-year","number stillborn","number mummified","total number","LNSB","year-week effects","reaction norm analysis","P ratios","positive ratio","Antibody levels","intercept","Data","week effect classes","respiratory syndrome virus","multivariate analysis","indirect selection","exposure","visual appraisal","regression","previous studies","log","fluorescent microsphere assay","steeper slopes","slope terms","dead","study","absolute value","Blood samples","LNBM","LNBD","sows","resilient animals","objective","parameterization"],"language":"en"},

While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics. For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents. HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses. HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine. The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century. New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host associations of the MERS coronavirus.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corman, Victor M.; Muth, Doreen; Niemeyer, Daniela; Drosten, Christian","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26463e08b48df330c50a98c7b7acfdadb1895198.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112090.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352718300010; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2018.01.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352718300010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29551135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-OC43","HCoV-NL63","endemic human coronaviruses HCoV","MERS coronavirus","primordial associations","HKU1","bovine coronavirus","present prepandemic pattern of host associations","rodent-associated viruses","important insights","important ecological parallels","Middle East respiratory syndrome","lower respiratory tract infections","natural history of past human pandemics","origin","major livestock species","dromedary camels similar","considerable share of upper","adults","evolutionary histories","strong evidence","domestic animals","cattle","children","agents","ancestors","swine","scenario","bat reservoirs","New data","possible ancestor","bats","context","clinical representation","century","rodents"],"language":"en"},

However, there are few studies of the etiological structure of ARIs in Russia. In this work, we analyzed the etiology of ARIs in children (0\u201315 years old) admitted to Novosibirsk Children\u2019s Municipal Clinical Hospital in 2013\u20132017. METHODS: We tested nasal and throat swabs of 1560 children with upper or lower respiratory infection for main respiratory viruses (influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, four human coronaviruses, rhinovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus) using a RT-PCR Kit. RESULTS: We detected 1128 (72.3%) samples were positive for at least one virus. The most frequently detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (358/1560, 23.0%), influenza virus (344/1560, 22.1%), and rhinovirus (235/1560, 15.1%). Viral co-infections were found in 163 out of the 1128 (14.5%) positive samples. We detected significant decrease of the respiratory syncytial virus-infection incidence in children with increasing age, while the reverse relationship was observed for influenza viruses. CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated the distribution of respiratory viruses in children with ARIs and showed the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus in the etiological structure of infections. This study is important for the improvement and optimization of diagnostic tactics, control and prevention of the respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2018-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kurskaya, Olga; Ryabichenko, Tatyana; Leonova, Natalya; Shi, Weifeng; Bi, Hongtao; Sharshov, Kirill; Kazachkova, Eugenia; Sobolev, Ivan; Prokopyeva, Elena; Kartseva, Tatiana; Alekseev, Alexander; Shestopalov, Alexander","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/462c15b07dd915107b852ace8f6c49eb53fc9a9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6143185.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30226876/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARIs"],"organizations":["Novosibirsk Children\u2019s Municipal Clinical Hospital"],"locations":["Russia"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory viral infections","respiratory syncytial virus-infection incidence","main respiratory viruses","distribution of respiratory viruses","Acute respiratory infections","lower respiratory infection","influenza viruses","parainfluenza virus types","etiological structure of ARIs","etiological structure of infections","etiology of ARIs","Viral co-infections","rhinovirus","detected pathogens","positive samples","increasing age","control","human coronaviruses","prevention","metapneumovirus","improvement","Novosibirsk Children\u2019s Municipal Clinical Hospital","optimization of diagnostic tactics","bocavirus","adenovirus","reverse relationship","throat swabs","years old","considerable morbidity","BACKGROUND","significant decrease","RT-PCR Kit","mortality","studies","Russia","study","METHODS","work","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hMPV, HCoV NL63 and HBoV in South African children with acute wheezing. A prospective study of consecutive children presenting with acute wheezing to a pediatric hospital from May 2004 to November 2005 was undertaken. A nasal swab was taken for reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) and PCR for hMPV, HCoV NL63 and HBoV; when positive, the genes were sequenced. Shell vial culture for RSV, influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 was performed on every 5th sample. Two hundred and forty two nasal swabs were collected from 238 children (median age 12.4 months). A novel respiratory virus was found in 44/242 (18.2%). hMPV, HBoV, and HCoV NL63 was found in 20 (8.3%), 18 (7.4%), and 6 (2.4%) of samples, respectively. Fifteen of 59 (25%) samples were positive for other respiratory viruses. Viral co\u2010infections, occurred in 6/242 (2.5%). Phylogenetic analysis showed co\u2010circulation of hMPV and HCoV NL63 A and B lineages, although only HBoV genotype st2 was found. Viruses are an important cause of wheezing in preschool children; hMPV, HCoV NL63, and HBoV are less common than the usual respiratory pathogens. J. Med.

In the 14th Century alone, infectious diseases were responsible for decimating 20\u201345% of the world\u0027s population. The discovery of vaccines, coupled with improved sanitation, hygiene, and health care, witnessed the eradication of several infectious diseases, although some have resurfaced or are resurfacing since the latter part of the 20th Century. While geography partly define hotspots for emerging and infectious diseases, low socioeconomic development, poverty, and underfunded health care systems remain driving forces for the reoccurrence of these diseases among vulnerable populations who experience material deprivation. To eradicate infectious diseases, a global response will have to prioritize the allocation of resources by way of expertise and technology to areas that are most affected. Furthermore, an effective surveillance system, and a rigorous vaccine deployment regime targeting vulnerable persons and regions is desirable in mitigating the impacts of these diseases.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antabe, Roger; Ziegler, Bianca Rosa","journal":"International Encyclopedia of Human Geography","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acc9960f29bf77b9c7d05dbcb78fd22df7017cbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153343.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780081022955104391; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081022955104391","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious diseases","world\u0027s population","Century","underfunded health care systems","serious health threats","vulnerable persons","vulnerable populations","global response","leading causes of global morbidity","poverty","rigorous vaccine deployment regime","low socioeconomic development","driving forces","regions","reoccurrence","technology","way of expertise","improved sanitation","viruses","parasites","areas","allocation of resources","effective surveillance system","mortality","hygiene","hotspots","eradication","material deprivation","pathogens","bacteria","ancient Egypt","impacts","discovery of vaccines","fungi","geography"],"language":"en"},

The MASP2 gene encodes two proteins, MASP-2 and MAp19. MASP-2 is the serine protease responsible for lectin pathway activation. The smaller alternative splice product, MAp19, lacks a catalytic domain but retains two of three domains involved in association with the pattern-recognition molecules (PRMs): mannan-binding lectin (MBL), H-ficolin, L-ficolin and M-ficolin. MAp19 reportedly acts as a competitive inhibitor of MASP-2-mediated complement activation. In light of a ten times lower affinity of MAp19, versus MASP-2, for association with the PRMs, much higher serum concentrations of MAp19 than MASP-2 would be required for MAp19 to exert such an inhibitory activity. Just four amino acid residues distinguish MAp19 from MASP-2, and these are conserved between man, mouse and rat. Nonetheless we generated monoclonal rat anti-MAp19 antibodies and established a quantitative assay. We found the concentration of MAp19 in serum to be 217 ng/ml, i.e., 11 nM, comparable to the 7 nM of MASP-2. In serum all MASP-2, but only a minor fraction of MAp19, was associated with PRMs. In contrast to previous reports we found that MAp19 could not compete with MASP-2 for binding to MBL, nor could it inhibit MASP-2-mediated complement activation. Immunohistochemical analyses combined with qRT-PCR revealed that both MAp19 and MASP-2 were mainly expressed in hepatocytes. High levels of MAp19 were found in urine, where MASP-2 was absent.","publish_time":"2011-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Degn, S\u00F8ren E.; Thiel, Steffen; Nielsen, Ole; Hansen, Annette G.; Steffensen, Rudi; Jensenius, Jens C.","journal":"J Immunol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d9367cb4a0ca0c978b1aabf66720cf9498489d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099877.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175911002110; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2011.08.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175911002110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21871896/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["concentration of MAp19","nM of MASP","High levels of MAp19","minor fraction of MAp19","competitive inhibitor of MASP","higher serum concentrations of MAp19","times lower affinity of MAp19","monoclonal rat anti-MAp19 antibodies","PRMs","lectin pathway activation","lectin pathway of complement","mediated complement activation","mannan-binding lectin","MBL","association","H-ficolin","serine protease responsible","pattern-recognition molecules","qRT-PCR","smaller alternative splice product","innate immunity","proteins","amino acid residues","quantitative assay","powerful inducer of inflammation","Immunohistochemical analyses","light","domains","previous reports","MASP2 gene","catalytic domain","urine","contrast","mouse","inhibitory activity","hepatocytes"],"language":"en"},

A population census survey was conducted in Nha-Trang and Ninh-Hoa to collect demographic, social-behavioral data and disease burden on SPID. The study site covered a population of 353,525 residing in 75,826 households with 24,781 children less than 5 years. Hospital databases from two hospitals covering the region were obtained. Linking the census and hospital databases, we were able to investigate on a variety of SPID such as environmental tobacco smoking exposure and increased risked of pediatric pneumonia hospitalization, population density, water supply and risk of dengue fever and animal livestock and risk of hospitalized diarrhea. To determine incidence, viral etiology and risk factors for pediatric ARI/pneumonia, we setup a population based prospective hospitalized Pediatric ARI surveillance at Khanh Hoa General Hospital, Nha-Trang in February 2007. The study has revealed RSV, rhinovirus and influenza A as major viral pathogens, role of multiple viral infection and its interaction with bacteria in the development of pneumonia.

An expression has been articulated to identify the mass of biological objects from the shift of frequency. Sensitivity of the sensor has been calculated when subjected to such biological objects. Molecular structural mechanics approach has been used for investigating the vibrational responses of zigzag and armchair double-walled carbon nanotube-based nano biosensors. The elastic properties of beam element are calculated by considering mechanical characteristics of covalent bonds between the carbon atoms in the hexagonal lattice. Spring elements are used to describe the interlayer interactions between the inner and outer tubes caused due to the van der Waals forces. The mass of each beam element is assumed as point mass at nodes coinciding with carbon atoms at inner and outer wall of DWCNT. Based on the sensitivity and the frequency shift it can be concluded that cantilever zigzag DWCNTs are better candidates for detecting the biological objects.","publish_time":"2014-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Ajay M.; Joshi, Anand Y.","journal":"Appl Nanosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/549844a53c8fa2a371aac15025974deba1034c26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7097327.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13204-014-0364-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bartonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mass of biological objects","carbon atoms","double-walled carbon nanotubes","point mass","shift of frequency","Sensitivity","armchair double-walled carbon nanotube-based nano biosensors","free residue","outer tubes","elastic properties of beam element","amino terminal residue","cantilever zigzag DWCNTs","vibrational responses of zigzag","outer wall of DWCNT","deoxyadenosine","sensing devices","better candidates","alanine","Coronaviridae","mechanical characteristics of covalent bonds","viruses","nodes","van","Bartonella bacilliformis","interlayer interactions","study","Molecular structural mechanics approach","hexagonal lattice","bacteria","Waals forces","Spring elements","expression"],"language":"en"},

Annexin-A1 (AnxA1) is one mediator of endogenous anti-inflammation, affording regulation of leukocyte trafficking and activation in many contexts, yet its role in lung pathologies has been scarcely investigated, despite being highly expressed in lung cells. Here we have applied the bleomycin lung fibrosis model to AnxA1 null mice over a 21-day time-course, to monitor potential impact of this mediator on the control of the inflammatory and fibrotic phases. RESULTS: Analyses in wild-type mice revealed strict spatial and temporal regulation of the Anxa1 gene, e.g. up-regulation in epithelial cells and infiltrated granulocytes at day 7, followed by augmented protein levels in alveolar macrophages by day 21. Absence of AnxA1 caused increases in: i) the degree of inflammation at day 7; and ii) indexes of fibrosis (assessed by deposition of hydroxyproline in the lung) at day 7 and 21. These alterations in AnxA1 null mice were paralleled by augmented TGF-\u03B21, IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1 generation compared to wild-type mice. Finally, treatment of wild type animals with an AnxA1 peptido-mimetic, given prophylactically (from day 0 to 21) or therapeutically (from day 14 onward), ameliorated both signs of inflammation and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Collectively these data reveal a pathophysiological relevance for endogenous AnxA1 in lung inflammation and, more importantly, fibrosis, and may open new insights for the pharmacological treatment of lung fibrosis.","publish_time":"2011-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Damazo, Am\u00EDlcar S; Sampaio, Andr\u00E9 LF; Nakata, Cintia MAG; Flower, Roderick J; Perretti, Mauro; Oliani, Sonia M","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5fe14c66ff48ce3cff7c81201c1800cb725b097.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3212807.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2172-12-59; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22011168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung inflammation","endogenous AnxA1","AnxA1 null mice","Anxa1 gene","Absence of AnxA1","lung cells","pharmacological treatment of lung fibrosis","lung pathologies","wild-type mice","bleomycin lung fibrosis model","AnxA1 peptido-mimetic","indexes of fibrosis","day time-course","degree of inflammation","signs of inflammation","treatment of wild type animals","mediator of endogenous anti-inflammation","temporal regulation","regulation of leukocyte trafficking","epithelial cells","augmented TGF-\u03B21","augmented protein levels","variety of experimental inflammatory settings","anti-inflammatory mediators","IFN-\u03B3","TNF-\u03B1 generation","balancing functions of pro","pathophysiological relevance","control","contexts","alveolar macrophages","infiltrated granulocytes","complex innate responses","new insights","potential impact","data","activation","Analyses","deposition of hydroxyproline","BACKGROUND","fibrotic phases","role","increases","RESULTS","alterations","Annexin-A1","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen is, and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively to disease dynamics. However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health efforts to control infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2018-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pharaon, Joe; Bauch, Chris T.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d9cb8627ae667d02342d17537291907cb65a53e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094168.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29981338/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.06.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519318303102; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519318303102","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virulent strain","resident strain","resident pathogen strain","virulent mutant strain","adaptive social behaviour","perceived severities of pathogen strains","invasion analysis","influence of social behaviour","respective strains","human behaviour","protective behaviour","disease control","perceived severity","Abstract Infectious disease interventions","social processes","mathematical models of competition","differing virulence","infectious diseases","disease dynamics","emergence of virulent pathogens","population","efficacy of infection control","phase plane analysis","time series analysis","compartmental Susceptible-Infectious","higher virulence","prevalence of infection","differing natural history profiles","contact precautions","vaccination","lower basic reproductive number","plausible epidemiological scenarios","differential equation","individuals","public health efforts","certain applications","elimination","results","success","situations","objective","priority"],"language":"en"},

Cellular X-domain associated macrodomain protein/ADP-ribose-1\u2033-monophosphatase (Appr-1\u2033-pase) activities are also reported in coronaviruses (CoV), including identification of its homologs in alpha and rubella viruses. The present study investigated the role(s) of X-domain residues in HEV replication cycle. In silico analysis showed a high degree of evolutionary conservation of X-domain (a.a. 785\u2013942) a.a. positions wherein the N-terminus residues \u2018Asn806, Asn809, His812, Gly815, Gly816, and Gly817\u2019 formed a potential catalytic-site homolog of CoVAppr-1\u2033-pase. To experimentally test this prediction, X-domain \u2018active-site\u2019 residues were subjected to mutational analysis using the HEV-SAR55 replicon (pSK-GFP). FACS analysis of mutant RNA transfected S10-3 cells showed that Gly816Ala and Gly817Ala constructs completely abrogated HEV replication, similar to their Gly816Val and Gly817Val counterparts. However, \u2018Gly815Ala\u2019 mutant replicated very poorly in contrast to \u2018Gly815Val\u2019 that completely abolished GFP synthesis. Furthermore, while \u2018Asn806Ala\u2019 mutant retained RNA replication, the \u2018Asn809Ala\u2019 and His812Leu mutants showed non-viability. Notably, in a sequential-nucleotide mutation analysis, the dispensability of X-domain in HEV replication at transcriptional level has already been demonstrated (Parvez, 2013b). Taken together, the present data strongly argue for an essential role of X-domain residues (Asn809, His812, Gly816 and Gly817) at post-translational level, indicating its involvement in viral replication. In conclusion, the speculated regulatory role of ORF1 X-domain in HEV replication cycle critically depends on the \u2018Asn, Asn, His, Gly, Gly, Gly\u2019 segment/secondary structure. Nevertheless, further biochemical or biophysical characterizations of HEV X-domain associated Appr-1\u2033-pase activity would only confirm its biological significance in virus or host-pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2015-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parvez, Mohammad Khalid","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0898b22b38bdf9962d526c96baa1693f135d16a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127128.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111915004357; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111915004357; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.04.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25870943/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV","FACS","RNA","GFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["X-domain residues","dispensability of X","HEV replication cycle","abrogated HEV replication","biophysical characterizations of HEV X-domain associated Appr","essential role of X","speculated regulatory role of ORF1 X-domain","RNA replication","Cellular X-domain associated macrodomain protein","viral replication","HEV-SAR55 replicon","high degree of evolutionary conservation of X","mutational analysis","silico analysis","N-terminus residues","FACS analysis of mutant RNA transfected S10","pase activity","sequential-nucleotide mutation analysis","ORF1 gene","active-site","transcriptional level","pSK-GFP","present data","present study","post-translational level","hepatitis E virus","abolished GFP synthesis","potential catalytic-site homolog of CoVAppr","cells","Gly817Ala constructs","Gly816Ala","biological significance","ADP-ribose","Asn809Ala","involvement","segment","Gly816Val","non-structural polyprotein","identification","homologs","alpha","His812Leu mutants","Gly815Val","non-viability","host-pathogenesis","secondary structure","coronaviruses","rubella viruses","Gly817Val counterparts","conclusion","positions","Asn806Ala","prediction","Parvez","monophosphatase","activities","contrast","Gly815Ala"],"language":"en"},

An essential step in developing drugs by targeting enzymes is to identify drug-enzyme interactions in cells. It is both time-consuming and costly to do this purely by means of experimental techniques alone. Although some computational methods were developed in this regard based on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of enzyme, unfortunately their usage is quite limited because three-dimensional structures of many enzymes are still unknown. Here, we reported a sequence-based predictor, called \u201CiEzy-Drug,\u201D in which each drug compound was formulated by a molecular fingerprint with 258 feature components, each enzyme by the Chou\u0027s pseudo amino acid composition generated via incorporating sequential evolution information and physicochemical features derived from its sequence, and the prediction engine was operated by the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor algorithm. The overall success rate achieved by iEzy-Drug via rigorous cross-validations was about 91%. Moreover, to maximize the convenience for the majority of experimental scientists, a user-friendly web server was established, by which users can easily obtain their desired results.","publish_time":"2013-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Min, Jian-Liang; Xiao, Xuan; Chou, Kuo-Chen","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/338ea249f053b957f0681c987b83322a96a7350b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3858977.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24371828/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/701317","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chou"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["iEzy-Drug","enzymes","drug-enzyme interactions","drug design","drug compound","three-dimensional structure of enzyme","cells","sequence-based predictor","physicochemical features","three-dimensional structures","experimental techniques","majority of experimental scientists","Chou\u0027s pseudo amino acid composition","sequential evolution information","catalyzing","efficiency","usage","user-friendly web server","molecular fingerprint","feature components","important roles","chemical reactions","organism","high selectivity","developing drugs","frequent targets","knowledge","overall success rate","rigorous cross-validations","essential step","regard","users","nearest neighbor algorithm","life","prediction engine","convenience","computational methods","desired results"],"language":"en"},

Three typical spatial information parameters including working unit/address, onset location and reporting unit were selected and SARS epidemic spread in-out flow in Beijing was defined based on the SARS epidemiological investigation data in China from 2002 to 2003 while its epidemiological characteristics were discussed. Furthermore, by the methods of spatial-temporal statistical analysis and network characteristic analysis, spatial-temporal high-risk hotspots and network structure characteristics of Beijing outer in-out flow were explored, and spatial autocorrelation/heterogeneity, spatial-temporal evolutive rules and structure characteristics of the spread network of Beijing inner in-out flow were comprehensively analyzed. The results show that (1) The outer input flow of SARS epidemic in Beijing concentrated on Shanxi and Guangdong provinces, but the outer output flow was disperse and mainly includes several north provinces such as Guangdong and Shandong. And the control measurement should focus on the early and interim progress of SARS breakout. (2) The inner output cases had significant positive autocorrelative characteristics in the whole studied region, and the high-risk population was young and middle-aged people with ages from 20 to 60 and occupations of medicine and civilian labourer. (3) The downtown districts were main high-risk hotspots of SARS epidemic in Beijing, the northwest suburban districts/counties were secondary high-risk hotspots, and northeast suburban areas were relatively safe. (4) The district/county nodes in inner spread network showed small-world characteristics and information/material flow had notable heterogeneity. The suburban Tongzhou and Changping districts were the underlying high-risk regions, and several suburban districts such as Shunyi and Huairou were the relatively low-risk safe regions as they carried out minority information/material flow. The exploration and analysis based on epidemic spread in-out flow help better detect and discover the potential spatial-temporal evolutive rules and characteristics of SARS epidemic, and provide a more effective theoretical basis for emergency/control measurements and decision-making.","publish_time":"2012-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, BiSong; Gong, JianHua; Zhou, JiePing; Sun, Jun; Yang, LiYang; Xia, Yu; Ibrahim, Abdoul Nasser","journal":"Sci China Earth Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ac95b89c54a4e0cc48f2f8f2dca78e69217af43.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-012-4479-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288762/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Shunyi"],"locations":["China","Shanxi","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["characteristics of SARS epidemic","SARS epidemic spread","epidemic spread network","spatial regions","material flow","hotspots of SARS epidemic","outer input flow of SARS epidemic","characteristics of information","spatial-temporal high-risk hotspots","epidemic progress","outer output flow","spread network of Beijing inner","inner spread network","spatial autocorrelation","epidemiological characteristics","methods of spatial","network structure characteristics of Beijing outer","potential spatial-temporal evolutive rules","epidemic spread mechanism of virus input","typical spatial information parameters","underlying high-risk regions","network characteristic analysis","temporal statistical analysis","small-world characteristics","northwest suburban districts","spatial-temporal change mode of individual susceptible-infected","significant positive autocorrelative characteristics","minority information","Changping districts","suburban Tongzhou","downtown districts","interim progress of SARS breakout","SARS epidemiological investigation data","inner output cases","northeast suburban areas","low-risk safe regions","Guangdong provinces","working unit","reporting unit","control measurements","notable heterogeneity","north provinces","address","emergency","onset location","county nodes","effective theoretical basis","Huairou","counties","Shanxi","studied region","population","China","Shunyi","occupations of medicine","civilian labourer","ages","people","decision-making","Shandong","individuals","exploration","results"],"language":"en"},

Coronavirus surveillance studies in different populations of bats have suggested that they are probable reservoirs for this novel virus, and phylogenetic analysis of both the spike (S1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins of MERS-CoV have revealed that it is related to bat viruses. Recently, the MERS-CoV and its neutralizing antibodies were detected in dromedary camels.

The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. METHODS: A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. RESULTS: A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Bo; Yang, Jing; Zhao, Faming; Zhi, Lili; Wang, Xiqian; Liu, Lin; Bi, Zhaohui; Zhao, Yunhe","journal":"Clin Res Cardiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8c25a8f628c12291a84d4cd60a0e09826778116.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087935.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161990/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-020-01626-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe patients","non-ICU","severe cases","severe condition","severe counterparts","development of COVID","cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities","prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases","previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases","association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases","cardia-cerebrovascular diseases","relevant studies","meta-analysis of eligible studies","diabetes","twofolds","incidences of hypertension","incidence of acute cardiac injury","proportions of hypertension","nCoV","greater risk","novel corona virus","threefolds","CONCLUSION","METHODS","PubMed","total","damage","Embase","RESULTS","turn","BACKGROUND","prognosis","heart","aim","hand","infection"],"language":"en"},

Re-purposing the available protease inhibitor drugs for immediate use in treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infections could improve the currently available clinical management. The current study, aims to predict theoretical structure for protease of COVID-19 and to explore further whether this protein can serve as a target for protease inhibitor drugs such as remdesivir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir and \u03B1-ketoamide. While the 3D structure of protease was predicted using SWISS MODEL server, molecular interaction studies between protein and ligands were performed using AutoDock software. The predicted protease model was reasonably good based on reports generated by different validation servers. The study further revealed that all the protease inhibitor drugs got docked with negative dock energy onto the target protein. Molecular interaction studies showed that protease structure had multiple active site residues for remdesivir, while for remaining ligands the structure had only one active site residue each. From the output of multiple sequence alignment, it is evident that ligand binding sites were conserved. The current in silico study thus, provides structural insights about the protease of COVID-19 and also its molecular interactions with some of the known protease inhibitors.

The discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV shows that HCoVs pose a significant threat to human health. Our work aims to develop a sensitive method (mCoV-MS) which can not only identify known HCoVs accurately, but also have the ability to provide clues for the emerging HCoVs. The method was performed using a MassARRAY matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system. We developed a 17-plex analysis to detect six HCoVs in Panel A and another 17-plex analysis to detect Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus in Panel B. All tested primers and probes for the mCoV-MS method were effective, with no cross-reactivity observed with other common respiratory viruses. To confirm the usefulness of the mCoV-MS method we screened 384 pharyngeal and/or anal swab samples collected from bats/rodents, and 131 nasal and throat swabs from human patients. The results showed good concordance with the results of metagenomic analysis or PCR-sequencing. The validation test showed mCoV-MS method can detect potentially pathogenic CoVs in Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus and provide convincingly phylogenetic evidences about unknown CoVs. The mCoV-MS method is a sensitive assay that is relatively simple to carry out. We propose that this method be used to complement next generation sequencing technology for large-scale screening studies.","publish_time":"2017-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiu, Leshan; Zhang, Chi; Wu, Zhiqiang; Peng, Junping","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0494e196f7f6d783c5c05ac339d19934c000c1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5552709.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28848521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["mCoV-MS method","sensitive method","emerging HCoVs","known HCoVs","MALDI-TOF MS","plex analysis","Betacoronavirus","Middle East respiratory syndrome","results of metagenomic analysis","common respiratory viruses","Alphacoronavirus","Panel","range of respiratory symptoms","human patients","human health","human coronaviruses","discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome","pathogenic CoVs","sensitive assay","PCR-sequencing","unknown CoVs","generation sequencing technology","SARS","flight mass spectrometry","ionization time","probes","bats","rodents","laser desorption","large-scale screening studies","tested primers","anal swab samples","throat swabs","cross-reactivity","MassARRAY matrix","phylogenetic evidences","good concordance","significant threat","validation test","clues","system","usefulness","ability","work"],"language":"en"},

However, diagnostic criteria for AB are heterogeneous and not very well known. OBJECTIVE: To identify the diagnostic criteria for AB used by experts and clinical paediatricians in Spain. METHODS: Delphi study with Spanish AB experts, looking for the points of agreement about AB diagnosis. A subsequent cross-sectional study was conducted by means of an on-line questionnaire addressed to all Spanish paediatricians, reached through electronic mail messages sent by nine paediatric scientific societies. Descriptive and factorial analyses were carried out, looking for any association of diagnostic criteria with demographic or geographic variables, or with paediatric subspecialty. RESULTS: Agreement was reached by 40 experts in many issues (first episode of respiratory distress and high respiratory frequency, diagnosis in any season of the year, and usefulness of virus identification in making diagnosis), but opposite views were maintained on key characteristics such as the maximum age for diagnosis. The on-line questionnaire was completed by 1297 paediatricians. Their diagnostic criteria were heterogeneous and strongly associated with their paediatric sub-specialty. Their agreement with the Spanish expert consensus and with international standards was very poor. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic criteria for AB in Spain are heterogeneous. These differences could cause variability in clinical practice with AB patients.","publish_time":"2018-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cano-Garcinu\u00F1o, Alfredo; Praena-Crespo, Manuel; Mora-Gandarillas, Isabel; Carvajal-Urue\u00F1a, Ignacio; Call\u00E9n-Blecua, Mar\u00EDa Teresa; Garc\u00EDa-Merino, \u00C1gueda","journal":"An Pediatr (Barc)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105059.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172561/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2018.07.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Delphi"],"organizations":["AB"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["AB diagnosis","Spanish AB experts","AB patients","association of diagnostic criteria","Spanish paediatricians","clinical paediatricians","paediatric subspecialty","Spain","points of agreement","on-line questionnaire","episode of respiratory distress","high respiratory frequency","Spanish expert consensus","common respiratory diseases","paediatric scientific societies","paediatric sub-specialty","clinical practice","Delphi study","subsequent cross-sectional study","geographic variables","electronic mail messages","key characteristics","international standards","year","variability","season","usefulness of virus identification","opposite views","maximum age","INTRODUCTION","Acute viral bronchiolitis","issues","METHODS","differences","infants","CONCLUSIONS","factorial analyses","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"}]}

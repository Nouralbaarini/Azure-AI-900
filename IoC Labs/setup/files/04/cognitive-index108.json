Patients \u003E 1500 g treated on an intermediate care unit are unrepresented in recent literature. We therefore intended to present data obtained from a short-term overcrowded neonatal intermediate care unit (NIMCU) at a level III (international categorization) perinatal center at University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany. METHODS: During a 25 day overcrowding (OV) and 28 day post-overcrowding period (POST-OV) on NIMCU, epidemiological data obtained from continuously hold microbiological surveillance were investigated and compared to the last 12 months of ward-regular bed occupancy preceding OV (PRAE-OV). RESULTS: During OV, the number of patients simultaneously treated at the NIMCU increased from 18 to 22, resulting in a reduced bed-to-bed space. Nurse: patient ratio was 4:22 during OV compared to 3:18 during PRAE-OV. Cumulative incidence of MDRGN was 4.7% in OV and 2.4% POST-OV compared to 4.8% to PRAE-OV, respectively, without any significant variations. During OV and POST-OV, septic episodes due to MDRGN were not observed. In one case, potential nosocomial transmission of Enterobacter cloacae resistant to Piperacillin and 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of nosocomial spread of MDRGN in an overcrowded NIMCU is based on staff\u2019s diligent training and adequate staffing. Concise microbiological surveillance should be guaranteed to escort through overcrowding periods. In our setting, impact of bed-to-bed distance on MDRGN transmission seemed to be less strong.","publish_time":"2019-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fischer, Doris; Schl\u00F6\u00DFer, Rolf L.; Kempf, Volkhard A.

Innate immunity plays significant roles in host defense against IBV. Here, we explored the interaction between IBV and the host innate immune system. Severe histopathological lesions were observed in the tracheal mucosa at 3-5 days post inoculation (dpi) and in the kidney at 8 dpi, with heavy viral loads at 1-11 and 1-28 dpi, respectively. The expression of mRNAs encoding Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and TLR7 were upregulated at 3-8 dpi, and that of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon (IFN) \u03B2 (TRIF) was upregulated at 21 dpi in the trachea and kidney. Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) was upregulated in the trachea during early infection. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 3 and TRAF6 were upregulated expression in both tissues. Moreover, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), stimulator of IFN genes (STING), and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), as well as TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK) \u03B5, IKK\u03B1, IKK\u03B2, IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7, nuclear factor of kappaB (NF-\u0138B), IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, various interleukins(ILs), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03B2 (MIP-1\u03B2) were significantly upregulated in the trachea and downregulated in the kidney. These results suggested that the TLR and MDA5 signaling pathways and innate immune cytokine were induced after IBV infection. Additionally, consistent responses to IBV infection were observed during early infection, with differential and complicated responses in the kidney.

A prospective cohort study with data collection at three phases (before, during and after Hajj) was conducted among Australian pilgrims between August and December 2015. Baseline data were collected from 421 pilgrims before Hajj, with 391 providing follow-up data during Hajj and 300 after their home return. Most participants (78% [329/421]) received one or more recommended vaccines; travel agents\u0027 advice was the main factor affecting vaccination uptake. Most participants (69% [270/391]) practiced hand hygiene with soap and sanitizers frequently, followed by disposable handkerchief use (36% [139/391]) and washing hands with water only (28% [111/391]). During Hajj 74% (288/391) of participants reported one or more illness symptoms, 86% (248/288) of these symptoms were respiratory. Cough was less often reported among pilgrims who received vaccinations, cleaned their hands with soap or alcoholic hand rubs, while a runny nose was less common among those who frequently washed their hands with plain water but was more common among those who used facemasks.

In the present study, an aptamer directed against the reverse transcriptase was analyzed for its potential to attain a temperature-dependent reverse transcriptase (\u201Chot start\u201D RT). FINDINGS: The hot start effect was investigated in a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Results with aptamer revealed a reduced RT activity at low temperatures while achieving full activity at the specific annealing temperature of 55 \u00B0C.

The objective of this study is to carry out a rigorous mathematical analysis of a communicable disease transmission model with quarantine (of latent cases) and isolation (of symptomatic cases), in which the waiting periods in the infected classes are assumed to have gamma distributions. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that it has a globally-asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever its associated reproduction number is less than unity. The model has a unique endemic equilibrium when the threshold quantity exceeds unity. The endemic equilibrium is shown to be locally and globally-asymptotically stable for special cases. Numerical simulations, using data related to the 2003 SARS outbreaks, show that the cumulative number of disease-related mortality increases with increasing number of disease stages. Furthermore, the cumulative number of new cases is higher if the asymptomatic period is distributed such that most of the period is spent in the early stages of the asymptomatic compartments in comparison to the cases where the average time period is equally distributed among the associated stages or if most of the time period is spent in the later (final) stages of the asymptomatic compartments. Finally, it is shown that distributing the average sojourn time in the infectious (asymptomatic) classes equally or unequally does not effect the cumulative number of new cases.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Safi, Mohammad A.; Gumel, Abba B.","journal":"Applied Mathematics and Computation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b56d89c897e5a628dee42e58d9121832e9371ff2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112307.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009630031100926X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2011.07.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009630031100926X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287495/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cumulative number of disease","latent cases","cumulative number of new cases","asymptomatic period","increasing number of disease stages","symptomatic cases","special cases","associated stages","associated reproduction number","asymptomatic compartments","average time period","communicable disease transmission model","early stages","disease transmission models","infectious periods","comparison","associated epidemiological data","use of gamma distribution assumption","unique endemic equilibrium","stable disease-free equilibrium","Rigorous analysis","average sojourn time","unity","use of exponential distribution assumption","rigorous mathematical analysis","waiting periods","related mortality","infected classes","gamma distributions","quarantine","better fit","threshold quantity","isolation","SARS outbreaks","Abstract Recent studies","study","Numerical simulations","objective"],"language":"en"},

Although they generally behave as transient or permanent commensals, they can occasionally cause life-threatening pneumonia (Pneumocystis pneumonia; PCP) in immunosuppressed individuals. Several decades ago, the presence of Pneumocystis morphotypes (trophic forms and cysts) was described in the lungs of normal cats and cats with experimentally induced symptomatic PCP (after immunosuppression by corticosteroids); yet to date spontaneous or drug-induced PCP has not been described in the clinical feline literature, despite immunosuppression of cats by long-standing retrovirus infections or after kidney transplantation. In this study, we describe the presence of Pneumocystis DNA in the lungs of normal cats (that died of various unrelated causes; n = 84) using polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeting the mitochondrial small and large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (mtSSU rRNA and mtLSU rRNA). The presence of Pneumocystis DNA was confirmed by sequencing in 24/84 (29%) cats, with evidence of two different sequence types (or lineages). Phylogenetically, lineage1 (L1; 19 cats) and lineage 2 (L2; 5 cats) formed separate clades, clustering with Pneumocystis from domestic pigs (L1) and carnivores (L2), respectively. Results of the present study support the notion that cats can be colonized or subclinically infected by Pneumocystis, without histological evidence of damage to the pulmonary parenchyma referable to pneumocystosis. Pneumocystis seems most likely an innocuous pathogen of cats\u2019 lungs, but its possible role in the exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders or viral/bacterial coinfections should be considered further in a clinical setting.","publish_time":"2018-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Danesi, Patrizia; Corr\u00F2, Michela; Falcaro, Christian; Carminato, Antonio; Furlanello, Tommaso; Cocchi, Monia; Krockenberger, Mark B; Meyer, Wieland; Capelli, Gioia; Malik, Richard","journal":"Med Mycol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1268185b8c38c7f185cb22e180c1e3e061daa3dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566653/; https://doi.org/10.1093/mmy/myy139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunosuppression of cats","Pneumocystis pneumonia","lungs of normal cats","genus Pneumocystis","presence of Pneumocystis DNA","presence of Pneumocystis morphotypes","symptomatic PCP","L1","drug-induced PCP","L2","innocuous pathogen of cats\u2019 lungs","mtSSU rRNA","mtLSU rRNA","life-threatening pneumonia","present study","clinical setting","pulmonary parenchyma referable","histological evidence of damage","clinical feline literature","exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders","large subunit ribosomal RNA gene","long-standing retrovirus infections","clustering","possible role","domestic pigs","PCRs","trophic forms","cysts","separate clades","bacterial coinfections","different sequence types","polymerase chain reactions","kidney transplantation","various unrelated causes","carnivores","corticosteroids","potential pathogens","immunosuppressed individuals","lineages","pneumocystosis","wide range of mammals","notion","permanent commensals","Results","lineage1","sequencing","decades"],"language":"en"},

Fifteen respiratory viruses were included in our investigation: respiratory syncytial virus A/B (RSV), influenza virus A (FluA) and influenza virus B (FluB), human metapneumovirus (MPV), enterovirus (EV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1\u20134, human rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E, human adenovirus (ADV), and human bocavirus (Boca). In total, 474 specimens were collected and tested. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently by PCR (357, 75.3%) than they were by traditional tests (229, 49.3%). The leading pathogens were RSV (113, 23.8%), RV (72, 15.2%), PIV3 (53, 11.2%), FluA (51, 10.8%), and ADV (48, 10.1%). For children younger than 5 years, RSV and RV were most prevalent; for children older than 5 years, FluA and ADV were the most frequently detected. Of the specimens, 25.8% (92/357) were coinfected with two or more viruses. RV, Boca, PIV2, FluB, and PIV4 had higher rates of coinfection; MPV and PIV1 had the lowest rates of coinfection (9.1% and 5.3%). To conclude, the detection power of PCR was better than that of traditional antigen tests and virus cultures when considering the detection of respiratory viruses. RSV and RV were the leading viral pathogens identified in the respiratory specimens. One-quarter of the positive specimens were coinfected with two or more viruses. In the future, further application of PCR may contribute to the rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses and could improve patient outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Chien-Yu; Hwang, David; Chiu, Nan-Chang; Weng, Li-Chuan; Liu, Hsin-Fu; Mu, Jung-Jung; Liu, Chang-Pan; Chi, Hsin","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd4ab143e7dd8db7255b11177505986e87b50943.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7013517.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31952364/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17020564","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid","ADV","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of respiratory viruses","respiratory specimens","accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","RV","accurate detection of viruses","human parainfluenza virus","virus cultures","RSV","human metapneumovirus","human rhinovirus","human adenovirus","human bocavirus","detection rates","influenza virus B","traditional tests","detection power of PCR","FluA","human coronavirus OC43","traditional antigen tests","application of PCR","positive specimens","common cause of respiratory tract infection","leading viral pathogens","accurate diagnosis of viral infections","FluB","MPV","viral etiology","higher rates of coinfection","lowest rates of coinfection","years","leading pathogens","children older","children younger","clinical outcomes","patient outcomes","enterovirus","PIV1","types","multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction","RTI","PIV4","NL63","pediatric patients","EV","investigation","use of antibiotics","diagnostic technology","PIV2","treatment sessions","Advances","neonates","quarter","future","PIV3","total"],"language":"en"},

Besides providing early warning to natural hazards, animals can also provide early warning to societal hazards like bioterrorism. Animals are ideal surveillance tools to humans because they share the same environment as humans and spend more time outdoors than humans, increasing their exposure risk. Furthermore, the biologically compressed lifespans of some animals may allow them to develop clinical signs more rapidly after exposure to specific pathogens. Animals are an excellent channel for monitoring novel and known pathogens with outbreak potential given that more than 60 % of emerging infectious diseases in humans originate as zoonoses. This review attempts to highlight animal illnesses, deaths, biomarkers or sentinel events, to remind human and veterinary public health programs that animal health can be used to discover, monitor or predict environmental health hazards, human health hazards, or bioterrorism. Lastly, we hope that this review will encourage the implementation of animals as a surveillance tool by clinicians, veterinarians, ecosystem health professionals, researchers and governments.","publish_time":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neo, Jacqueline Pei Shan; Tan, Boon Huan","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09477f05e3ba6df6b75f3b2c2633e5206db39abd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130562.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517302134; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517302134; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28619165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human health hazards","environmental health hazards","animal health","humans","domestic animals","implementation of animals","societal hazards","natural hazards","ecosystem health professionals","veterinary public health programs","ideal surveillance tools","early warning","bioterrorism","review attempts","monitoring novel","animal illnesses","known pathogens","specific pathogens","exposure risk","veterinarians","clinicians","deaths","excellent channel","biomarkers","sentinel events","researchers","utilization of wild","outbreak potential","governments","emerging infectious diseases","zoonoses","clinical signs","time","compressed lifespans"],"language":"en"},

G4s have been extensively described in the human genome, especially in telomeres and oncogene promoters; in recent years the presence of G4s in viruses has attracted increasing interest. Indeed, G4s have been reported in several viruses, including those involved in recent epidemics, such as the Zika and Ebola viruses. Viral G4s are usually located in regulatory regions of the genome and implicated in the control of key viral processes; in some cases, they have been involved also in viral latency. In this context, G4 ligands have been developed and tested both as tools to study the complexity of G4-mediated mechanisms in the viral life cycle, and as therapeutic agents. In general, G4 ligands showed promising antiviral activity, with G4-mediated mechanisms of action both at the genome and transcript level. This review aims to provide an updated close-up of the literature on G4s in viruses. The current state of the art of G4 ligands in antiviral research is also reported, with particular focus on the structural and physicochemical requirements for optimal biological activity. The achievements and the to-dos in the field are discussed.","publish_time":"2018-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruggiero, Emanuela; Richter, Sara N","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81b992164d368b01c45fa3cc4ffd54d525e1d4b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5909458.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554280/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky187","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral G4s","presence of G4s","complexity of G4","art of G4 ligands","G4-mediated mechanisms of action","viral latency","Ebola viruses","viral life cycle","regulatory regions","human genome","control of key viral processes","promising antiviral activity","antiviral research","recent years","recent epidemics","optimal biological activity","guanine-rich strands of regulatory genomic regions","non-canonical nucleic acids secondary structures","physicochemical requirements","oncogene promoters","telomeres","particular focus","updated close-up","Zika","literature","therapeutic agents","current state","cases","G-quadruplexes","transcript level","achievements","to-dos","field","review","tools","context"],"language":"en"},

In routine diagnostic procedures, infection is determined by microscopy, which is not sufficient to differentiate these species. We investigated whether routine Cryptosporidium diagnostic procedures need improvement to include species determination. The relation of Cryptosporidium spp. and subtype with the clinical picture and other pathogens was also investigated. A total of 782 diarrhoeal calf samples were analysed and Cryptosporidium infection was diagnosed in 198 samples. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in 178, C. bovis in six and mixed C. bovis/C. parvum in seven samples. Twenty-seven C. parvum subtypes were identified, of which 16 were newly described. Except for three herds, only one subtype per herd was identified. Cryptosporidium parvum-positive calves were younger than C. bovis-positive calves and most C. parvum infections were seen at 1\u20133weeks of age. Oocyst counts were higher in C. parvum samples. Yellow faecal colour was associated with C. parvum infection. Watery faeces had no greater association with C. parvum infection, but C. parvum subtype family IIa was more common than subtype family IId in watery faecal samples. No other pathogens were detected in the six C. bovis-infected calves, indicating a pathogenic potential. Our results show that species determination does not need to be included in routine Cryptosporidium diagnostic procedures in order to estimate the clinical relevance of infection in diarrhoeal calves. The maximum age when analysis for clinical cryptosporidiosis is performed can be lowered to 6weeks of age. However, the indicated pathogenic potential of C. bovis warrants further attention.","publish_time":"2013-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silverl\u00E5s, C.; Bosaeus-Reineck, H.; N\u00E4slund, K.; Bj\u00F6rkman, C.","journal":"International Journal for Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e21aa997c9ea0041a570747a78615f6d2509b26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094644.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020751912002548; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751912002548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23142404/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.10.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["parvum samples","Cryptosporidium infection","Abstract Cryptosporidium parvum","Cryptosporidium parvum-positive calves","parvum infections","parvum subtypes","Sweden Cryptosporidium bovis","relation of Cryptosporidium","diarrhoeal samples","bovis-positive calves","parvum subtype family IIa","routine Cryptosporidium diagnostic procedures","bovis-infected calves","diarrhoeal calves","common species","watery faecal samples","diarrhoeal calf samples","preweaned calves","clinical relevance of infection","routine diagnostic procedures","species determination","weeks of age","maximum age","age group","subtype family IId","common pathogen","clinical cryptosporidiosis","clinical picture","pathogens","indicated pathogenic potential of","Watery faeces","Yellow faecal colour","order","improvement","greater association","analysis","apathogenic","Oocyst counts","microscopy","total","herds","results","attention","cause of diarrhoea"],"language":"en"},

The most important failure in pandemic planning is the lack of standards or guidelines regarding what it means to be \u2018prepared\u2019. The aim of this study was to assess the preparedness of acute hospitals in the Republic of Ireland for an influenza pandemic from an infection control perspective. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study involving a questionnaire completed by infection control nurses, time period from June \u2013 July 2013, (3 weeks) from acute public and private hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. A total of 46 out of 56 hospitals responded to the questionnaire. RESULTS: From a sample of 46 Irish hospitals, it was found that Irish hospitals are not fully prepared for an influenza pandemic despite the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. In 2013, thirty five per cent of Irish hospitals have participated in an emergency plan or infectious disease exercise and have plans or been involved in local planning efforts to care for patients at non-health care facilities. Sixty per cent of Irish hospitals did not compile or did not know if the hospital had compiled a \u201Clessons learned\u201D from any exercise that were then used to revise emergency response plans. Fifty two per cent of hospitals have sufficient airborne isolation capacity to address routine needs and have an interim emergency plan to address needs during an outbreak. Fifty one percent of hospitals have taken specific measures to stockpile or have reserve medical supplies e.g. masks, ventilators and linen. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study carried out in the Republic of Ireland investigating the current preparedness for an influenza pandemic from an infection control perspective. Deficits exist in the provision of emergency planning committees, testing of emergency plans, airborne isolation facilities, stockpiling of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical supplies and organisational schemes/incentives for healthcare workers to continue to work in a pandemic. While Irish standards are comparable to findings from international studies, the health care service needs to continue to enhance preparedness for an influenza pandemic and implement standard preparedness guidance for all Irish hospitals.","publish_time":"2015-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reidy, Mary; Ryan, Fiona; Hogan, Dervla; Lacey, Sean; Buckley, Claire","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4b02808f112f00b4271fcd1eabdba3b7edcc1a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4557843.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-2025-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26335570/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Republic of Ireland"],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","cent of Irish hospitals","pandemic planning","private hospitals","percent of hospitals","preparedness of acute hospitals","Irish standards","testing of emergency plans","emergency response plans","Republic of Ireland","interim emergency plan","infection control perspective","provision of emergency planning committees","current preparedness","infection control nurses","health care service needs","airborne isolation facilities","medical supplies","standard preparedness guidance","non-health care facilities","questionnaire","local planning efforts","cross sectional study","sufficient airborne isolation capacity","lack of standards","acute public","infectious disease exercise","international studies","patients","organisational schemes","incentives","PPE","personal protective equipment","routine","findings","population","attack rates","healthcare workers","masks","ventilators","time period","specific measures","important failure","linen","weeks","sample","METHODS","lessons","guidelines","Deficits","outbreak","H1N1","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","aim","CONCLUSIONS","total"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of the S1 gene sequences amplified from the 62 isolated strains together with 40 reference strains published in Genbank showed nucleotide homologies ranging from 63.5 to 99.9 % and amino acid homologies ranging from 57.9 to 100 %. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Chinese IBV strains were clustered into six distinct genetic groups (I\u2013VI). Most of the isolated strains belonged to group I, and the isolation of group V strains was increased compared with an earlier period of surveillance. Current vaccine strains used in China (H120, H52, W93, and Ma5) formed the group Mass which is evolutionarily distant from Chinese isolates. Alignment of S1 amino acid sequences revealed polymorphic and diverse substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and the S1 protein of major pandemic strains contained 540 amino acids with a cleavage site sequence of HRRRR or RRF(L/S)RR. Further analysis showed that recombination events formed a new subgroup. Taken together, these findings suggest that various IBV variants were co-circulating and undergoing genetic evolution in southern China during the observation period. Therefore, long-term continuing surveillance is significantly important for prevention and control of IBV infection.","publish_time":"2014-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Keyu; Xue, Yu; Wang, Feng; Chen, Feng; Shu, Dingming; Xie, Qingmei","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088760.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000989/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-014-1097-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["isolated strains","Chinese IBV strains","reference strains","Current vaccine strains","isolation of group V strains","S1 protein of major pandemic strains","strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus","southern China","amino acid homologies","Alignment of S1 amino acid sequences","amino acids","various IBV variants","S1 gene sequences","control of IBV infection","group Mass","Phylogenetic analysis","earlier period of surveillance","genetic evolution","Chinese isolates","observation period","nucleotide homologies","distinct genetic groups","long-term continuing surveillance","diverse substitutions","co-circulating","RRF","prevention","cleavage site sequence of HRRRR","diseased chickens","deletions","different farms","H120","insertions","recombination events","Ma5","H52","W93","Genbank","new subgroup","findings","typical nephritis"],"language":"en"},

Two hundred ninety E. coli isolates were recovered from 300 rectal swabs of diarrheic lambs and were confirmed by biochemical tests. The pathotype determination was done according to the presence of genes including f5, f41, LTI, STI, bfp, ipaH, stx (1), stx (2), eae, ehlyA, cnf (1), cnf (2), cdIII, cdIV, and f17 by PCR method. Sixty-six isolates (23.72%) possessed the STI gene and categorized into entrotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Nine isolates (3.1%) and five isolates (1.72%) were positive for the cnf1 and cnf2 genes which categorized into necrotoxic E. coli (NTEC). Hundred and seventeen isolates (40.34%) harbored stx (1) and/or stx (2) and classified as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Thirteen isolates (4.48%) were assigned to atypical entropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC) and possessed eae gene. Two isolates (0.68%) were positive for ipaH gene and were assigned to entroinvasive E. coli (EIEC). Statistical analysis showed a specific association between eae gene and STEC pathotype (P \u003C 0.0001). The most prevalent resistance was observed against lincomycin (96.5%) and the lowest resistance was against kanamycine (56.02%), respectively. The high prevalence of STEC and ETEC indicates that diarrheic lambs represent an important reservoir for humans. ETEC may play an important role for frequent occurrence of diarrhea in lambs observed in this region. Due to high antibiotic resistance, appropriate control should be implemented in veterinary medicine to curb the development of novel resistant isolates.","publish_time":"2017-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghanbarpour, Reza; Askari, Nasrin; Ghorbanpour, Masoud; Tahamtan, Yahya; Mashayekhi, Khoobyar; Afsharipour, Narjes; Darijani, Nasim","journal":"Trop Anim Health Prod","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44515028fe76240b7fa70e89d5c48da9efe33fc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089295.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28161846/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-017-1234-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["STI","STEC","ETEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coli isolates","stx","eae gene","STI gene","ipaH gene","ETEC","development of novel resistant isolates","diseased lambs","STEC pathotype","antimicrobial profile of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli","analysis of virulence genes","presence of genes","cnf2 genes","rectal swabs of diarrheic lambs","high prevalence of STEC","high antibiotic resistance","prevalent resistance","lowest resistance","important role","Statistical analysis","important reservoir","pathotype determination","specific association","f41","LTI","appropriate control","frequent occurrence of diarrhea","f5","bfp","aEPEC","cdIV","f17","veterinary medicine","necrotoxic","entroinvasive","entrotoxigenic","PCR method","present study","cdIII","atypical entropathogenic","cnf1","humans","biochemical tests","Shiga toxin","aim","lincomycin","kanamycine","region","NTEC","EIEC","ehlyA"],"language":"en"},

Although the majority of MERS-CoV cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, the overall risk in areas outside the Middle East remains significant as inside Saudi Arabia. Additional pandemics of MERS-CoV are expected, and thus novel tools and reagents for therapy and diagnosis are urgently needed. Here, we used phage display to develop novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target MERS-CoV. A human Fab phage display library was panned against the S2 subunit of the MERS-CoV spike protein (MERS-S2P), yielding three unique Fabs (S2A3, S2A6, and S2D5). The Fabs had moderate apparent affinities (Half maximal effective concentration (EC(50) = 123\u2013421 nM) for MERS-S2P, showed no cross-reactivity to spike proteins from other CoVs, and were non-aggregating and thermostable (T(m) = 61.5\u201380.4 \u00B0C). Reformatting the Fabs into IgGs (Immunoglobulin Gs) greatly increased their apparent affinities (K(D) = 0.17\u20131.2 nM), presumably due to the effects of avidity. These apparent affinities were notably higher than that of a previously reported anti-MERS-CoV S2 reference mAb (K(D) = 8.7 nM). Furthermore, two of the three mAbs (S2A3 and S2D5) bound only MERS-CoV (Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)) and not other CoVs, reflecting their high binding specificity. However, the mAbs lacked MERS-CoV neutralizing activity. Given their high affinity, specificity, and desirable stabilities, we anticipate that these anti-MERS-CoV mAbs would be suitable reagents for developing antibody-based diagnostics in laboratory or hospital settings for point-of-care testing.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yoonji; Lee, Hansaem; Park, Keunwan; Park, Sora; Lim, Ju-Hyeon; So, Min Kyung; Woo, Hye-Min; Ko, Hyemin; Lee, Jeong-Min; Lim, Sun Hee; Ko, Byoung Joon; Park, Yeon-Su; Choi, So-Young; Song, Du Hyun; Lee, Joo-Yeon; Kim, Sung Soon; Kim, Dae Young","journal":"Antibodies (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b4ac4cf566b08058a36a9ed00b7fb66f1623ae3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6783954.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544848/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antib8030042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","Erasmus Medical Center"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-S2P","anti-MERS-CoV mAbs","majority of MERS","MERS-CoV spike protein","CoV cases","anti-MERS-CoV S2 reference mAb","Additional pandemics of MERS","nM","moderate apparent affinities","Saudi Arabia","high morbidity","CoVs","high affinity","high binding specificity","unique Fabs","S2A3","S2D5","Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","suitable reagents","S2 subunit","novel tools","human Fab phage display library","novel monoclonal antibodies","Half maximal effective concentration","laboratory","antibody-based diagnostics","areas","hospital settings","overall risk","point","EMC","Erasmus Medical Center","mortality of individuals","therapy","desirable stabilities","cross-reactivity","S2A6","global concern","Immunoglobulin Gs","proteins","diagnosis","care testing","report","effects of avidity"],"language":"en"},

Addition of oligosaccharides to F protein during synthesis was completely partially resistant to TM resulting in an 80-kDa form designated GTM.

Furthermore, treatment of detergent-extracted G protein with endoglycosidase F and endo-\u03B1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, enzymes that specifically cleave N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, respectively, generated a variety of partially unglycosylated species, ranging in molecular weight from approximately 80 to 40 kDa. Virus infectivity was sensitive to limited removal of N-linked or O-linked oligosaccharides by endoglycosidases under conditions which did not greatly alter the molecular weight of the G protein.

We have therefore evaluated the immunogenicity of E3L in healthy VV vaccinated donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers (n=13) who had previously received a smallpox vaccine (Dryvax\u00AE) were activated and expanded using overlapping E3L peptides and their function, specificity and anti-viral activity was analyzed. E3L-specific T-cells were expanded from 7 of 12 (58.3%) vaccinated healthy donors. 25% of these produced CD8\u002B T-cell responses and 87.5% produced CD4\u002B T-cells.

In this study, more than 150 samples collected from dogs showing respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological signs suggesting canine distemper virus (CDV) infection were examined. The samples consisted of urine, blood and nasal swabs collected from clinically ill patients, sent to our laboratory by clinicians from various veterinary clinics throughout Hungary. Various organs collected during the necropsy of dogs with pathological changes that suggested CDV infection were also included. Three distinct PCRs were designed. For diagnostic purposes, a primer pair specific to a 409 bases-long segment within the conservative part of the large polymerase region (L) of the CDV genome was designed. Using this test, out of the 150 analyzed samples, 46 (30.66%) proved to be positive for CDV, indicating that CDV still represents a high risk to the canine population in Hungary. For the phylogenetical analysis, a primer pair that completely encompasses the hemagglutinin (H) gene of the CDV genome was designed. The amplicons of this region were sequenced in both directions using the appropriate primers. Our results indicate that several different CDV genotypes are currently present in Hungary. Nine of the analyzed Hungarian strains turned out to belong to the so-called Arctic group of CDVs, and were most closely related to non-European strains from North America, China and Greenland, as well as to the phocine distemper virus 2 (PDV-2) isolated from Baikal seals (Phoca sibirica). One of the Hungarian strains showed high similarity to other European isolates from Denmark, Germany, Italy and Turkey, as well as to other isolates from geographically more distant regions, such as the USA. Three Hungarian strains seem to join a new cluster that is formed by only a couple of strains, one isolated from a mink in Denmark, and another from a dog in North America. Using a third set of primers, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay has also been designed for the fast and reliable differentiation of the wild-type CDVs from the vaccine strains.","publish_time":"2007-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Demeter, Zolt\u00E1n; Lakatos, B\u00E9la; Palade, Elena Alina; Kozma, Tam\u00E1s; Forg\u00E1ch, Petra; Rusvai, Mikl\u00F3s","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fb22e2c12483b770f516c8cae9ae37fbbba6a8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117499.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113507000685; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113507000685","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV"],"locations":["China","Greenland","Denmark","Germany","Hungary","North America"],"keyphrases":["CDV infection","CDV genome","analyzed Hungarian strains","vaccine strains","couple of strains","non-European strains","different CDV genotypes","Hungary","canine distemper virus","necropsy of dogs","European isolates","Denmark","canine population","phocine distemper virus","North America","preserved field samples","new differential diagnostic test","proper diagnosis of dogs","primer pair specific","large polymerase region","high similarity","high risk","diagnostic purposes","set of primers","Various organs","new cluster","appropriate primers","wild-type CDVs","various veterinary clinics","polymerase chain reaction","so-called Arctic group of CDVs","neurological signs","acute clinical symptoms","restriction fragment length polymorphism","laboratory","nasal swabs","RFLP","clinicians","Germany","pathological changes","animals","China","reliable differentiation","bases-long segment","ill patients","assay","urine","blood","Italy","hemagglutinin","PDV","Baikal seals","Phoca sibirica","distant regions","Turkey","directions","phylogenetical analysis","Greenland","results","mink","USA","distinct PCRs","amplicons","study"],"language":"en"},

RNA structure organization as well as RNA-protein interaction plays a fundamental role in internal initiation. IRES activity has been mainly analyzed in the context of reporter genes, lacking regions of the viral genome potentially affecting translation efficiency. With the aim to understand the vulnerability of the IRES and translation start region to small molecules in the context of the viral genome, we designed a set of customized RNase-resistant 2\u2032O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides (2\u2032OMe AONs) based on RNA structure data. These AONs were then used to monitor their capacity to interfere viral RNA translation, and thus, to inhibit virus yield. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA translation can be initiated at two in-frame AUG codons. We show here that a 2\u2032OMe AON complementary to AUG2 inhibited viral multiplication more efficiently than the one that targeted AUG1. Furthermore, the response of the viral RNA to AONs targeting the IRES region denoted important differences between tissue culture cells and cell-free systems, reinforcing the need to analyze viral RNA response in living cells. Importantly, we have identified four specific motifs within the IRES element that are targets for viral inhibitors both in tissue culture cells and in cell-free systems. The identified targets define accessible regions to small molecules, which disturb either the RNA structural organization or the RNA-protein interactions needed to initiate translation in FMDV RNA.","publish_time":"2012-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fajardo, Teodoro; Rosas, Maria Flora; Sobrino, Francisco; Martinez-Salas, Encarnacion","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c229a350536a9e087003fb14e9e52aab0245d2ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3399821.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0041382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22815996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IRES","AON"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA translation","viral RNA response","FMDV RNA","RNA structure organization","Translation initiation of picornavirus RNA","RNA-protein interactions","RNA structural organization","RNA structure data","viral genome","viral inhibitors","viral multiplication","IRES region","IRES element","translation efficiency","IRES activity","OMe AONs","tissue culture cells","living cells","small molecules","cell-free systems","internal initiation","identified targets","lacking regions","accessible regions","virus yield","OMe AON complementary","context of reporter genes","mouth disease virus","internal ribosome entry site","important differences","O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides","fundamental role","AUG2","set of customized RNase-resistant","need","Foot","specific motifs","vulnerability","capacity","initiator codon","frame","codons","aim","AUG1"],"language":"en"},

The unpredictability of the emergence of future virus threats demands the capability to rapidly develop safe, effective vaccines.

Accordingly, DCs are considered to be a major target in the development of immunomodulating compounds. In this study, the effect of niclosamide, a Food and Drug Administration-approved antihelminthic drug, on the activation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived DCs was examined. Our experimental results show that niclosamide reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression of LPS-activated DCs. In addition, niclosamide also affected the expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules and influenced the ability of the cells to take up antigens. Therefore, in mixed cell cultures composed of syngeneic OVA-specific T cells and DCs, niclosamide-treated DCs showed a decreased ability to stimulate T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03B3 production. Furthermore, intravenous injection of niclosamide also attenuated contact hypersensitivity (CHS) in mice during sensitization with 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene. Blocking the LPS-induced activation of MAPK-ERK, JNK and NF-\u03BAB may contribute to the inhibitory effect of niclosamide on DC activation. Collectively, our findings suggest that niclosamide can manipulate the function of DCs. These results provide new insight into the immunopharmacological role of niclosamide and suggest that it may be useful for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders or DC-mediated autoimmune diseases.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Chieh-Shan; Li, Yi-Rong; Chen, Jeremy J.W.; Chen, Ying-Che; Chu, Chiang-Liang; Pan, I-Hong; Wu, Yu-Shan; Lin, Chi-Chen","journal":"Cellular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a60911da5cd26b915a667843c296179d810d78e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094312.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2013.12.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008874913002062; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0008874913002062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561310/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["niclosamide-treated DCs","activated DCs","function of DCs","inhibitory effect of niclosamide","immunopharmacological role of niclosamide","intravenous injection of niclosamide","DC activation","chemokine expression of LPS","stimulated murine bone marrow-derived DCs","LPS-induced activation of MAPK","activation of lipopolysaccharide","T cell proliferation","Abstract Dendritic cells","syngeneic OVA-specific T cells","expression of MHC","decreased ability","experimental results","Drug Administration-approved antihelminthic drug","pro-inflammatory cytokine","innate immune system","mixed cell cultures","treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders","initiation of adaptive immune responses","ERK","Food","contact hypersensitivity","mice","JNK","CHS","IFN-\u03B3 production","NF-\u03BAB","new insight","environment","major target","costimulatory molecules","sensing","development of immunomodulating compounds","autoimmune diseases","dinitro","sensitization","study","addition","fluorobenzene","antigens","findings"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to reveal the spatio-temporal patterns of TB in the Qinghai province, which could be helpful in the planning and implementing key preventative measures. METHODS: We extracted data of reported TB cases in the Qinghai province from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) during January 2009 to December 2016. The Kulldorff\u2019s retrospective space-time scan statistics, calculated by using the discrete Poisson probability model, was used to identify the temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal clusters of TB at the county level in Qinghai. RESULTS: A total of 48,274 TB cases were reported from 2009 to 2016 in Qinghai. Results of the Kulldorff\u2019s scan revealed that the TB cases in Qinghai were significantly clustered in spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal distribution. The most likely spatio-temporal cluster (LLR = 2547.64, RR = 4.21, P \u003C 0.001) was mainly concentrated in the southwest of Qinghai, covering seven counties and clustered in the time frame from September 2014 to December 2016. CONCLUSION: This study identified eight significant space-time clusters of TB in Qinghai from 2009 to 2016, which could be helpful in prioritizing resource assignment in high-risk areas for TB control and elimination in the future.

Recent studies have identified a new genus within the Orthomyxoviridae family. This newly identified pathogen, D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK), first identified in pigs with influenza-like illness was classified as the influenza D virus (IDV) which is distantly related to the previously characterized human influenza C virus. Several other back-to-back studies soon suggested cattle as the natural reservoir and possible involvement of IDV in the bovine respiratory disease complex was established. Not much is known about its likelihood to cause disease in humans, but it definitely poses a potential threat as an emerging pathogen in cattle-workers.

Drug resistance is a well-documented instance that is generally driven by the selective pressure of drugs on both the replication of the pathogen within hosts and its transmission between hosts. Management of drug resistance therefore requires the development of treatment strategies that can impede the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. This study evaluates various treatment strategies for influenza infection as a case study by comparing the long-term epidemiological outcomes predicted by deterministic and stochastic versions of a homogeneously mixing (mean-field) model and those predicted by a heterogeneous model that incorporates spatial pair-wise correlation. We discuss the importance of three major parameters in our evaluation: the basic reproduction number, the population level of treatment, and the degree of clustering as a key parameter determining the structure of heterogeneous interactions. The results show that, as a common feature in all models, high treatment levels during the early stages of disease outset can result in large resistant outbreaks, with the possibility of a second wave of infection appearing in the pair-approximation model. Our simulations demonstrate that, if the basic reproduction number exceeds a threshold value, the population-wide spread of the resistant pathogen emerges more rapidly in the pair-approximation model with significantly lower treatment levels than in the homogeneous models. We tested an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. The findings indicate that the overall disease incidence is reduced as the degree of clustering increases, and a longer delay should be considered for implementing the large-scale treatment.","publish_time":"2009-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alexander, Murray E.; Dietrich, Sarah M.; Hua, Yi; Moghadas, Seyed M.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c566c4ebfc7530f0599af5867aa5f8ef56cab508.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127136.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519309001362; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.03.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19344730/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519309001362","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population level of treatment","large-scale treatment","high treatment levels","lower treatment levels","various treatment strategies","development of treatment strategies","onset of aggressive treatment","pair-approximation model","heterogeneous model","population-wide spread","basic reproduction number","control of disease","resistant pathogen","Management of drug resistance","hosts","overall disease incidence","degree of clustering increases","influenza infection","case study","early stages of disease outset","wave of infection","spatial pair-wise correlation","homogeneous models","large resistant outbreaks","structure of heterogeneous interactions","threshold value","long-term epidemiological outcomes","ruinous consequences","key parameter","possibility","evaluation","evolutionary responses of infectious pathogens","stochastic versions","replication","common feature","well-documented instance","time","major parameters","longer delay","findings","transmission","emergence","selective pressure of drugs","antiviral strategy","mean-field","importance","results","simulations"],"language":"en"},

Public health is being attacked with influenza containing new genes from a genetic assortment between animals and humankind. Unfortunately, the population does not have immunity for mutant genes and is attacked in every viral outbreak season. For these reasons, fast and accurate devices are in high demand. As currently used methods like Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests lack specificity, time and cost-savings, new methods are being developed. In the article, various novel detection methods, such as electrical and optical were compared. Different viral elements used as detection targets and analysis parameters, such as sensitivity and specificity, were presented and discussed.","publish_time":"2018-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dzi\u0105bowska, Karolina; Czaczyk, El\u017Cbieta; Nidzworski, Dawid","journal":"Biosensors (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfd557d8a310c0304ab52a34835e0f5537c88413.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6315519.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340339/; https://doi.org/10.3390/bios8040094","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnostic methods","new methods","used methods","influenza virus","threat of influenza","various novel detection methods","contemporary prevention methods","detection targets","early detection","new genes","article","Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests lack specificity","untreated viral infection","Different viral elements","viral outbreak season","accurate devices","accurate treatment","mutant genes","time","cost-savings","genetic assortment","analysis parameters","vaccines","fatal effect","animals","newest trends","high demand","humankind","immunity","reasons","sensitivity","ability","basic affairs","population","humans","Public health","Awareness","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

All samples were further tested for presence of fungi (cultures maintained for up to 28 days and colonies counted and identified microscopically) and for metal and trace element concentration by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry and atomic emission spectrometry. Surface water samples were tested for dissolved oxygen and presence of pathogenic leptospiral bacteria. The Spearman correlation method was used to assess the association between the endpoints for these field/laboratory analyses and incidence of cancer of the renal pelvis (RPC) based on data obtained from the Louisiana Tumor Registry for the five Parishes included in the study. Significant associations were revealed between the cancer rate and the presence in drinking water of organic compounds, the fungi Zygomycetes, the nutrients PO(4) and NH(3), and 13 chemical elements. Presence of human pathogenic leptospires was detected in four out of eight (50%) of the surface water sites sampled. The present study of a stable rural population examined possible linkages between aquifers containing chemically reactive lignite deposits, hydrologic conditions favorable to the\u2423leaching and transport of toxic organic compounds from the lignite into the groundwater, possible microbial contamination, and RPC risk.","publish_time":"2006-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bunnell, Joseph E.; Tatu, Calin A.; Bushon, Rebecca N.; Stoeckel, Donald M.; Brady, Amie M.

Sequencing revealed that wild-type PEDVs ORF3 genes had a single ORF of 675 nucleotides encoding a protein of 224 amino acids with a predicted M (r) of 25.1\u201325.3 kDa. Attenuated-type PEDVs ORF3 genes had a single ORF of 624 nucleotides encoding a protein of 207 amino acids with a predicted M (r) of 23.4 kDa. The coding region of the ORF3 gene of attenuated-type PEDVs including attenuated DR13, KPED-9, and P-5V had 51 nucleotide deletions that were not found in the ORF3 genes of wild-type PEDVs including CV777, Br1/87, LZC, parent DR13, and 12 field samples. In addition, attenuated-type PEDVs have previously been found to exhibit reduced pathogenicity in pigs. Therefore, 51 nucleotide deletions appear to be meaningful and may be significant for PEDV pathogenicity, because they lead to changes in the predicted amino acid sequences of attenuated-type PEDVs. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the partial ORF3 gene including 51 nucleotide deletions revealed that all PEDVs fell into two types, wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs. Wild-type PEDVs containing parent DR13 and 12 field samples had RT-PCR products of 245 bp in size, while attenuated-type PEDVs containing PEDV vaccine strains (attenuated DR13, KPED-9, P-5V) had products of 194 bp. In addition, all PEDV vaccine strains were used as live virus vaccine, because they previously exhibited a reduced pathogenicity in pigs. Therefore, large deletion region, which is comprise 17 amino acid deletions caused by 51 nucleotide deletions and is seen in all PED live vaccine strains, may be important site for PEDV pathogenicity, and we can use it for differentiation of wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs.","publish_time":"2007-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Seong-Jun; Moon, Hyoung-Joon; Luo, Yuzi; Kim, Hye-Kwon; Kim, Eun-Mi; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Song, Dae-Sub; Kang, Bo-Kyu; Lee, Chul-Seung; Park, Bong-Kyun","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5dbdae1a2d7e86db80696e2c26571c3f1138dd3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088598.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088598/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozcw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuated DR13","wild-type PEDVs ORF3 genes","ORF3 gene of attenuated","ORF3 genes of wild","parent DR13","nucleotide deletions","predicted amino acid sequences of attenuated","PEDV pathogenicity","PEDV vaccine strains","amino acid deletions","functions of wild","differentiation of wild","partial ORF3 gene","KPED","type porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses","amino acids","field samples","reduced pathogenicity","PED live vaccine strains","live virus vaccine","single ORF","RT-PCR products","protein","nucleotides","addition","pigs","kDa","coding region","large deletion region","Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","important site","changes","Br1","size","CV777","bp","LZC","open reading frame","Sequencing","types"],"language":"en"},

Their analysis was based on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that assumes exponentially distributed infectious periods. More recent analyses have established that the standard final size formula is valid regardless of the distribution of infectious periods, but that it fails to be correct in the presence of certain kinds of heterogeneous mixing (e.g., if there is a core group, as for sexually transmitted diseases). We review previous work and establish more general conditions under which Kermack and McKendrick\u0027s formula is valid. We show that the final size formula is unchanged if there is a latent stage, any number of distinct infectious stages and/or a stage during which infectives are isolated (the durations of each stage can be drawn from any integrable distribution). We also consider the possibility that the transmission rates of infectious individuals are arbitrarily distributed\u2014allowing, in particular, for the existence of super-spreaders\u2014and prove that this potential complexity has no impact on the final size formula. Finally, we show that the final size formula is unchanged even for a general class of spatial contact structures. We conclude that whenever a new respiratory pathogen emerges, an estimate of the expected magnitude of the epidemic can be made as soon the basic reproduction number \u211D(0) can be approximated, and this estimate is likely to be improved only by more accurate estimates of \u211D(0), not by knowledge of any other epidemiological details.","publish_time":"2006-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Junling; Earn, David J.

Even though it can cause tracheal lesions, its adverse effects on the trachea have not been sufficiently studied. The present study investigated tracheal changes in Arbor Acres broilers (Gallus gallus) induced by high concentration of ammonia using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based proteome analysis. In total, 3,706 proteins within false discovery rate of 1% were identified, including 119 significantly differentially expressed proteins. Functional analysis revealed that proteins related to immune response and muscle contraction were significantly enriched. With respect to the immune response, up-regulated proteins (like FGA) were pro-inflammatory, while down-regulated proteins participated in antigen processing and antigen presenting (like MYO1G), immunoglobulin and cathelicidin production (like fowlicidin-2), and immunodeficiency (like PTPRC). Regarding muscle contraction, all differentially expressed proteins (like TPM1) were up-regulated. An over-expression of mucin, which is a common feature of airway disease, was also observed. Additionally, the transcriptional alterations of 6 selected proteins were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Overall, proteomic changes suggested the onset of airway obstruction and diminished host defense in trachea after ammonia exposure. These results may serve as a valuable reference for future interventions against ammonia toxicity.

Because of its relatively high transmissibility and mortality upon infection, probable SARS patients were quarantined and treated with special and intensive care. Therefore, instant and accurate laboratory confirmation of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection has become a worldwide interest. For this need, we purified recombinant proteins including the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M), and truncated forms of the spike protein (S1\u2013S7) of SARS-CoV inEscherichia coli. The six proteins N, E, M, S2, S5, and S6 were used for Western blotting (WB) to detect various immunoglobulin classes in 90 serum samples from 54 probable SARS patients. The results indicated that N was recognized in most of the sera. In some cases, S6 could be recognized as early as 2 or 3 days after illness onset, while S5 was recognized at a later stage. Furthermore, the result of recombinant-protein-based WB showed a 90% agreement with that of the whole-virus-based immunofluorescence assay. Combining WB with existing RT-PCR, the laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV infection was greatly enhanced by 24.1%, from 48.1% (RT-PCR alone) to 72.2%. Finally, our results show that IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV can be detected within 1 week after illness onset in a few SARS patients.","publish_time":"2004-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Ho-Sheng; Hsieh, Yueh-Chun; Su, In-Jen; Lin, Ting-Hsiang; Chiu, Shu-Chun; Hsu, Yu-Fen; Lin, Jih-Hui; Wang, Mei-Ching; Chen, Jeou-Yuan; Hsiao, Pei-Wen; Chang, Geen-Dong; Wang, Andrew H. -J.; Ting, Hsien-Wei; Chou, Chih-Ming; Huang, Chang-Jen","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3610f7100c6607d48948b279c3b46e056704035e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089234/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","WB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","probable SARS patients","SARS-CoV inEscherichia coli","accurate laboratory confirmation of SARS","proteins N","protein-based WB","S5","recombinant proteins","illness onset","S6","results","existing RT-PCR","spike protein","result of recombinant","virus-based immunofluorescence assay","serum samples","associated coronavirus","S7","mortality","various immunoglobulin classes","atypical pneumonia","symptoms similar","S1","new disease","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","truncated forms","envelope","nucleocapsid","S2","IgA antibodies","week","high transmissibility","Western blotting","global alert","membrane","days","intensive care","later stage","need","agreement","cases","sera"],"language":"en"},

Conditions are given for bistability of equilibria to occur, where trajectories with distinct initial values could result in either a major outbreak where the disease spreads to the whole population or a lesser outbreak where some members of the population remain uninfected. This dynamic behavior did not arise in a SARS model without asymptomatic infective class studied by Hsu and Hsieh (SIAM J. Appl. Math. 66(2), 627\u2013647, 2006).

Several remarkable advantages have been achieved in the development of VLPs as gene therapy tools and new nanomaterials. The analysis of published data reveals that at least 110 VLPs have been constructed from viruses belonging to 35 different families. This review therefore discusses the main principles in the cloning of viral structural genes, the relevant host systems and the purification procedures that have been developed. In addition, the methods that are used to characterize the structural integrity, stability, and components, including the encapsidated nucleic acids, of newly synthesized VLPs are analyzed.

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiologic feature of E. coli O157:H7 strains in China. 105 E. coli O157:H7 isolates were collected from various hosts and places over 9 years. A multilocus sequence typing scheme (MLST) was applied for bacteria genotyping and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for virulence factor identification. Seven new MLST sequence types (STs), namely ST836, ST837, ST838, ST839, ST840, ST841, and ST842 were identified, which grouped into two lineages. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the most two frequent STs in China, ST837 and ST836, may be the derivatives of E. coli O157:H7 Sakai or E. coli O157:H7 EDL933.

As of January 2014, 275 cases of H7N9-infected patients had been reported, highlighting the urgency of identifying biomarkers for predicting disease severity and fatal outcomes. Here, we show that plasma levels of angiotensin II, a major regulatory peptide of the renin\u2013angiotensin system, are markedly elevated in H7N9 patients and are associated with disease progression. Moreover, the sustained high levels of angiotensin II in these patients are strongly correlated with mortality. The predictive value of angiotensin II is higher than that of C-reactive protein and some clinical parameters such as the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen).

The mortality rate was significantly higher among those with positive blood cultures during the aplastic phase, 44/164 (27%) than in those without bacteraemia, 25/336 (7%). Death directly caused by sepsis was unusual in patients with \u03B1-streptococci or CNS-bacteraemia (8/146, 5%). In contrast, three of seven patients with gram-negative bacteraemia died of the infection. However, in patients with bacteraemia, 21 of 44 deaths were attributable to invasive fungal infections (18 candida, three aspergillus; autopsy findings). Among patients with negative blood cultures during the aplastic phase, 6/25 died of invasive fungal infection (three candida, one saccaromyces and two aspergillus). This indicates that early bacteraemia is associated with death from invasive fungal infection. Therefore, efforts to shorten the neutropenic period after BMT, prevention, early detection of invasive fungal infections and adjustments of immnosuppressive regimens when marrow from an unrelated donor is used, may improve the outcome after BMT.","publish_time":"1998-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sparrelid, E; H\u00E4gglund, H; Remberger, M; Ringd\u00E9n, O; L\u00F6nnqvist, B; Ljungman, P; Andersson, J","journal":"Bone Marrow Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d79eb94800ad0dcfb05f3bf9b7af0f43209f3e7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091628/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","early bacteraemia","gram-negative bacteraemia","BMT","CNS-bacteraemia","Episodes of bacteraemia","aplastic phase","early detection of invasive fungal infections","negative blood cultures","positive blood cultures","\u03B1-streptococci","candida","unrelated donor","aspergillus","cases","allogeneic bone marrow","risk factors","mortality rate","Gram-negative bacteria","significant risk factor","coagulase-negative staphylococci","recipients","prevention","adjustments of immnosuppressive regimens","microbial aetiology","incidence","univariate regression analysis","deaths","neutropenic period","sepsis","Gram-positive cocci","autopsy findings","saccaromyces","efforts","days","outcome","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Ideally, vaccines should induce a lifelong protective immunity against the target pathogen while not causing clinical or pathological signs of diseases in the vaccinated animals. However, such ideal vaccines are rare in the veterinary field. Many vaccines are either of limited effectiveness or have harmful side effects. In addition, there are still severe diseases with no effective vaccines. A very important criterion for an ideal vaccine in veterinary medicine is low cost; this is especially important in developing countries and even more so for poultry vaccination, where vaccines must sell for a few cents a dose. Traditional approaches include inactivated vaccines, attenuated live vaccines and subunit vaccines. Recently, genetic engineering has been applied to design new, improved vaccines. Adenovirus vectors are highly efficient for gene transfer in a broad spectrum of cell types and species. Moreover, adenoviruses often induce humoral, mucosal and cellular immune responses to antigens encoded by the inserted foreign genes. Thus, adenoviruses have become a vector of choice for delivery and expression of foreign proteins for vaccination. Consequently, the market requirements for adenovirus vaccines are increasing, creating a need for production methodologies of concentrated vectors with warranted purity and efficacy. This review summarizes recent developments and approaches of adenovirus production and purification as the application of these vectors, including successes and failures in clinical applications to date.","publish_time":"2005-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferreira, T B; Alves, P M; Aunins, J G; Carrondo, M J T","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7136066a42782369e2180e54010553e5fd7bbe4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091679.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091679/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adenovirus vaccines","ideal vaccines","effective vaccines","live vaccines","inactivated vaccines","subunit vaccines","improved vaccines","Adenovirus vectors","veterinary medicine","approaches of adenovirus production","veterinary field","adenoviruses","production methodologies of concentrated vectors","clinical applications","Traditional approaches","severe diseases","important criterion","poultry vaccination","pathological signs of diseases","expression of foreign proteins","inserted foreign genes","antigens","gene transfer","broad spectrum of cell types","target pathogen","warranted purity","cellular immune responses","low cost","inexpensive prophylactic tool","delivery","failures","successes","lifelong protective immunity","recent developments","purification","need","vector of choice","design new","species","efficacy","limited effectiveness","vaccinated animals","effects","date","review","market requirements","genetic engineering","developing countries","addition","cents","dose"],"language":"en"},

Five copies of early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) binding elements were identified in the intron of HSV-1 ICP22 (infected cell protein No. 22) gene, leading to the hypothesis that Egr-1 binds to the viral genome and regulates the viral gene expression. Transient co-transfection assays indicated that Egr-1 negatively regulated the transcription of both full-length and intron-removed ICP22 promoters. The same assays also revealed that Egr-1 repressed ICP4 (infected cell protein No. 4) promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner but showed less inhibition when the intron was removed. Histone deacetylation was not involved in this regulation since histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A did not exhibit any effect on Egr-1-mediated repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Egr-1 reduced the binding of Sp1 to the promoters and that the co-repressor Nab2 (NGFI-A/EGR1-binding protein) was recruited to the proximity of ICP4 in the presence of Egr-1. These results suggested that the multifunctional transcription factor Egr-1 can repress HSV-1 immediate-early gene expression through the recruitment of co-repressor Nab2 and reduction of Sp1 occupancy, and thus may play a critical role in HSV-1 gene silencing during latency.","publish_time":"2007-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bedadala, Gautam R; Pinnoji, Rajeswara C; Hsia, Shao-Chung V","journal":"Cell Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aeeca1fc5e31a663adf2fafe4eac94703ab20c45.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092374.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092374/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of Egr","gene silencing","intron of HSV","viral gene expression","multifunctional transcription factor Egr","immediate-early gene expression","binding of Sp1","infected cell protein","EGR1-binding protein","copies of early growth response gene","recruitment of co-repressor Nab2","ICP22 promoters","Transient co-transfection assays","binding elements","Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays","viral genome","repressed ICP4","proximity of ICP4","Histone deacetylation","reduction of Sp1 occupancy","histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin","herpes simplex virus type","promoter activity","molecular mechanisms","regulation","NGFI","dose-dependent manner","latent infection","binds","critical role","results","inhibition","effect","hypothesis","latency","mediated repression"],"language":"en"},

The fusion subunits of lentiviruses and alpha-, beta-, delta- and gammaretroviruses have a very conserved domain organization and conserved features of secondary structure, making them suitable for phylogenetic analyses. Such analyses, along with sequence comparisons, reveal evidence of numerous recombination events in which retroviruses have acquired envelope glycoproteins from heterologous sequences. Thus, the envelope gene (env) can have a history separate from that of the polymerase gene (pol), which is the most commonly used gene in phylogenetic analyses of retroviruses. Focusing on the fusion subunits of the genera listed above, we describe three distinct types of retroviral envelope glycoproteins, which we refer to as gamma-type, avian gamma-type and beta-type. By tracing these types within the \u2018fossil record\u2019 provided by endogenous retroviruses, we show that they have surprisingly distinct evolutionary histories and dynamics, with important implications for cross-species transmissions and the generation of novel lineages.

METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020. RESULTS: All 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 \u00D7 10(9) cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 \u00D7 10(9) cells per L).

Study design We reviewed clinical history, diagnostic studies, explant histology, genetic sequence results, and post-transplant course for 6 infants with atypical ACDMPV who underwent bilateral lung transplantation at St. Louis Children\u0027s Hospital. We compared their histology with infants with classic ACDMPV and compared their outcomes with infants transplanted for other indications. Results In contrast with neonates with classic ACDPMV who present with severe hypoxemia and refractory pulmonary hypertension within hours of birth, none of the infants with atypical ACDMPV presented with progressive neonatal respiratory failure. Three infants had mild neonatal respiratory distress and received nasal cannula oxygen. Three other infants had no respiratory symptoms at birth and presented with hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension at 2-3 months of age. Bilateral lung transplantation was performed at 4-20 months of age. Unlike in classic ACDMPV, histopathologic findings were not distributed uniformly and were not diffuse. Three subjects had apparent nonmosaic genetic defects involving FOXF1. Two infants had extrapulmonary anomalies (posterior urethral valves, inguinal hernia). Three transplanted children are alive at 5-16 years of age, similar to outcomes for infants transplanted for other indications. Lung explants from infants with atypical ACDMPV demonstrated diagnostic but nonuniform histopathologic findings. Conclusions The 1- and 5-year survival rates for infants with atypical ACDMPV are similar to infants transplanted for other indications.

RSV P recruits multiple proteins to the polymerase complex and, with the exception of its oligomerization domain, is thought to be intrinsically disordered. Despite their critical roles in RSV transcription and replication, structures of L and P have remained elusive. Here, we describe the 3.2-\u00C5 cryo-EM structure of RSV L bound to tetrameric P. The structure reveals a striking tentacular arrangement of P, with each of the four monomers adopting a distinct conformation. The structure also rationalizes inhibitor escape mutants and mutations observed in live-attenuated vaccine candidates.

Although neuroinflammatory mechanisms may contribute to brain tissue destruction, the induction pathways and potential roles of specific chemokines in TBEV-mediated neurological disease are poorly understood. METHODS: BALB/c mice were intracerebrally injected with TBEV, followed by evaluation of chemokine and cytokine profiles using protein array analysis. The virus-infected mice were treated with the CC chemokine antagonist Met-RANTES or anti-RANTES mAb to determine the role of RANTES in affecting TBEV-induced neurological disease. The underlying signaling mechanisms were delineated using RANTES promoter luciferase reporter assay, siRNA-mediated knockdown, and pharmacological inhibitors in human brain-derived cell culture models. RESULTS: In a mouse model, pathological features including marked inflammatory cell infiltrates were observed in brain sections, which correlated with a robust up-regulation of RANTES within the brain but not in peripheral tissues and sera. Antagonizing RANTES within CNS extended the survival of mice and reduced accumulation of infiltrating cells in the brain after TBEV infection. Through in vitro studies, we show that virus infection up-regulated RANTES production at both mRNA and protein levels in human brain-derived cell lines and primary progenitor-derived astrocytes. Furthermore, IRF-3 pathway appeared to be essential for TBEV-induced RANTES production. Site mutation of an IRF-3-binding motif abrogated the RANTES promoter activity in virus-infected brain cells. Moreover, IRF-3 was activated upon TBEV infection as evidenced by phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF-3, while blockade of IRF-3 activation drastically reduced virus-induced RANTES expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings together provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying RANTES production induced by TBEV, highlighting its potential importance in the process of neuroinflammatory responses to TBEV infection.

Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus.

The nature of the innate immune response to hMPV in naturally occurring infections in children is largely undescribed, and it is unknown if inflammasome activation is implicated in disease pathogenesis. We examined nasopharynx aspirates and blood samples from hMPV-infected children without detectable co-infections. The expression of inflammatory and antiviral genes were measured in nasal airway secretions by relative mRNA quantification while blood plasma proteins were determined by a multiplex immunoassay. Several genes were significantly up-regulated at mRNA and protein level in the hMPV infected children. Most apparent was the expression of the chemokine IP-10, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18 in addition to the interferon inducible gene ISG54. Interestingly, children experiencing more severe disease, as indicated by a severity index, had significantly more often up-regulation of the inflammasome-associated genes IL-1\u03B2 and NLRP3. Overall, our data point to cytokines, particularly inflammasome-associated, that might be important in hMPV mediated lung disease and the antiviral response in children with severe infection.

Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels. RESULT: Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (\u03B2 = 0.530, P \u003C .001) and N-terminal pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (\u03B2 = 0.613, P \u003C .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P \u003C .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (41 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 25.6% (43 of 168). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Tao; Fan, Yongzhen; Chen, Ming; Wu, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Lin; He, Tao; Wang, Hairong; Wan, Jing; Wang, Xinghuan; Lu, Zhibing","journal":"JAMA Cardiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/articlepdf/2763845/jamacardiology_guo_2020_oi_200026.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219356/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD","TnT","Plasma TnT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["elevated TnT levels","Plasma TnT levels","normal TnT levels","underlying CVD","elevation of TnT levels","prognosis of patients","mortality rates of patients","NT-proBNP levels","median","IQR","high risk of myocardial injury","association of underlying cardiovascular disease","significant dynamic changes of TnT","confirmed COVID","fatal outcome of COVID","plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels","hospitalization","vs","fatal outcomes","elevated TnTs","mortality rates of coronavirus disease","coronary heart disease","MAIN OUTCOMES","impact of cardiovascular complication","frequent malignant arrhythmias","angiotensin receptor blockers","elevation of troponin T","use of glucocorticoid therapy","Increasing numbers of confirmed cases","Demographic data","brain natriuretic peptide","positive linear correlation","retrospective single-center case series","laboratory findings","MEASURES","N-terminal pro","PARTICIPANTS","comorbidities","enzyme inhibitors","hypertension","interquartile range","IMPORTANCE","treatments","potential mechanism","cardiac dysfunction","Hospital of Wuhan City","age","China","SETTING","Information","cardiomyopathy","impending death","admission values","CONCLUSIONS","RELEVANCE","mean","SD","DESIGN","Inflammation","Aggressive treatment","RESULT","survivors","countries","continents","mechanical ventilation","years","OBJECTIVE","Analysis"],"language":"en"},

Within 2 d after contact-exposed poults were removed from the presence of PEMS-infected poults and returned to their respective treatment rooms to infect experimental poults, the experimental poults began to huddle together and show signs of the disease. When separated from the huddle, body temperatures of exposure poults were depressed significantly. Body temperatures decreased progressively through 8 d after exposure with a maximum depression of 2 C and returned to a normal level at 18 d after PEMS exposure. Similar decreasing patterns in serum glucose, inorganic phosphorus, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine were observed, with maximum decreases in these serum constituents being found between 8 and 13 d after PEMS exposure. There were significant correlations among decreasing body temperatures, decreasing serum constituents, and mortality in the PEMS-exposed poults. Daily mortality rates associated with PEMS began at 6 d and peaked at 9 d after PEMS exposure. Mortality rates decreased from 9 to 15 d after experimental PEMS exposure.

By PCR, 25 (24%, n=104) samples tested positive for CPV. Based on analysis of the complete deduced VP2 amino acid sequences, 20 of the KNA CPV strains were assigned to new CPV-2a (also designated as CPV-2a-297A). On the other hand, the VP2 genes of the remaining 5 strains were partially characterized, or could not be sequenced. New CPV-2a was the predominant CPV variant in St. Kitts, contrasting the molecular epidemiology of CPV variants reported in most studies from nearby North and South American countries. By RT-PCR, CCoVs were detected in 5 samples (4.8%, n=104). Based on analysis of partial M-protein gene, the KNA CCoV strains were assigned to CCoV-I genotype, and were closely related to CCoV-I strains from Brazil.

Reinfection that occurs after transplantation has increased resistance to current interferon-based antiviral therapy and often leads to accelerated development of cirrhosis. Important risk factors for severe HCV recurrence are linked to immunosuppression. Owing to the lack of good randomized, controlled trials, the optimal choice of immunosuppressants is still debated. By contrast, much progress has been made in the understanding of HCV biology and the antiviral action of interferons. These new insights have greatly expanded our knowledge of the molecular interplay between HCV and immunosuppressive drugs. In this article, we explore the effect of different immunosuppressants on the complex cellular events involved in HCV infection and interferon signalling.

Regional economic integration not only stimulates labour mobility, but also achieve scale economy, both of which may also influence carbon dioxide (CO2) marginal abatement costs through affecting energy consumption, CO2 emissions, productivity growth, and technical progress. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies has currently concerned the influence of regional economic integration on CO2 marginal abatement costs. To fill this research gap, this study first theoretically clarifies the influence mechanism of regional economic integration on CO2 marginal abatement cost, and then empirically attempts to investigate their relationship in the context of China, with panel data models. To serve this purpose, the provincial CO2 marginal abatement cost and regional economic integration are estimated by parametric directional distance function and price-based approach, respectively. The results show that China\u0027s regional economic integration level indeed gradually improved over 2002\u20132011 except in 2003\u201304 and 2006\u201309 due to the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the sub-prime loan crisis. Moreover, evolution of regional economic integration indeed contributes to the increase of CO2 marginal abatement cost at 5% significance level. Using robust tests, it can be found that the results are also reliable and robust to sub-samples.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Weijun; Wang, Bo; Danish,; Wang, Zhaohua","journal":"Energy Economics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49856db3b4fa311a0a8a39c8f90ad0e15384afbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112461.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988318302287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287515/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2018.06.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140988318302287","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["influence of regional economic integration","evolution of regional economic integration","CO2 marginal abatement costs","influence mechanism of regional economic integration","China\u0027s regional economic integration level","provincial CO2 marginal abatement cost","increase of CO2 marginal abatement cost","CO2 emissions","regions","results","sub-samples","significance level","robust tests","sub-prime loan crisis","affecting energy consumption","SARS","parametric directional distance function","productivity growth","technology diffusion","price-based approach","spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","labour mobility","context of China","frequent trade","carbon dioxide","Abstract","barriers","study","purpose","panel data models","technical progress","scale economy","recent years","knowledge","research gap","relationship","studies","best"],"language":"en"},

We have previously shown that self-collected nasal swabs (NS) are feasible and as sensitive as clinician-collected nasal washes for detection of RV, but the additive benefit of self-collected throat swabs is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the added yield of self-collected nasal to throat swabs for detection of RV by PCR in patients with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. Study design Patients with URTI symptoms self-collected paired polyurethane foam NS and nylon flocked throat swabs and completed a symptom survey. Swabs were tested for 12 RV by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Descriptive, McNemar\u0027s, and Wilcoxon signed rank statistical tests were used. Results 115 paired nasal and throat swabs were collected from 63 individuals, with 71/115 (62%) positive for a RV by at least one specimen, including 51 positive by both, 17 positive by NS only, and 3 positive by throat swab only. The sensitivity of NS was 96% (95%CI: 88-99) versus 76% (95% CI: 65-85) in throat swabs, p\u003C0.001. The median PCR cycle threshold (Ct) in 51 concordant samples was lower (indicating higher viral concentration) in NS (25.1) versus throat swabs (32.0). The three samples positive only by throat swab had high Ct values (33.8, 36.2, and 38.8, all rhinovirus). Conclusion Self-collection of NS was significantly more sensitive than self collection of throat swabs for detection of RV by RT-PCR. The addition of throat sampling does not appear to increase the diagnostic load in the self-testing setting.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisher, Cynthia E.; Boeckh, Michael; Jerome, Keith R.; Englund, Janet; Kuypers, Jane","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8606243ca425de8287b5565519e91779accf38da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6587583.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30978619/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2019.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653219300757; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653219300757","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","URTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["self-collected nasal swabs","additive benefit of self-collected throat swabs","self collection of throat swabs","nylon flocked throat swabs","detection of RV","addition of throat sampling","Conclusion Self-collection of NS","added yield of self-collected nasal","sensitivity of NS","samples positive","URTI symptoms self-collected paired polyurethane foam NS","paired nasal","RT-PCR","self-testing setting","nasal washes","accurate detection of respiratory viruses","median PCR cycle threshold","concordant samples","Study design Patients","high Ct values","upper respiratory tract infection","Wilcoxon","higher viral concentration","clinician","real-time reverse transcription","McNemar\u0027s","diagnostic load","rank statistical tests","Results","Abstract Background","symptom survey","patient management","Objectives","specimen","individuals","rhinovirus"],"language":"en"},

One cause for skepticism is that biological correlates of the administrative and clinical data used in these systems have not been rigorously assessed. This study measures the value of respiratory data currently used in syndromic surveillance systems to detect respiratory infections by comparing it against criterion standard viral testing within a pediatric population. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study with prospective validation in the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care children\u2019s hospital. Children aged 7 years or younger who presented with a respiratory syndrome or who were tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, or enterovirus between January 1993 and June 2004 were included. We assessed the predictive ability of the viral tests by fitting generalized linear models to respiratory syndrome counts. Results Of 582,635 patient visits, 89,432 (15.4%) were for respiratory syndromes, and of these, 7,206 (8.1%) patients were tested for the viruses of interest. RSV was significantly related to respiratory syndrome counts (adjusted rate ratio [RR] 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.71). In multivariate models including all viruses tested, influenza virus was also a significant predictor of respiratory syndrome counts (RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.10). This model accounted for 81.6% of the observed variability in respiratory syndrome counts. Conclusion Respiratory syndromic surveillance data strongly correlate with virologic test results in a pediatric population, providing evidence of the biologic validity of such surveillance systems. Real-time outbreak detection systems relying on syndromic data may be an important adjunct to the current set of public health systems for the detection and surveillance of respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2006-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bourgeois, Florence T.; Olson, Karen L.; Brownstein, John S.; McAdam, Alexander J.; Mandl, Kenneth D.","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7a077009461dff9c3c5904aefbd4f1382148ecf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124214.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064405019621; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064405019621","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surveillance of respiratory infections","respiratory syndromes","value of respiratory data","respiratory syncytial virus","Conclusion Respiratory syndromic surveillance data","syndromic surveillance systems","syndromic data","significant predictor of respiratory syndrome counts","clinical data","parainfluenza virus","Real-time outbreak detection systems","current set of public health systems","pediatric population","Study objective","longitudinal study","RSV","viruses","key public health question","viral tests","multivariate models","virologic test results","fitting generalized linear models","criterion standard viral testing","adjusted rate ratio","biological correlates","prospective validation","important adjunct","early warning of infectious outbreaks","emergency department","adenovirus","biologic validity","tertiary care children\u2019s hospital","evidence","observed variability","predictive ability","cause","skepticism","enterovirus","confidence interval","years","patient visits","Methods","patients"],"language":"en"},

We excluded people with a previous total hip arthroplasty, a previous hip fracture, or a previous diagnosis of avascular necrosis. We used stratified Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for cirrhosis patients relative to reference individuals, adjusting for potential confounders. We used the cumulative incidence function to compute 5-year risks. RESULTS: We included 25,421 cirrhosis patients and 114,052 reference individuals.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal, combined nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum was collected from persons with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 viral cultures and synthetic positive controls (gBlocks, Integrated DNA Technologies) were tested using i) AusDiagnostics assay (AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd); ii) in-house developed assays targeting the E and RdRp genes; iii) multiplex PCR assay targeting endemic respiratory viruses. Discrepant SARS-CoV-2 results were resolved by testing the N, ORF1b, ORF1ab and M genes. RESULTS: Of 52 clinical samples collected from 50 persons tested, respiratory viruses were detected in 22 samples (42 %), including SARS CoV-2 (n = 5), rhinovirus (n = 7), enterovirus (n = 5), influenza B (n = 4), hMPV (n = 5), influenza A (n = 2), PIV-2 (n = 1), RSV (n = 2), CoV-NL63 (n = 1) and CoV-229E (n = 1). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in four additional samples by the AusDiagnostics assay. Using the in-house assays as the \u0022gold standard\u0022, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the AusDiagnostics assay was 100 %, 92.16 %, 55.56 % and 100 % respectively. The Ct values of the real-time in-house-developed PCR assay targeting the E gene was significantly lower than the corresponding RdRp gene assay when applied to clinical samples, viral culture and positive controls (mean 21.75 vs 28.1, p = 0.0031). CONCLUSIONS: The AusDiagnostics assay is not specific for the detection SARS-CoV-2. Any positive results should be confirmed using another NAT or sequencing.

Whether the N protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is antigenic remains to be elucidated. Using Western blot and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), the recombinant N proteins and the synthesized peptides derived from the N protein were screened in sera from SARS patients. All patient sera in this study displayed strong positive immunoreactivities against the recombinant N proteins, whereas normal sera gave negative immunoresponses to these proteins, indicating that the N protein of SARS-CoV is an antigenic protein. Furthermore, the epitope sites in the N protein were determined by competition experiments, in which the recombinant proteins or the synthesized peptides competed against the SARS-CoV proteins to bind to the antibodies raised in SARS sera. One epitope site located at the C-terminus was confirmed as the most antigenic region in this protein. A detailed screening of peptide with ELISA demonstrated that the amino sequence from Codons 371 to 407 was the epitope site at the C-terminus of the N protein.

Of 493 patients included in the study, 223 (45.2%) were aged \u2265 65 years, and 265 (53.7%) had one or more underlying diseases, mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus or dementia. In total, 281 microorganisms were identified in 250 (50.7%) patients, with two or more pathogens detected in 28 (5.7%) cases. Microbial diagnosis varied according to age, severity, co-morbidity and site-of-care, but there was much overlap among groups. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the single most prevalent organism in outpatients, patients admitted to hospital, and patients who died, either as a single pathogen or combined with another organism. Infections caused by \u2018atypical\u2019 pathogens were seen across all groups, including the elderly and patients with co-morbidities. Mortality varied according to the pneumonia severity index (PSI) of the pneumonia patient outcomes research team. Shock (OR 34.48), an age of \u003E 65 years (OR 25) and altered mental status (OR 9.92) were factors associated independently with 30-day mortality. Key findings from this study were the advanced age of the population with CAP, and the high prevalence of dementia as an underlying disease. The study also revealed that microbiological diagnosis of CAP remains problematic. Although certain epidemiological features may help to predict the microbial aetiology, the overlap among groups reduces the usefulness of this information in guiding therapeutic decisions. Greater effort should be made to improve identification methods for microbial pathogens causing CAP.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guti\u00E9rrez, F.; Masi\u00E1, M.; Rodr\u00EDguez, J.C.; Mirete, C.; Sold\u00E1n, B.; Padilla, S.; Hern\u00E1ndez, I.; Ory, F.

Understanding how host\u2013pathogen interactions have influenced the human immune system from an evolutionary perspective might contribute to unveiling the causes behind different immune-mediated disorders and promote the development of new strategies to detect and control such diseases.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dom\u00EDnguez-Andr\u00E9s, Jorge; Netea, Mihai G.","journal":"Trends in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd2f7e995d56e8f49df64e8f4d0fac23f3e5644c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106516.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471490619302108; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2019.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31786023/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1471490619302108","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["modern populations","human immune system","different immune-mediated disorders","functional variation of immune genes","various populations of modern humans","different environments","result of evolution","inflammatory diseases","evolution of mankind","large variety of infectious agents","local adaptations","causes","pathogen interactions","evolutionary perspective","Africa","emergence of autoimmune","development of new strategies","responses","infection","host","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Here, a new ferret model of Nipah virus pathogenesis is described where both respiratory and neurological disease are present in infected animals. Severe disease occurs with viral doses as low as 500 TCID(50) within 6 to 10 days following infection. The underlying pathology seen in the ferret closely resembles that seen in Nipah virus infected humans, characterized as a widespread multisystemic vasculitis, with virus replicating in highly vascular tissues including lung, spleen and brain, with recoverable virus from a variety of tissues. Using this ferret model a cross-reactive neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, m102.4, targeting the henipavirus G glycoprotein was evaluated in vivo as a potential therapeutic agent. All ferrets that received m102.4 ten hours following a high dose oral-nasal Nipah virus challenge were protected from disease while all controls died.

This immunization protocol elicited significant increases in serum and lachrymal levels of anti-IBV IgG antibodies and upregulated the expression of CMI response genes, such as those encoding CD8\u03B2 chain and Granzyme homolog A in tracheal and kidney tissues at 3, 7, and 11 days post-infection in the vaccinated chickens. Additionally, vaccinated and challenged chickens showed reduced viral loads and microscopic lesion counts in tracheal and kidney tissues, and their antibody and CMI responses were negatively correlated with viral loads in the trachea and kidney. In conclusion, the combination of live attenuated vaccine containing the Massachusetts strain with a booster dose of an inactivated vaccine, containing a BR-I IBV strain, confers effective protection against infection with nephropathogenic homologous IBV strain because of the induction of consistent memory immune responses mediated by IgG antibodies and TCD8 cells in the mucosal and systemic compartments of chickens submitted to this vaccination regime.","publish_time":"2019-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"dos SANTOS, Romeu Moreira; FERNANDO, Filipe Santos; MONTASSIER, Maria de F\u00E1tima Silva; SILVA, Ketherson Rodrigues; LOPES, Priscila Diniz; PAVANI, Caren; BORZI, Mariana Monezi; OKINO, Cintia Hiromi; MONTASSIER, Helio Jos\u00E9","journal":"J Vet Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60cc55d9df1b0ff215bcaefe413b7b6edc5eb182.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6483904.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.18-0065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867350/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMI"],"locations":["Massachusetts"],"keyphrases":["Massachusetts strain","nephropathogenic homologous IBV strain","CMI responses","vaccinated chickens","systemic compartments of chickens","booster dose","kidney tissues","combination of live attenuated vaccine","experimental homologous inactivated vaccine","priming dose of heterologous live attenuated Massachusetts vaccine","antibody","vaccination regime","lachrymal levels of anti-IBV IgG antibodies","strain of infectious bronchitis virus","reduced viral loads","induction of consistent memory immune responses","effective protection","nephropathogenic Brazilian","expression of CMI response genes","days post-infection","serum","microscopic lesion","significant increases","challenge","TCD8 cells","Granzyme homolog","immunization protocol","CD8\u03B2 chain","weeks","conclusion","trachea","study"],"language":"en"},

PAdV is species specific having only been isolated from swine, reducing the possibility of its spread to other animals or man following administration. When engineered to contain a foreign gene, recombinant PAdV (rPAdV) can be grown to high titres in tissue culture cells making it cheap to produce. Knowledge of the complete nucleotide sequence of the PAdV genome has enabled rationally directed insertions of foreign genes which remain stably inserted in the genome and can be expressed at high levels following delivery to the target host. Importantly, recombinant PAdV can be administered by injection or by the oral route in feed or drinking water. We have delivered a range of antigens and immunomodulatory molecules to commercially available pigs using rPAdV and found it to be a very effective delivery system. Significantly, recombinant PAdV serotype 3 is highly effective as a delivery vehicle even when administered in the face of high levels of artificially induced serotype specific neutralising antibody to the vector.","publish_time":"2005-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hammond, Jef M.; Johnson, Michael A.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/822e80d4e2b8f007b9064417387a6d47fd020b3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128824.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023303001710; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023303001710","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant PAdV serotype","PAdV genome","delivery vector","delivery vehicle","serotype specific vaccine","effective delivery system","face of high levels","high titres","rPAdV","species specific","swine","induced serotype specific neutralising antibody","tissue tropism","tissue culture cells","insertions of foreign genes","immunomodulatory molecules","oral route","complete nucleotide sequence","use","available pigs","ideal choice","animals","feed","drinking water","low grade pathogen","number of serotypes","virulence","qualities","injection","range of antigens","target host","Abstract Porcine adenovirus","man","spread","Knowledge","possibility","administration"],"language":"en"},

The first biologically active thymic extract was thymosin fraction V, the fractionation of which led to the isolation of a series of immunoactive polypeptides, including prothymosin alpha (proT\u03B1). ProT\u03B1 displays a dual role, intracellularly as a survival and proliferation mediator and extracellularly as a biological response modifier. Accordingly, inside the cell, proT\u03B1 is implicated in crucial intracellular circuits and may serve as a surrogate tumor biomarker, but when found outside the cell, it could be used as a therapeutic agent for treating immune system deficiencies. In fact, proT\u03B1 possesses pleiotropic adjuvant activity and a series of immunomodulatory effects (eg, anticancer, antiviral, neuroprotective, cardioprotective). Moreover, several reports suggest that the variable activity of proT\u03B1 might be exerted through different parts of the molecule. We first reported that the main immunoactive region of proT\u03B1 is the carboxy-terminal decapeptide proT\u03B1(100\u2013109). In conjunction with data from others, we also revealed that proT\u03B1 and proT\u03B1(100\u2013109) signal through Toll-like receptor 4. Although their precise molecular mechanism of action is yet not fully elucidated, proT\u03B1 and proT\u03B1(100\u2013109) are viewed as candidate adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we present a historical overview on the discovery and isolation of thymosins with emphasis on proT\u03B1 and data on some immune-related new activities of the polypeptide and smaller immunostimulatory peptides thereof.

The dsRNAs were extracted from symptomless pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh] plants cv. Erra Kandulu. This new virus with 4.64 kb genome was tentatively named Arhar cryptic virus-1 (ArCV-1). The genomic RNAs were amplified and characterized by sequence independent single primer amplification. The dsRNAs shared a highly conserved 16 nt 5\u2019 non-coding region (5\u2019-GATAATGATCCAAGGA-3\u2019). The largest dsRNA (dsRNA-1) was identified as the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (replicase), predicted to encode a putative 55.34 kDa protein (P1). The two other smaller dsRNAs (dsRNA-2 and dsRNA-3) predicted to encode for putative capsid proteins of 38.50kDa (P2) and 38.51kDa (P3), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ArCV-1 formed a clade together with Fragaria chiloensis cryptic virus, Rosa multiflora cryptic virus and Rose cryptic virus-1, indicating that ArCV-1 could be a new member of the genus Deltapartitivirus. ArCV-1 3D(pol) structure revealed several interesting features. The 3D(pol) in its full-length shares structural similarities with members of the family Caliciviridaeand family Picornaviridae. In addition, fourth dsRNA molecule (dsRNA-2A), not related to ArCV-1 genome, was found in the same plant tissue. The dsRNA-2A (1.6 kb) encodes a protein (P4), with a predicted size of 44.5 kDa. P4 shares similarity with coat protein genes of several cryptic viruses, in particular the bipartite cryptic viruses including Raphanus sativus cryptic virus-3.

By analysis of synonymous codon usage values in each ORF of PRRSV, the optimal codons for most amino acids were all C or G-ended codons except GAU for Asp, CAU for His, UUU for Phe and CCU for Pro. The synonymous codon usage patterns in different ORFs of PRRSV were different and genetically conserved. Among them, ORF1a, ORF4, ORF5 and ORF7 could cluster these strains into the two main serotypes (EU and US). Due to mutational pressure, compositional constraint played an important role in shaping the synonymous codon usage pattern in different ORFs, and the synonymous codon usage diversity in ORFs was correlated with gene function. The degree of CUB for some particular amino acids under strong selection pressure probably served as a potential genetic marker for each ORF in PRRSV. However, gene length and translational selection in nature had no effect on the synonymous codon usage pattern in PRRSV. These conclusions could not only offer an insight into the synonymous codon usage pattern and differentiation of gene function, but also assist in understanding the discrepancy of evolution among ORFs in PRRSV.","publish_time":"2010-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yong-sheng; Zhou, Jian-hua; Chen, Hao-tai; Ma, Li-na; Ding, Yao-zhong; Wang, Meng; Zhang, Jie","journal":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26029ce6e9b908af320d79f5386380f45578fb82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106271.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134810001085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20438864/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134810001085; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2010.04.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","EU","CUB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synonymous codon usage patterns","relative synonymous codon usage","synonymous codon usage diversity","codon usage bias","analysis of synonymous codon usage values","different ORFs of PRRSV","ORF of PRRSV","comparative analysis of codon usage pattern of open reading frames","gene length","differentiation of gene function","particular amino acids","strong selection pressure","translational selection","optimal codons","mutational pressure","degree of CUB","main serotypes","main genotypes of porcine reproductive","RSCU","effect","respiratory syndrome virus","nature","important role","CAU","compositional constraint","CCU","insight","potential genetic marker","ORF5","ORF7","UUU","strains","Asp","GAU","Phe","ORF1a","ORF4","EU","study","discrepancy of evolution","Abstract","conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Methods A qualitative study incorporating 20 focus groups was conducted between August 2010 and May 2011. HCWs from 7 hospitals in Vietnam were invited to participate. Results Issues associated with the availability of facemasks (medical and cloth masks) and respirators was the strongest theme to emerge from the discussion. Participants reported that it is not unusual for some types of facemasks to be unavailable during nonemergency periods. It was highlighted that the use of facemasks and respirators is not continuous, but rather is limited to selected situations, locations, and patients. Reuse of facemasks and respirators is also common in some settings. Finally, some participants reported believing that the reuse of facemasks, particularly cloth masks, is safe, whereas others believed that the reuse of masks put staff at risk of infection. Conclusions In low and middle-income countries, access to appropriate levels of personal protective equipment may be restricted owing to competing demands for funding in hospital settings. It is important that issues around reuse and extended use of medical masks/respirators and decontamination of cloth masks are addressed in policy documents to minimize the risk of infection.","publish_time":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Seale, Holly; Chi Dung, Tham; Maher, Lisa; Nga, Phan Thi; MacIntyre, C.

It has been linked to cancer, tumorgenesis, viral and bacterial pathogenesis. As a result it is considered a major target for intervention of these diseases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Herein, we report, for the first time, the synthesis and biological evaluation of a newly designed potent furin inhibitor that contains a highly reactive beta-turn inducing and radical generating \u201Cenediynyl amino acid\u201D (Eda) moiety. \u201CEda\u201D was inserted between P1 and P1\u2032 residues of hfurin(98\u2013112) peptide, derived from the primary cleavage site of furin\u0027s own prodomain. The resulting hexadecapeptide derivative inhibited furin in vitro with IC(50) \u223C40 nM when measured against the fluorogenic substrate Boc-RVRR-MCA. It also inhibited furin-mediated cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide derived from hSARS-CoV spike protein with IC(50) \u223C193 nM. Additionally it also blocked furin-processing of growth factors proPDGF-A, B and VEGF-C that are linked to tumor genesis and cancer. Circular dichroism study showed that this inhibitor displayed a predominantly beta-turn structure while western blots confirmed its ability to protect furin protein from self degradation.

Although many different types of IBV vaccines are used successfully, the ArkDPI serotype vaccine, when applied by spray, does not infect and replicate sufficiently to provide protection against homologous challenge. In this study, we examined a different Ark vaccine strain (Ark99), which is no longer used commercially due to its reactivity in one day old chicks, to determine if it could be further attenuated by passage in embryonated eggs but still provide adequate protection. Further attenuation of the Ark99 vaccine was achieved by passage in embryonated eggs but ArkGA P1, P20, and P40 (designated ArkGA after P1) were still too reactive to be suitable vaccine candidates. However, ArkGA P60 when given by spray had little or no vaccine reaction in one day old broiler chicks, and it induced protection from clinical signs and ciliostasis following homologous challenge. In addition, vaccinated and challenged birds had significantly less challenge virus, an important measure of protection, compared to non-vaccinated and challenged controls. The full-length genomes of viruses from egg passages 1, 20, 40, and 60 were sequenced using the Illumina platform and the data showed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had accumulated in regions of the genome associated with viral replication, pathogenicity, and cell tropism. ArkGA P60 accumulated the most SNPs in key genes associated with pathogenicity (polyprotein gene 1ab) and cell tropism (spike gene), compared to previous passages, which likely resulted in its more attenuated phenotype. These results indicate that the ArkGA P60 vaccine is safe for spray vaccination of broiler chicks and induces suitable protection against challenge with pathogenic Ark-type virus.","publish_time":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albanese, Grace A.; Lee, Dong-Hun; Cheng, I-Hsin N.; Hilt, Deborah A.; Jackwood, Mark W.; Jordan, Brian J.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30af52ef71cc3189e5162fa07b93bd4eb1286086.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115623.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.08.078; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18312283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30197283/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X18312283","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Illumina"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ArkGA P60 vaccine","Ark99 vaccine","challenge virus","suitable protection","vaccine reaction","ArkGA P1","induced protection","suitable vaccine candidates","adequate protection","designated ArkGA","homologous challenge","different Ark vaccine strain","day old chicks","ArkDPI serotype vaccine","spray vaccination of broiler chicks","day old broiler chicks","important measure of protection","pathogenicity","SNPs","embryonated eggs","cell tropism","day of hatch","attenuated phenotype","pathogenic Ark-type virus","different types of IBV vaccines","live attenuated vaccines mass","polyprotein gene","spike gene","egg passages","previous passages","avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","P20","data","clinical signs","ciliostasis","P40","single nucleotide polymorphisms","viral replication","key genes","commercial poultry","full-length genomes of viruses","Illumina platform","regions","birds","reactivity","results","controls","study","attenuation","addition"],"language":"en"},

The SARS\u2013CoV spike (S) glycoprotein mediates membrane fusion events during virus entry and virus-induced cell-to-cell fusion. The cytoplasmic portion of the S glycoprotein contains four cysteine-rich amino acid clusters. Individual cysteine clusters were altered via cysteine-to-alanine amino acid replacement and the modified S glycoproteins were tested for their transport to cell-surfaces and ability to cause cell fusion in transient transfection assays. Mutagenesis of the cysteine cluster I, located immediately proximal to the predicted transmembrane, domain did not appreciably reduce cell-surface expression, although S-mediated cell fusion was reduced by more than 50% in comparison to the wild-type S. Similarly, mutagenesis of the cysteine cluster II located adjacent to cluster I reduced S-mediated cell fusion by more than 60% compared to the wild-type S, while cell-surface expression was reduced by less than 20%. Mutagenesis of cysteine clusters III and IV did not appreciably affect S cell-surface expression or S-mediated cell fusion. The wild-type S was palmitoylated as evidenced by the efficient incorporation of 3H-palmitic acid in wild-type S molecules. S glycoprotein palmitoylation was significantly reduced for mutant glycoproteins having cluster I and II cysteine changes, but was largely unaffected for cysteine cluster III and IV mutants. These results show that the S cytoplasmic domain is palmitoylated and that palmitoylation of the membrane proximal cysteine clusters I and II may be important for S-mediated cell fusion.","publish_time":"2007-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petit, Chad M.; Chouljenko, Vladimir N.; Iyer, Arun; Colgrove, Robin; Farzan, Michael; Knipe, David M.; Kousoulas, K.

Control of the endemic neglected zoonotic diseases (NZDs) would benefit from a similar campaign, which needs the support of a global community. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The resolutions from all 66 World Health Assembly (WHA) meetings held between 1948 and 2013 were examined to determine how many contain a specific focus on any of the following eight NZDs as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO): anthrax, bovine tuberculosis (TB), brucellosis, Taenia solium cysticercosis, cystic echinococcosis (hydatidosis), leishmaniasis, rabies, and zoonotic human African trypanosomiasis (HAT or sleeping sickness). Twenty-one resolutions adopted in the 16 assemblies between 1948 and 2013 targeted one or more of these eight NZDs, representing 4% of the total resolutions on infectious diseases passed to date. The 2013 adoption of Resolution WHA66.12 targeting all 17 NTDs marks a change in approach by the WHA. Whereas previous resolutions have targeted the NTDs as separate entities, the new approach of the combined resolution will help increase the overall momentum to target these ancient diseases as coendemic clusters in endemic countries. However, three major NZDs remain outside this recent resolution: anthrax, brucellosis, and bovine TB. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The recent adoption of a specific resolution at the WHA in 2013 that emphasises a One Health approach for the successful control of 17 NTDs is a major development in advocacy.

However, their recognition is challenging because of the variety of viruses, heterogeneity of symptoms, the lack of awareness of clinicians, and limited surveillance efforts. Classical food- and waterborne viral disease outbreaks are mainly caused by caliciviruses, but the source of the virus is often not known and the foodborne mode of transmission is difficult to discriminate from human-to-human transmission. Atypical food- and waterborne viral disease can be caused by viruses such as hepatitis A and hepatitis E. In addition, a source of novel emerging viruses with a potential to spread via the food- and waterborne route is the repeated interaction of humans with wildlife. Wildlife-to-human adaptation may give rise to self- limiting outbreaks in some cases, but when fully adjusted to the human host can be devastating. Metagenomic sequencing has been investigated as a promising solution for surveillance purposes as it detects all viruses in a single protocol, delivers additional genomic information for outbreak tracing, and detects novel unknown viruses. Nevertheless, several issues must be addressed to apply metagenomic sequencing in surveillance. First, sample preparation is difficult since the genomic material of viruses is generally overshadowed by host- and bacterial genomes. Second, several data analysis issues hamper the efficient, robust, and automated processing of metagenomic data. Third, interpretation of metagenomic data is hard, because of the lack of general knowledge of the virome in the food chain and the environment. Further developments in virus-specific nucleic acid extraction methods, bioinformatic data processing applications, and unifying data visualization tools are needed to gain insightful surveillance knowledge from suspect food samples.","publish_time":"2017-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nieuwenhuijse, David F.; Koopmans, Marion P.

Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people\u0027s lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray\u2010based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Naru; Wang, Lili; Deng, Xiaoqian; Liang, Ruiying; Su, Meng; He, Chen; Hu, Lanfang; Su, Yudan; Ren, Jing; Yu, Fei; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d16f78176f69e3eb2258085f98fba710e6774d8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166954.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31944312/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25674","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["detection of common respiratory viruses","human respiratory syncytial virus","emerging viruses","effective detection of respiratory virus infections","simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses","causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections","appropriate diagnostic strategies","viral antigens","Multiplex assays","human adenovirus","novel emerging diagnostic methods","human rhinovirus","new diagnostic strategies","influenza virus","based assays","novel coronavirus","Conventional diagnostic tests","rapid detection of antiviral antibodies","appropriate treatment","common diseases","multiplex nucleic acid amplification","microarray","clinicians","development of modern technologies","great threats","epidemics","pneumonia outbreak","China","global public health","people\u0027s lives","nCoV","researchers","bacteria","Wuhan","Identification","review","unnecessary use of antibiotics","data","clinical laboratories"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN: Adults with THA were retrospectively identified in an electronic medical record PT database (October 1, 2004-April 30, 2010). Hierarchical linear modeling was used to evaluate growth curves and individual variations in function using the Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS). Investigated predictors were: sex, age, start time, and PT visit. RESULTS: A total of 147 (81 female, 66 male) postoperative THA patients were included in the study; mean age was 62.7 years (SD 10.6, range 45-91 years). The majority (79%) of patients initiated PT \u003C9 weeks postsurgery; predominately lower-functioning women started at \u22659 weeks. For patients initiating treatment at \u003C9 weeks, the curvilinear slopes of recovery were similar between sexes, although the predicted levels of functional status were lower for females than for males (P = .041). CONCLUSIONS: This study of usual physical therapy practice supports the findings from controlled studies that post-THA women enter and are discharged from outpatient PT with lower functional status than men. New findings suggest that functional status for early start patients steadily improves over 26 weeks postsurgery. Modeling change in clinical practice using outcomes measures acquired through usual practice can feasibly and adequately serve to guide decisions in the management of THA rehabilitation.","publish_time":"2011-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kirkness, Carmen S.; Fritz, Julie M.","journal":"Health Outcomes Res Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f7b92ece6095d9d1c37751bbb4164d451a49419.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102721.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288908/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187713191100005X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187713191100005X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehrm.2011.04.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["THA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["postoperative THA patients","lower functional status","PT visit","postoperative THA recovery","study of usual physical therapy practice","usual practice","post-THA women","outpatient PT","weeks postsurgery","management of THA rehabilitation","early start patients","STUDY DESIGN","pattern of functional change","lower-functioning women","predicted levels of functional status","Lower Extremity Function Scale","clinical practice","Modeling change","time","years","PURPOSE","electronic medical record PT database","usual care setting","New findings","mean age","effect of sex","total hip arthroplasty","curvilinear slopes of recovery","Hierarchical linear modeling","potential prognostic factors","outcomes measures","controlled studies","growth curves","individual variations","sexes","females","LEFS","SD","decisions","Adults","CONCLUSIONS","predictors","treatment","RESULTS","majority"],"language":"en"},

This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for SARS-CoV-2. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease.

We have evaluated these infections in children with humoral immunodeficiencies who required immunoglobulin replacement therapy, considering their relationship with symptoms, lung function, bacterial co\u2010infection, and outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a prospective case\u2010control study during a 1\u2010year period, including children with humoral immunodeficiencies receiving immunoglobulin replacement therapy. For each patient, at least one healthy family member was included. Respiratory samples for viral detection were taken every 1\u20103 months, and in case of respiratory tract infections. Symptoms questionnaires were filled biweekly. Spirometry and sputum culture were performed in every episode. RESULTS: Sixty\u2010six episodes were analyzed in 14 patients (median age 12 years; IQR 7\u201017), identifying 18 respiratory viruses (27.3%), being rhinovirus the most frequently isolated one (12/18; 66%). Positive viral episodes were associated with clinical symptoms (89% vs 43%), more frequent antibiotic treatment (44% vs 15%) or hospital admission (22% vs 0%) than negative ones. Patients with positive viral detection showed impaired lung function, with lower FEV1 and FVC values. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, viral respiratory tract infections can cause significant respiratory symptoms and impaired lung function, in children with HID, despite immunoglobulin replacement therapy. These patients could benefit from the monitoring of viral infections, as these may be a gateway for ongoing lung damage.","publish_time":"2018-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benavides\u2010Nieto, Marta; M\u00E9ndez\u2010Echevarr\u00EDa, Ana; del Rosal, Teresa; Garc\u00EDa\u2010Garc\u00EDa, Mar\u00EDa Luz; Casas, Inmaculada; Pozo, Francisco; de la Serna, Olga; Lopez\u2010Granados, Eduardo; Rodriguez\u2010Pena, Rebeca; Calvo, Cristina","journal":"Pediatr Pulmonol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a7877fcc08e505d097187cb928a649d8ae5d994.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167964.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.24214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30575324/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FVC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral respiratory tract infections","children","case of respiratory tract infections","respiratory viruses","significant respiratory symptoms","monitoring of viral infections","Respiratory samples","impaired lung function","humoral immunodeficiencies","immunoglobulin replacement therapy","positive viral detection","vs","Positive viral episodes","patients","clinical symptoms","Symptoms questionnaires","ongoing lung damage","prospective case","role of viruses","lower FEV1","relationship","bacterial co\u2010infection","year period","experience","control study","median age","years","FVC values","frequent antibiotic treatment","sputum culture","healthy family member","IQR","outcomes","gateway","hospital admission","Spirometry","METHODS","BACKGROUND","negative ones","CONCLUSIONS","months","rhinovirus","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Failures of hospital IPC in recent years have led to nosocomial and community outbreaks of emerging infections, causing preventable deaths and social disruption. Therefore, effective IPC programs are essential, but can be difficult to sustain in busy clinical environments. Healthcare workers\u2019 adherence to routine IPC practices is often suboptimal, but there is evidence that doctors, as a group, are consistently less compliant than nurses. This is significant because doctors\u2019 behaviours disproportionately influence those of other staff and their peripatetic practice provides more opportunities for pathogen transmission. A better understanding of what drives doctors\u2019 IPC practices will contribute to development of new strategies to improve IPC, overall. METHODS: This qualitative case study involved in-depth interviews with senior clinicians and clinician-managers/directors (16 doctors and 10 nurses) from a broad range of specialties, in a large Australian tertiary hospital, to explore their perceptions of professional and cultural factors that influence doctors\u2019 IPC practices, using thematic analysis of data. RESULTS: Professional/clinical autonomy; leadership and role modelling; uncertainty about the importance of HAIs and doctors\u2019 responsibilities for preventing them; and lack of clarity about senior consultants\u2019 obligations emerged as major themes. Participants described marked variation in practices between individual doctors, influenced by, inter alia, doctors\u2019 own assessment of patients\u2019 infection risk and their beliefs about the efficacy of IPC policies. Participants believed that most doctors recognise the significance of HAIs and choose to [mostly] observe organisational IPC policies, but a minority show apparent contempt for accepted rules, disrespect for colleagues who adhere to, or are expected to enforce, them and indifference to patients whose care is compromised. CONCLUSIONS: Failure of healthcare and professional organisations to address doctors\u2019 poor IPC practices and unprofessional behaviour, more generally, threatens patient safety and staff morale and undermines efforts to minimise the risks of dangerous nosocomial infection.","publish_time":"2019-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gilbert, Gwendolyn L.; Kerridge, Ian","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f91df0d67f4d6fc329815c233f76b5ef0dd3876a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6444390.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940153/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4044-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPC","Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["doctors\u2019 IPC practices","doctors\u2019 poor IPC practices","routine IPC practices","Failures of hospital IPC","efficacy of IPC policies","effective IPC programs","organisational IPC policies","doctors\u2019 responsibilities","doctors\u2019 behaviours","Hospital infection prevention","individual doctors","rates of preventable healthcare-associated infection","professional organisations","perceptions of professional","Failure of healthcare","risks of dangerous nosocomial infection","nurses","Participants","assessment of patients\u2019 infection risk","Healthcare workers\u2019 adherence","senior clinicians","preventable deaths","clinical autonomy","large Australian tertiary hospital","importance of HAIs","staff morale","significance of HAIs","senior consultants\u2019 obligations","busy clinical environments","in-depth interviews","minority","accepted rules","qualitative case study","role modelling","leadership","beliefs","control","community outbreaks of emerging infections","cultural factors","apparent contempt","clinician-managers","recent years","unprofessional behaviour","disrespect","efforts","uncertainty","directors","marked variation","acquisition of multidrug resistant organisms","peripatetic practice","lack of clarity","thematic analysis of data","development of new strategies","opportunities","broad range of specialties","patient safety","major themes","BACKGROUND","pathogen transmission","social disruption","commonest adverse effects of hospitalisation","better understanding","colleagues","METHODS","group","evidence","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","indifference"],"language":"en"},

The elderly display an increased susceptibility and severity to this infection. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the initiators and regulators of immune responses. Therefore, we investigated the role of DCs in the age-associated increased CPn infection in vitro in humans. Though the expression of activation markers was comparable between the two age groups, DCs from aged subjects secreted enhanced levels of proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03B1 and CXCL-10 in response to CPn. In contrast, the secretion of IL-10 and innate interferons, IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03BB, was severely impaired in DCs from aged donors. The increased activation of DCs from aged subjects to CPn also resulted in enhanced proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells in a DC-T coculture. Furthermore, T cells primed with CPn-stimulated DCs from aged subjects secreted increased levels of IFN-\u03B3 and reduced levels of IL-10 compared to DCs obtained from young subjects. In summary, DCs from the elderly displayed enhanced inflammatory response to CPn which may result in airway remodeling and increase the susceptibility of the elderly to respiratory diseases such as asthma.","publish_time":"2014-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prakash, Sangeetha; Agrawal, Sudhanshu; Ma, Dandan; Gupta, Sudhir; Peterson, Ellena M.; Agrawal, Anshu","journal":"Mediators Inflamm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7bb5432ed9fc93c11b893bd499bb66becfc71f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4165882.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/436438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25253920/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CPn-stimulated DCs","increased activation of DCs","role of DCs","increased CPn infection","aged subjects","increased levels of IFN","increased susceptibility","elderly","IFN-\u03B1","aged donors","young subjects","CD8 T cells","enhanced levels of proinflammatory mediators","IFN-\u03BB","reduced levels of IL","enhanced inflammatory response","Dendritic cells","persistent airway infection","enhanced proliferation of CD4","DC-T coculture","age groups","TNF-\u03B1","respiratory diseases","secretion of IL","airway remodeling","common respiratory pathogen","expression of activation markers","initiators","innate interferons","CXCL","severity","regulators of immune responses","asthma","humans","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","contrast","summary","underlying mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 virus at the origin of the current COVID-19 pandemic is causing acute respiratory disorders that may lead to hospitalization, mainly in the elderly. The case presented is that of an old age patient with severe lung disease. Daily motor assessments over 1 week included Timed up and go test, the Five sit-to-stand test, the grip test and the collection of cardiorespiratory constants (heart rate, respiratory rate and 02 saturation). A cognitive and quality of life assessments were performed. Between the initial and final evaluation, the time taken to complete the Timed Up and Go decreased by 4.9 sec, the performance at the five sit-to-stand remained relatively stable, in a context of oxygen withdrawal, maintenance of saturation and an increase in respiratory rate. Despite a poor prognosis, the patient\u0027s respiratory improvement was accompanied by functional motor improvements. The relationship between motor and cardiorespiratory regulation is discussed.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barassin, Leo; Gabali, Elodie; Jammes, Barbara; Renault, Julie; Bekhtaoui, Mohamed; Bonnyaud, Celine","journal":"Kin\u00E9sith\u00E9rapie, la Revue","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1779012320301820?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kine.2020.05.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1779012320301820","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Despite"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the collection","the grip test","the performance at the five sit","the time taken to complete the Timed","the current COVID","Between the initial","Abstract The SARS","to-stand test","The relationship between motor","mainly in the elderly","virus at the origin","test Timed","test Five sit","The case presented is that","the patient\u0027s respiratory improvement was accompanied","test de force","to-stand remained relatively stable","an increase in respiratory rate","maintien de la saturation","pandemic is causing acute respiratory disorders that may lead to hospitalization","heart rate","week included Timed","am\u00E9lioration respiratoire","augmentation de la fr\u00E9quence respiratoire","oxyg\u00E8ne","\u00E9valuation cognitive","cardiorespiratory regulation is discussed","Daily motor assessments over","functional motor improvements","am\u00E9liorations motrices fonctionnelles","\u00E9valuations motrices quotidiennes","relations de r\u00E9gulations motrices","troubles respiratoires aigus","cardiorespiratory constants","virus SRAS","fr\u00E9quence cardiaque","\u00E9valuation initiale","patiente de grand \u00E2ge","assessments were performed","an old age patient with severe lung disease","final evaluation","maintenance","poor prognosis","oxygen withdrawal","decreased","sec","recueil des constantes","serrage maximal","semaine","atteinte pulmonaire s\u00E9v\u00E8re","quality","contexte de sevrage","dur\u00E9e de r\u00E9alisation","Despite","qualit\u00E9 de vie","origine de la pand\u00E9mie actuelle","hospitalisation","pronostic p\u00E9joratif","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","personnes \u00E2g\u00E9es","cas pr\u00E9sent\u00E9"],"language":"fr"},

The subtype H5N1 avian influenza occurs primarily in birds and infection varies from mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal, rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza). It is extremely rare for cats to be infected and there are only very few confirmed reports of the disease in cats in Europe. Infection Cats can be infected via the respiratory and oral routes (eg, by eating infected birds). The key precondition for infection is that the cat lives in an area where H5N1 virus infection has been confirmed in birds. Additionally, the cat should have had outdoor access to an environment where waterfowl is present, or contact with poultry or uncooked poultry meat, or close contact with an H5N1-infected, sick cat during the first week of infection. Clinical suspicion Clinical signs in cats may include fever, lethargy, dyspnoea, conjunctivitis and rapid death. Neurological signs (circling, ataxia) have also been recorded. Diagnosis The veterinary authorities should be notified. Oropharyngeal, nasal and/or rectal swabs or faecal samples of suspected cases should be submitted for PCR and/or virus isolation. Post-mortem samples of lung and mediastinal lymph nodes should be obtained. Particular care should be taken when handling the cat and/or samples. Disease management The virus is sensitive to all standard medical disinfectants. Cats with suspected H5N1 infection should be kept in strict isolation. Owners should be advised to confine the cat to a separate room prior to bringing it to the veterinary clinic. Vaccination and disease prevention No H5N1 vaccines are commercially available for cats. In the event of confirmed cases of H5N1 avian influenza in birds in the area, owners should keep their cats indoors until further information is available, and follow official regulations.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thiry, Etienne; Addie, Diane; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Hosie, Margaret J.; Lloret, Albert; Lutz, Hans; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D.; Truyen, Uwe; Horzinek, Marian C.","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5c85f1a9c124ebc2685cfca8acaa66b97c1869b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X09001235; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X09001235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481042/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["Infection Cats","H5N1 virus infection","H5N1-infected","disease of birds","suspected H5N1 infection","influenza virus","infected birds","subtype H5N1 avian influenza","H5N1 vaccines","event of confirmed cases of H5N1 avian influenza","week of infection","pathogenic avian influenza","Overview Avian influenza","disease prevention","mild disease","Disease management","cat lives","sick cat","virus isolation","area","faecal samples of suspected cases","confirmed reports","Owners","Clinical suspicion Clinical signs","Post-mortem samples of lung","close contact","Neurological signs","strict isolation","veterinary authorities","veterinary clinic","uncooked poultry meat","rectal swabs","fever","dyspnoea","conjunctivitis","lethargy","mediastinal lymph nodes","environment","waterfowl","outdoor access","mortality","epidemic","Vaccination","PCR","standard medical disinfectants","rapid death","circling","ataxia","information","oral routes","official regulations","separate room","key precondition","Diagnosis","Europe","Particular care"],"language":"en"},

An option to increase ventilation capacities not only for COVID-19, but for all patients requiring mechanical ventilation is to use home respirators. Home respirators are turbine respirators, so they can usually be operated without high-pressure oxygen connections and can therefore also be used in areas outside the classical intensive care medical infrastructure. Due to their limited technical features, home respirators are not suitable for the treatment of severely affected patients but can be used for weaning after respiratory improvement, which means that intensive care respirators are available again more quickly. Respiratory therapists are specially trained nurses or therapists in the field of out of hospital ventilation and can independently use home ventilation respirators, for example for weaning in the intensive care unit. Thus, they relieve intensive care nursing staff in the pandemic.

The collection of clones in such a random panel is contrasted with minimal panels suggested by algebraic coding theory. To approximate minimal panels we suggest the method of simulated annealing for selecting small, informative panels from larger existing collections of clones.

It is estimated that the conventional drug discovery process ending with a new medicine ready for the market can take up to 15 years and more than a billion USD.

Many novel technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process, and computational methodologies have become a crucial component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead optimization, techniques such as ligand- or structure-based virtual screening are widely used in many discovery efforts. It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have had a major impact over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer. In this paper, we review the concept of rational design presenting some of the most representative examples of molecules identified by means of it.

Methods: In total, 300 nurses from three of 15 isolation hospitals in South Korea were invited to participate. We collected data pertaining to PTSD, turnover intention, supervisor support, work-related factors, and socio-demographic factors through a structured survey distributed to the nurses at the hospitals after the outbreak. For the statistical analyses, descriptive statistics and multiple regression were employed. Findings: Of the 147 participants, 33.3% were involved in the direct care of the infected patients, whereas 66.7% were involved in the direct care of the suspected patients. More than half (57.1%) of the nurses experienced PTSD, with 25.1% experienced full PTSD and 32.0% with moderate or some level of PTSD. The mean score of turnover intention was 16.3, with the score range of 4 to 20. The multiple regression analysis revealed that PTSD was positively associated with turnover intention, and supervisor support had a strong buffering effect. Conclusion/Application to Practice: These findings confirmed that after a fatal infectious disease outbreak like MERS, nurses experience high level of PTSD and show high intention to leave. Organizational strategies to help nurses to cope with stress and to prevent turnover intention, especially using supervisor support, would be beneficial.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Heeja; Jung, Sun Young; Lee, Mi Hyang; Kim, Mi Sun","journal":"Workplace Health Saf","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e8e1d1581395dcdd9af32908e402a6e9e082044.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201205.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2165079919897693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32146875/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTSD"],"locations":["South Korea","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["nurses experienced PTSD","high intention","high level of PTSD","mean score of turnover intention","nurses post-MERS outbreak","buffering effect of supervisor support","infected patients","South Korea","direct care","suspected patients","Findings","level of post-traumatic stress disorder","fatal infectious disease outbreak","strong buffering effect","multiple regression analysis","work-related factors","isolation hospitals","score range","socio-demographic factors","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","descriptive statistics","statistical analyses","relationship","structured survey","data pertaining","Application","Practice","Background","study","Conclusion","Methods","total","Organizational strategies","deaths","time","participants","half"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory syncytial virus (83%) and human rhinovirus (34%) were most commonly detected. Seven other viruses were present in 8%\u201315% of the patients. Two or more viruses (maximum, 7) were detected in 61% of the infants. Virus type or coinfection was not associated with disease severity. A high genomic load of respiratory syncytial virus was associated with a longer length of stay and with an increased frequency of oxygen and ventilatory support use. Treatment effect of inhaled adrenaline was not modified by virus type, load or coinfection. Discussion. In infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis, disease severity was not associated with specific viruses or the total number of viruses detected. A high RSV genomic load was associated with more-severe disease. Clinical Trials Registration.

The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of HBoV, and other respiratory viral pathogens, in a 2\u2010year retrospective study of children admitted to hospital, and to investigate whether viral loads of HBoV DNA were associated with severity of infection. Between April 2007 and March 2009, 891 respiratory samples from 760 children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infection were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses by real\u2010time PCR or direct immunofluorescence testing. HBoV DNA was detected by using internally controlled real\u2010time quantitative PCR assay and 25 samples selected at random were sequenced. The virus detected most frequently was rhinovirus, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, HBoV, and human metapneumovirus. HBoV DNA was detected in 18.4% of children admitted to hospital. HBoV was the only viral pathogen detected in 66/164 (40.2%) of HBoV DNA\u2010positive children and in 7.4% of all 891 samples. Ninety\u2010seven percent (64/66) of children with an HBoV single infection were diagnosed as having lower respiratory tract infection. Median HBoV DNA viral load was significantly higher in children when HBoV was detected as a single pathogen. Higher HBoV DNA viral loads were associated with prematurity and age. HBoV seems to be an important and frequent pathogen in respiratory tract infections in children, and it is likely that the severity of illness is comparable to the severity of RSV illness. J. Med.

WNV infection of neurons is rapidly progressive and destructive whereas infection of non-neuronal brain cells is limited. However, the role of neurons and pathological consequences of pro-inflammatory cytokines released as a result of WNV infection is unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the role of key cytokines secreted by WNV-infected neurons in mediating neuroinflammatory markers and neuronal death. METHODS: A transformed human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH, was infected with WNV at multiplicity of infection (MOI)-1 and -5, and WNV replication kinetics and expression profile of key pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by plaque assay, qRT-PCR, and ELISA. Cell death was measured in SK-N-SH cell line in the presence and absence of neutralizing antibodies against key pro-inflammatory cytokines using cell viability assay, TUNEL and flow cytometry. Further, na\u00EFve primary astrocytes were treated with UV-inactivated supernatant from mock- and WNV-infected SK-N-SH cell line and the activation of astrocytes was measured using flow cytometry and ELISA. RESULTS: WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells induced the expression of IL-1\u03B2, -6, -8, and TNF-\u03B1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which coincided with increase in virus-induced cell death. Treatment of cells with anti-IL-1\u03B2 or -TNF-\u03B1 resulted in significant reduction of the neurotoxic effects of WNV. Furthermore treatment of na\u00EFve astrocytes with UV-inactivated supernatant from WNV-infected SK-N-SH cell line increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and key inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: Our results for the first time suggest that neurons are one of the potential sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines in WNV-infected brain and these neuron-derived cytokines contribute to WNV-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, cytokines released from neurons also mediate the activation of astrocytes. Our data define specific role(s) of WNV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and provide a framework for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs as much-needed therapeutic interventions to limit symptoms associated with WNVE.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Mukesh; Verma, Saguna; Nerurkar, Vivek R","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e6797f37268c2339ab73addc0e9ef77efd3c557.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2984415.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21034511/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-7-73","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNVE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WNV-infected neurons","WNV infection of neurons","WNV-infected SK-N","WNV-infected brain","key inflammatory cytokines","result of WNV infection","WNV-induced neurotoxicity","role of key cytokines","WNV-associated encephalitis","expression profile of key pro-inflammatory cytokines","WNV replication kinetics","neurotoxic effects of WNV","pathological consequences of pro-inflammatory cytokines","potential sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines","SH cells","role of neurons","virus-induced cell death","neuron-derived cytokines","activation of astrocytes","increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators","cell viability assay","glial cells activation","Treatment of cells","SH cell line increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein","transformed human neuroblastoma cell line","eventual loss of neurons","treatment of na\u00EFve astrocytes","infection of non-neuronal brain cells","expression of IL","neuronal death","multiplicity of infection","na\u00EFve primary astrocytes","UV-inactivated supernatant","flow cytometry","specific role","TNF-\u03B1","WNVE","RESULTS","ELISA","plaque assay","anti-IL","time-dependent manner","absence of neutralizing antibodies","mediating neuroinflammatory markers","presence","framework","TUNEL","mock","significant reduction","dose","development of anti-inflammatory drugs","therapeutic interventions","qRT-PCR","METHODS","symptoms","data","BACKGROUND","MOI","study","objective","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This disease is probably underdiagnosed and is often undertreated. Vague, persistent respiratory symptoms, especially chronic cough, may often be due to asthma. Chronic bronchitis is extremely rare in the pediatric patient and is a manifestation of reactive airway disease or cystic fibrosis. The absolute severity, the extent of the disease, responses to treatment, and long-term course should be evaluated by repeated pulmonary function tests. Fortunately, asthma responds well to pharmacologic and supportive therapy, and it is important to approach its management as that of a chronic rather than episodic illness. Therapy should include comprehensive, closely supervised drug therapy, health education, and a program of selfmanagement. Asthma usually starts before youngsters enter school, and the majority get better as they get older. Nevertheless, many children with moderate or severe asthma will continue to be troubled by intermittent or chronic airway obstruction into adulthood, and they require long-term, anticipatory treatment programs. Comprehensive care will optimize the quality of life for the affected children and their families, and it will minimize the discomfort and restrictions to which some of them have been subjected unnecessarily. Asthma in childhood, especially when not well controlled, may constitute a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adulthood; however, this is as yet only suspected and not proved.(47)","publish_time":"2016-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cropp, Gerd J.A.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094267.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Comprehensive"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe asthma","chronic cough","Chronic bronchitis","chronic airway obstruction","development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","manifestation of reactive airway disease","adulthood","supportive therapy","affected children","supervised drug therapy","long-term course","Comprehensive care","anticipatory treatment programs","repeated pulmonary function tests","health education","persistent respiratory symptoms","responses","quality of life","risk factor","cystic fibrosis","majority","pediatric patient","extent","school","special features","youngsters","program of selfmanagement","absolute severity","consideration","families","episodic illness","childhood","discomfort","restrictions"],"language":"en"},

Factors underpinning the increased mobility of the nursing workforce and their contribution to nurses\u2019 turnover thus merit attention. Understanding nurses\u2019 job satisfaction is important, as this is a key factor in nurses\u2019 turnover. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore nurses\u2019 views and experience regarding different components of their working lives in Mainland China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was selected and 512 nurses working in the medical and surgical departments in two teaching hospitals in Beijing completed questionnaires yielding a response rate of 81%. RESULTS: More than half of nurses (53.7%; n=275) were satisfied or very satisfied with their jobs and 15% (n=77) felt moderate to extreme occupational stress. The majority of the sample reported a high level of organizational commitment (63.7%; n=326) and professional commitment (85.9%; n=440) and only 5.9% (n=30) and 10.0% (n=51), respectively reported role conflict and role ambiguity often or very often. Nurses with a diploma or associate degree reported greater professional commitment and a lower level of role conflict than those with a bachelor degree (p\u003C0.05), but there were no significant differences in job satisfaction, organizational commitment, occupational stress and role ambiguity by educational programme (p\u003E0.05).

However, it can be identified by objective (test scores) or subjective evidence (clinical judgment, patient observation, family interaction).","publish_time":"2004-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gordon, Sharon M.; Jackson, James C.; Ely, E.

The evaluation of organ severity is difficult in patients considered for cannulation in a distant hospital. This study was designed to identify early factors associated with hospital mortality in ARDS patients treated with ECMO and retrieved from referring hospitals. METHODS: Data from 85 consecutive ARDS patients equipped with ECMO by our mobile team and consequently admitted to our ICU were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The main ARDS etiologies were community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (35 %), influenza pneumonia (23 %) (with 12 patients having been treated during the first half of the study period), and nosocomial pneumonia (14 %). The median (interquartile range) time between contact from the referring hospital and patient cannulation was 3 (1\u20134) h. ECMO was venovenous in 77 (91 %) patients. No complications occurred during transport by our mobile unit. Forty-eight patients died at the hospital (56 %). Based on a multivariate logistic regression, a score including age, SOFA score, and a diagnosis of influenza pneumonia was constructed. The probability of hospital mortality following ECMO initiation was 40 % in the 0\u20132 score class (n = 58) and 93 % in the 3\u20134 score class (n = 27). Patients with an influenza pneumonia diagnosis and a SOFA score before ECMO of less than 12 had a mortality rate of 22 %. CONCLUSIONS: Age, SOFA score, and a diagnosis of influenza may be used to accurately evaluate the risk of death in ARDS patients considered for retrieval under ECMO from distant hospitals.","publish_time":"2013-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roch, Antoine; Hraiech, Sami; Masson, Elodie; Grisoli, Dominique; Forel, Jean-Marie; Boucekine, Mohamed; Morera, Pierre; Guervilly, Christophe; Adda, M\u00E9lanie; Dizier, St\u00E9phanie; Toesca, Richard; Collart, Fr\u00E9deric; Papazian, Laurent","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35da72e6acf106a955bb9b44f6dbe2628af60d1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095017.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095017/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzUzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO","ARDS","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["consecutive ARDS patients","SOFA score","ECMO initiation","score class","influenza pneumonia diagnosis","diagnosis of influenza pneumonia","referring hospital","probability of hospital mortality","bacterial pneumonia","nosocomial pneumonia","main ARDS etiologies","age","mortality rate","distant hospitals","patient cannulation","study period","mobile team","mobile unit","candidates","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","time","contact","retrieval","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","community","early factors","interquartile range","therapy","PURPOSE","Data","evaluation of organ severity","multivariate logistic regression","risk of death","median","transport","RESULTS","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","complications","half","ICU"],"language":"en"},

Even if there are more recent reports suggesting that CMV may worsen the outcomes for ICU patients, there is no definite answer to this question: is CMV a potential pathogen for ICU patients or is it simply a bystander? METHODS: We will describe the pathophysiology of active CMV infection and the most recent insights concerning the epidemiological aspects of these reactivations. MAJOR FINDINGS: Cytomegalovirus can be pathogenic by a direct organ insult (such as for the lung), by decreasing host defences against other microorganisms and/or by enhancing the body\u2019s inflammatory response (as in acute respiratory distress syndrome). The incidence of active CMV infection is dependent on the diagnostic method used. Using the most sophisticated available biological tools, the incidence can reach 15\u201320 % of ICU patients (20\u201340 % in ICU patients with positive CMV serology). In adequately powered cohorts of patients, active CMV infection appears to be associated with worse outcomes for mechanically ventilated ICU patients. DISCUSSION: There is no absolute direct proof of a negative impact of active CMV infection on the health outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients. Prospective randomized trials are lacking. Future trials should examine the potential benefits for health outcomes of using antiviral treatments. Such treatments could be prophylactic, pre-emptive or used only when there is an end-organ disease. CONCLUSION: Cytomegalovirus infection may affect health outcomes for ICU patients. Additional prospective trials are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papazian, Laurent; Hraiech, Sami; Lehingue, Samuel; Roch, Antoine; Chiche, Laurent; Wiramus, Sandrine; Forel, Jean-Marie","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c726bd8990c1ef671ee43b9dec20e765ab2589d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095171.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095171/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzU4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","CMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ventilated ICU patients","ventilated patients","incidence of active CMV infection","pathophysiology of active CMV infection","non-immunocompromised ICU patients","Cytomegalovirus infection","health outcomes","negative impact of active CMV infection","powered cohorts of patients","positive CMV serology","worse outcomes","proven cytomegalovirus","Future trials","Additional prospective trials","Prospective randomized trials","direct organ insult","potential benefits","potential pathogen","recent insights","recent reports","antiviral treatments","absolute direct proof","end-organ disease","pneumonia","question","acute respiratory distress syndrome","body\u2019s inflammatory response","sophisticated available biological tools","epidemiological aspects","definite answer","diagnostic method","host defences","lung","MAJOR FINDINGS","results","CONCLUSION","microorganisms","reactivations","DISCUSSION","hypothesis","INTRODUCTION","years","METHODS","bystander"],"language":"en"},

Pediatric candidates for ITx often suffer from severe multisystem impairments that pose challenges to the medical team. These patients frequently require intensive care preoperatively and have unique intensive care needs postoperatively. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on intensive care of pediatric intestinal transplantation as well as our own experience. This review is not aimed only at pediatric intensivists from ITx centers; these patients frequently require ICU care at other institutions. RESULTS: Preoperative management focuses on optimization of organ function, minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury, preventing excessive edema yet maintaining adequate organ perfusion, preventing and controlling sepsis and bleeding from varices at enterocutaneous interfaces, and optimizing nutritional support. The goal is to extend life in stable condition to the point of transplantation. Postoperative care focuses on optimizing perfusion of the mesenteric circulation by maintaining intravascular volume, minimizing hypercoagulability, and providing adequate oxygen delivery. Careful monitoring of the stoma and its output and correction of electrolyte imbalances that may require renal replacement therapy is critical, as are monitoring for and aggressively treating infections, which often present with only subtle clinical clues. Signs of intestinal rejection may be non-specific, and early differentiation from other causes of intestinal dysfunction is important. Understanding of the expanding armamentarium of immunosuppressive agents and their side-effects is required. CONCLUSIONS: As outcomes of ITx improve, transplant teams accept patients with higher pre-operative morbidity and at higher risk for complications. Many ITx patients would benefit from earlier referral for transplant evaluation before severe liver disease, recurrent central venous catheter-related sepsis and venous thromboses develop.","publish_time":"2008-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hauser, Gabriel J.; Kaufman, Stuart S.; Matsumoto, Cal S.; Fishbein, Thomas M.","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ebb118e38910260541ed315b9f90ab549d79f5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095271.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095271/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzYxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ITx patients","intensive care of pediatric intestinal transplantation","ICU care","Postoperative care","unique intensive care","ITx centers","outcomes of ITx","mainstream of medical care","multivisceral transplantation","point of transplantation","causes of intestinal dysfunction","adequate organ perfusion","Signs of intestinal rejection","pediatric intensivists","Pediatric candidates","transplant evaluation","transplant teams","higher risk","medical team","Careful monitoring","severe liver disease","recurrent central venous catheter-related sepsis","optimization of organ function","severe multisystem impairments","adequate oxygen delivery","higher pre-operative morbidity","excessive edema","earlier referral","ventilator-induced lung injury","enterocutaneous interfaces","increasing survival rates","correction of electrolyte imbalances","hypercoagulability","output","early differentiation","challenges","renal replacement therapy","literature","Preoperative management","stable condition","life","intravascular volume","stoma","mesenteric circulation","bleeding","varices","expanding armamentarium of immunosuppressive agents","subtle clinical clues","side-effects","nutritional support","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","complications","goal","CONCLUSIONS","institutions","infections","METHODS","review","experience"],"language":"en"},

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are neutrophil-derived structures composed of DNA decorated with antimicrobial peptides. They have been shown to trap and kill microorganisms, playing a critical role in host defense. However, their contribution to tumor development and metastasis has recently been demonstrated in a number of studies highlighting NETs as a potentially important therapeutic target.

However, it is unknown whether increased TIPE2 is protective against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether increased TIPE2 can exert protective effects in a mouse model of ALI induced by LPS. METHODS: We administered TIPE2 adeno-associated virus (AAV-TIPE2) intratracheally into the lungs of mice. Three weeks later, ALI was induced by intratracheal injection of LPS into BALB/c mice. Twenty-four hours later, lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was acquired to analyse cells and protein, arterial blood was collected for arterial blood gas analysis and the determination of pro-inflammatory factor levels, and lung issues were collected for histologic examination, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), TUNEL staining, wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio analysis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity analysis and blot analysis of protein expression. RESULTS: We found that TIPE2 overexpression markedly mitigated LPS-induced lung injury, which was evaluated by the deterioration of histopathology, histologic scores, the W/D weight ratio, and total protein expression in the BALF. Moreover, TIPE2 overexpression markedly attenuated lung inflammation, as evidenced by the downregulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in the BALF, lung MPO activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum. Moreover, TIPE2 overexpression not only dramatically prevented LPS-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in mice but also blocked LPS-activated JNK phosphorylation and NF-\u03BAB p65 nuclear translocation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the increased expression of AAV-mediated TIPE2 in the lungs of mice inhibits acute inflammation and apoptosis and suppresses the activation of NF-\u03BAB and JNK in a murine model of ALI.","publish_time":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Xiaojing; Kong, Qian; Zhan, Liying; Qiu, Zhen; Huang, Qin; Song, Xuemin","journal":"Inflamm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38fc059cf1b8080dbd55cd5cb80f7c98e06213ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096061.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096061/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozc5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["BALF","JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased TIPE2","TIPE2 overexpression","AAV-TIPE2","mediated TIPE2","induced protein","induced ALI","mitigated LPS-induced lung injury","activity analysis","lung MPO activity","lung issues","blot analysis of protein expression","TIPE2 adeno-associated virus","BALF","lungs of mice","weight ratio analysis","attenuated lung inflammation","intratracheal injection of LPS","total protein expression","increased expression of AAV","LPS-activated JNK phosphorylation","c mice","mouse model of ALI","murine model of ALI","arterial blood gas analysis","D weight ratio","lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","determination of pro-inflammatory factor levels","pro-inflammatory cytokine levels","histologic examination","histologic scores","activation of NF","protective effects","acute inflammation","current study","NF-\u03BAB p65 nuclear translocation","pulmonary cell apoptosis","Tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1","TEM","myeloperoxidase","TUNEL staining","transmission electron microscopy","lipopolysaccharide","PMNs","BALB","OBJECTIVE","hours","serum","cells","downregulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils","deterioration of histopathology","strong anti-inflammatory properties","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report strong association between a promoter variant of CD209, DCSIGN1-336, and risk of dengue fever compared with dengue hemorrhagic fever or population controls. The G allele of the variant DCSIGN1-336 was associated with strong protection against dengue fever in three independent cohorts from Thailand, with a carrier frequency of 4.7% in individuals with dengue fever compared with 22.4% in individuals with dengue hemorrhagic fever (odds ratio for risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever versus dengue fever: 5.84, P = 1.4 \u00D7 10(\u22127)) and 19.5% in controls (odds ratio for protection: 4.90, P = 2 \u00D7 10(\u22126)).

METHODS: Clinical details of 85 children (positive for the 2009 H1N1 virus infection tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay) were analyzed from medical charts. RESULTS: Of the 85 (55 boys) children positive for 2009 H1N1 virus infection, 64.7% were between 5 years to 16 years, and 35.3% were below 5 years age. The mean age of these children was 7.5\u00B13.5 yr. Contact history was positive only in 22 (26%) cases. High grade fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough and rhinorrhea. Twenty-nine (34%) patients had an underlying co-morbid condition. Of the 34 patients who underwent chest radiography during evaluation, 18 children (52.9%) had findings consistent with lower respiratory tract infection. Antiviral therapy was initiated in 76 patients. Hospitalization was required in 30 (35.3%) children.

We administered TIPE2 adeno-associated virus (AAV-TIPE2) intratracheally into the lungs of mice. Control mice were infected with an adeno-associated virus expressing no transgene. Three weeks later, an animal model of caecal ligation-perforation (CLP)-induced sepsis was established. DEX was administered intravenously 30 min after CLP. Twenty-four hours after sepsis, lung injury was assayed by lung histology, the ratio of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to total cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, BALF protein content and the lung wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio. Proinflammatory factor levels in the BALF of mice were measured. The protein expression levels in lung tissues were analysed by Western blotting. The results showed that DEX treatment markedly mitigated sepsis-induced lung injury, which was characterized by the deterioration of histopathology, histologic scores, the W/D weight ratio and total protein levels in the BALF. Moreover, DEX markedly attenuated sepsis-induced lung inflammation, as evidenced by the decrease in the number of PMNs in the BALF, lung MPO activity and proinflammatory cytokines in the BALF. In addition, DEX dramatically prevented sepsis-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in mice, as reflected by decreases in the number of TUNEL-positive cells, the protein expression of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase 3 and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition, evaluation of protein expression showed that DEX blocked sepsis-activated JNK phosphorylation and NF-\u03BAB p65 nuclear translocation. Similar results were also observed in the TIPE2 overexpression group. Our study demonstrated that DEX inhibits acute inflammation and apoptosis in a murine model of sepsis-stimulated ALI via the upregulation of TIPE2 and the suppression of the activation of the NF-\u03BAB and JNK signalling pathways.","publish_time":"2020-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kong, Qian; Wu, Xiaojing; Qiu, Zhen; Huang, Qin; Xia, Zhongyuan; Song, Xuemin","journal":"Inflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57562c66a59f923ca2f601daa637d1b1f9b3b3be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099173.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzkwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["DEX","BALF","Bax/Bcl"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced sepsis","mitigated sepsis-induced lung injury","BALF of mice","attenuated sepsis-induced lung inflammation","lung tissues","lung wet","lung histology","acute lung injury","lung MPO activity","murine model of sepsis","mouse model of sepsis","BALF protein content","DEX treatment","protein expression levels","total protein levels","DEX blocked sepsis-activated JNK phosphorylation","protein expression of cleaved caspase","evaluation of protein expression","upregulation of TIPE2","AAV-TIPE2","TIPE2 adeno-associated virus","D weight ratio","Control mice","lungs of mice","TIPE2 overexpression group","total cells","acute inflammation","ratio of polymorphonuclear leukocytes","Proinflammatory factor levels","number of PMNs","CLP","addition","positive cells","stimulated ALI","proinflammatory cytokines","number of TUNEL","present study","Similar results","NF-\u03BAB p65 nuclear translocation","animal model of caecal ligation-perforation","JNK signalling pathways","pulmonary cell apoptosis","myeloperoxidase","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","histologic scores","suppression","Bax","protective actions of dexmedetomidine","activation","deterioration of histopathology","Western blotting","Bcl","transgene","decrease","hours","aim","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Hence, there is an important role for antiviral therapy in the management of influenza. While amantadine and rimantadine have been available for the treatment of influenza in some countries for several years, they are only effective against influenza A viruses, they can have neurological and gastrointestinal adverse effects, and resistant virus is rapidly generated. Neuraminidase inhibitors, a new class of drug, are potent and specific inhibitors of all strains of influenza virus, and they have minimal adverse effects. The greatest benefit is seen in those patients presenting \u003C30 hours after development of influenza symptoms, those with severe symptoms or those in high-risk groups. In addition to treatment of the infection, both drugs are effective prophylactically and have been shown to limit spread of infection in close communities, such as families and in nursing homes. No resistant virus strains have been isolated from normal individuals treated with zanamivir. Resistant virus can be isolated from approximately 1% of adults and 5% of paediatric patients with influenza treated with oseltamivir. However, infectivity of mutant viruses is generally compromised. Governments spend millions of dollars on influenza vaccination campaigns; however, once influenza virus is circulating in the community, vaccination cannot limit the spread of disease. A greater promotion of the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment and prevention of influenza could have a significant impact on limiting its spread. This could result in saving millions of dollars, not only in direct costs associated with medical and hospital care, but also significant savings in indirect costs associated with the loss of productivity at work, school and home environments. For the benefit of all communities, there needs to be a greater awareness of the symptoms of influenza and the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in disease treatment.","publish_time":"2012-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"McKimm-Breschkin, Jennifer L.","journal":"Treat Respir Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00ae60473d68cce817c03b7e329e0546d99736f2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzkwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of influenza","symptoms of influenza","prevention of influenza","strains of influenza virus","management of influenza","development of influenza symptoms","influenza vaccination campaigns","resistant virus strains","efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors","disease treatment","use of neuraminidase inhibitors","specific inhibitors","spread of infection","spread of disease","severe symptoms","paediatric patients","millions of dollars","poor response of elderly patients","gastrointestinal adverse effects","minimal adverse effects","indirect costs","significant savings","significant impact","poor match","greater promotion","close communities","greater awareness","greatest benefit","infectivity of mutant viruses","hospital care","new class of drug","work","school","loss of productivity","antiviral therapy","primary method","families","vaccine","hours","community","home environments","important role","normal individuals","high-risk groups","rimantadine","years","drugs","oseltamivir","countries","Governments","nursing homes","zanamivir","amantadine","adults","addition"],"language":"en"},

Regardless, for evaluating universal influenza immunization program effectiveness, other established and available measures employed in previous studies describing the epidemiology of influenza should be used instead of laboratory data.","publish_time":"2007-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwong, Jeffrey C.; Stukel, Th\u00E9r\u00E8se A.; McGeer, Allison J.; Manuel, Douglas G.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40e9c784bb8eada7d0fd0438e2945be26c802102.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127273.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X06010759; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06010759","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Universal Influenza Immunization Campaign"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemiology of influenza","levels of influenza activity","presence of influenza activity","proportion of influenza tests positive","Laboratory data","cases of laboratory","universal influenza immunization program effectiveness","effectiveness of Ontario\u0027s Universal Influenza Immunization Campaign","numbers of laboratory","weekly proportion of tests positive","number of tests","better measure of viral activity","marked increase","outcome measure","available measures","Thomson\u0027s evaluation","previous studies","time","Abstract Groll","various biases"],"language":"en"},

Tunicamycin completely inhibited the production of infectious virus particles and significantly reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into viral glycoproteins. In the presence of monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced, which was mainly due to inhibition of virus release, rather than virus production. Monensin only slightly inhibited viral glycoprotein synthesis. The effects of these compounds on infectivity indicated that glycosylation is required for the production of infectious virus, though complete processing of the glycoproteins is not essential. In addition, egress of the virions from infected cells probably requires a functional Golgi complex. In the presence of tunicamycin or monensin various degrees of glycosylation of the major glycoproteins occurred, consequently their rates of migration differed from that of the normal glycoproteins. Tunicamycin completely blocked glycosylation of GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7. In contrast, GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b were partially glycosyaated in the presence of tunicamycin. These results indicated that GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7 are N-linked glycoproteins, but GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b contain both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all viral glycoproteins to the cell surface, suggesting that glycosylation is required for this process. In the presence of monensin, the viral glycoproteins were transported and expressed on the cell surface indicating that transport does not require complete processing of the glycoproteins and may occur via a Golgi-independent pathway. In addition, monensin-treated BHV-1 infected cells could act as target cells in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity assay.

Accounting for behavioural mechanisms that determine uptake of infectious disease interventions such as vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can significantly alter predicted health outcomes in a population. However, most previous approaches that model interactions between human behaviour and disease dynamics have modelled behaviour of these two interventions separately. Here, we develop and analyze an agent based network model to gain insights into how behaviour toward both interventions interact adaptively with disease dynamics (and therefore, indirectly, with one another) during the course of a single epidemic where an SIRV infection spreads through a contact network. In the model, individuals decide to become vaccinated and/or practice NPIs based on perceived infection prevalence (locally or globally) and on what other individuals in the network are doing. We find that introducing adaptive NPI behaviour lowers vaccine uptake on account of behavioural feedbacks, and also decreases epidemic final size. When transmission rates are low, NPIs alone are as effective in reducing epidemic final size as NPIs and vaccination combined. Also, NPIs can compensate for delays in vaccine availability by hindering early disease spread, decreasing epidemic size significantly compared to the case where NPI behaviour does not adapt to mitigate early surges in infection prevalence. We also find that including adaptive NPI behaviour strongly mitigates the vaccine behavioural feedbacks that would otherwise result in higher vaccine uptake at lower vaccine efficacy as predicted by most previous models, and the same feedbacks cause epidemic final size to remain approximately constant across a broad range of values for vaccine efficacy. Finally, when individuals use local information about others\u2019 behaviour and infection prevalence, instead of population-level information, infection is controlled more efficiently through ring vaccination, and this is reflected in the time evolution of pair correlations on the network. This model shows that accounting for both adaptive NPI behaviour and adaptive vaccinating behaviour regarding social effects and infection prevalence can result in qualitatively different predictions than if only one type of adaptive behaviour is modelled.","publish_time":"2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andrews, Michael A.; Bauch, Chris T.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1eb44665543150a4a6b5f2ae166823a07ff52d29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094134.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26829313/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519316000667; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519316000667; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.01.027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adaptive NPI behaviour","others\u2019 behaviour","adaptive vaccinating behaviour","type of adaptive behaviour","epidemic size","disease dynamics","vaccine behavioural feedbacks","epidemic final size","individuals","network model","perceived infection prevalence","vaccine availability","single epidemic","higher vaccine uptake","human behavioural dynamics","uptake of infectious disease interventions","lower vaccine efficacy","early disease spread","practice NPIs","SIRV infection spreads","account of behavioural feedbacks","behavioural mechanisms","contact network","non-pharmaceutical interventions","previous models","ring vaccination","Accounting","population-level information","local information","early surges","previous approaches","Abstract Mathematical models","predicted health outcomes","interplay","social effects","interactions","broad range of values","understanding","insights","delays","time evolution of pair correlations","case","different predictions","transmission rates","agent","diseases","response","course"],"language":"en"},

We report 30 novel irradiation-sensitive ligands, specifically targeting South East Asian populations, which provide 93, 63, and 79% coverage for HLA-A, -B, and -C, respectively. Unique ligands for all 16 HLA types were constructed to provide the desired soluble HLA product in sufficient yield. Peptide exchange was accomplished for all variants as demonstrated by an ELISA-based MHC stability assay. HLA tetramers with redirected specificity could detect antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) T-cell responses against human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B (HBV), dengue virus (DENV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. The potential of this population-centric HLA library was demonstrated with the characterization of seven novel T-cell epitopes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, HBV, and DENV. Posthoc analysis revealed that the majority of responses would be more readily identified by our unbiased discovery approach than through the application of state-of-the-art epitope prediction.

They were adenovirus (4.8%), influenza virus (1.0%), RS virus (6.3%), and human metapneumovirus (2.9%).

In this review, we summarize findings from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) that illustrate examples of host cell miRNAs that target the viruses, of RSS encoded by viruses, and of host cell miRNA profile changes that are seen in infected cells.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Houzet, Laurent; Jeang, Kuan-Teh","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7c1dfa3775544e3204b9df7dce0354c0c91e66a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/65edc5ba685f38ced35386125acf20242ba56300.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3177989.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3177989?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21640212/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2011.05.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874939911000769; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874939911000769","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","RSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viruses","host miRNAs","viral miRNAs","examples of host cell miRNAs","host cell miRNA profile changes","animal cells","mammalian cells","infected cells","viral replication","viral infections","RSS","human T-cell leukemia virus type","human immunodeficiency virus type","cell\u2019s miRNA selection","HIV","small non-coding RNAs","multitude of critical processes","findings","HTLV","RNA silencing suppressors","potency","MicroRNAs","turn","review","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Given the importance of disaster nursing training programmes, understanding how well prepared hospital nurses are to provide disaster care is vital. Objectives This paper analyses the perceived readiness of hospital nurses for a disaster response and the factors influencing their report for work outside the hospital environment. Design A cross-sectional research design was used. Settings This study was conducted at a military hospital in Taiwan. Participants A sample of 311 registered nurses participated in this study. Methods Data were collected on readiness for disaster responses using a 40-item researcher-designed, self-administered questionnaire found to have satisfactory reliability and validity. The questionnaire has four domains: personal preparation (16 items), self-protection (11 items), emergency response (6 items), and clinical management (7 items). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent t-tests and generalised linear models. Results The majority of hospital nurses demonstrated poor readiness for disaster responses. Scores on the four domains were most associated with nurses\u0027 disaster-related training, experience in disaster response and emergency/intensive care experience. Conclusions Our results indicate that disaster-related training should be included in undergraduate programmes and continuing education courses to help hospital nurses recognise and improve their own readiness for disaster responses outside the hospital environment. Future research is needed to improve hospital nurses\u0027 disaster-response readiness in Taiwan and other countries.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tzeng, Wen-Chii; Feng, Hsin-Pei; Cheng, Wei-Tung; Lin, Chia-Huei; Chiang, Li-Chi; Pai, Lu; Lee, Chun-Lan","journal":"Nurse Education Today","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df182a08c29a1a9915773052380b85fa4dbf6a88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131547.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0260691716000976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26970707/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2016.02.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691716000976","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["disaster care","disaster responses","hospital nurses\u0027 disaster-response readiness","disaster areas","hospital environment","mobilising hospital nurses","prepared hospital nurses","majority of hospital nurses","perceived readiness of hospital nurses","military hospital","nurses\u0027 disaster-related training","items","importance of disaster nursing training programmes","registered nurses","emergency response","poor readiness","critical care","intensive care experience","domains","Taiwan","study","results","cross-sectional research design","undergraduate programmes","self-administered questionnaire","Methods Data","Future research","independent t-tests","continuing education courses","descriptive statistics","report","generalised linear models","personal preparation","item researcher","satisfactory reliability","Abstract Background","patients","work","factors","self-protection","paper","pivotal strategy","Objectives","Participants","sample","clinical management","countries","validity","Conclusions","Settings","Scores"],"language":"en"},

Thus, we aimed to explore TCM characteristics of clinical efficacy to NCP, as well as to optimize Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) and the recommended formulas to NCP by National Health Commission (NHC). METHODS: Chinese medical sciences theory and clinical application of TCM were analyzed. A total of 54 NCP patients were observed in a hospital from Wuhan, whose clinical characteristics and utilization of Chinese Medicines (CMs) were described. Paired t test was used to measure the change of patients\u2019 hemogram during hospitalization period, indicating the effect of CMs. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting the length of hospital stay. Network pharmacology analysis was applied to figure out the performance of NHC-recommended formulas of five disease stages at levels of compounds, targets and pathways. RESULT: The average length of hospital stay was 8.96 days. Patients over 45 stayed 9.79 days in hospital in average, longer than 7.64 days of patients under 45. Comparing the hemograms between admission and discharge of hospital, the number of leukocytes, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet increased, while the numbers of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit decreased. According to the standard coefficients of regression, the factor affecting the length of stay for the most was CMs in category of invigorating spleen and removing dampness (ISRD), followed by administrating CMs, male, and cough. Thirty-two CMs were screened after deleting duplication from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas. Compound quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, acacetin etc., were all involved in the treatment of various disease stages on the compound level both in generality and individuality. CONCLUSION: TCM has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution and a positive clinical efficacy on NCP. The CMs of ISRD improved patients\u2019 recovery, suggesting the importance of regulating intestinal function and keeping microenvironmental balance in TCM treatment of NCP. The active compounds from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas contribute to recovery of varied disease progresses during TCM treating NCP.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Erdan; Zhang, Daiyan; Luo, Hua; Liu, Bowen; Zhao, Keming; Zhao, Yonghua; Bian, Ying; Wang, Yitao","journal":"Chin Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c549ead2d70aea91f4f9e88a27c8e637041255d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156896.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-020-00317-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308732/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM","NCP","National Health Commission","ISRD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["TCM treatment of NCP","NCP patients","NHC-recommended formulas","clinical application of TCM","TCM characteristics of clinical efficacy","administrating CMs","effect of CMs","average length of hospital stay","clinical characteristics","QFPDD","discharge of hospital","days of patients","CMs of ISRD improved patients\u2019 recovery","performance of NHC","positive clinical efficacy","recovery of varied disease","treatment of various disease stages","active compounds","Wuhan","utilization of Chinese Medicines","traditional Chinese medicine","novel coronavirus pneumonia","Chinese medical sciences theory","compound level","levels of compounds","Compound quercetin","active role","Multiple linear regression analysis","change of patients\u2019 hemogram","standard coefficients of regression","Network pharmacology analysis","pathological evolution","microenvironmental balance","systemic theoretical understanding","hospitalization period","National Health Commission","importance","number of leukocytes","category of invigorating spleen","intestinal function","hemoglobin concentration","numbers of erythrocytes","platelet","neutrophil","lymphocyte","luteolin","kaempferol","dampness","METHODS","targets","China","duplication","Qingfei Paidu decoction","hematocrit","acacetin","generality","individuality","pathways","hemograms","admission","male","cough","CONCLUSION","factors","RESULT","Paired t test","virus COVID","BACKGROUND","total"],"language":"en"},

This novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood. AIMS: To provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS. SOURCES: The most recent literature in the English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed, and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics. CONTENT: COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%). The possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of COVID-19 it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number (R(0)) of COVID-19 (2.0\u20132.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R(0) of SARS (1.7\u20131.9) and higher than that of MERS (\u003C1). A gastrointestinal route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, which has been assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation. IMPLICATIONS: There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons with which to face this new global threat.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrosillo, N.; Viceconte, G.; Ergonul, O.; Ippolito, G.; Petersen, E.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176926.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32234451/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20301713; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20301713","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","clinical features of COVID","MERS epidemics","severe clinical picture of COVID","severe acute respiratory syndrome","acute respiratory distress syndrome","epidemic features","respiratory illness","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe pneumonia","novel coronavirus disease","new human coronavirus","new global threat","China","pathogenesis","current scientific evidence","epidemiology","peculiar pathogenetic","best cultural weapons","recent literature","Asian countries","capacity","actual basic reproductive number","differences","English language","ARDS","past","gastrointestinal route of transmission","cases","date","concerns mortality","pandemic level","SOURCES","review","fatality rate","BACKGROUND","community","lessons","data","CONTENT","possibility","investigation","IMPLICATIONS"],"language":"en"},

Within the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common nosocomial infection that is frequently caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing challenge in the care of critically ill patients. Escalating rates of antibiotic resistance add substantially to the morbidity, mortality, and cost related to infection in the ICU. Both gram-positive organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus , and gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter species, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae , such as the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase\u2013producing bacteria, and extended spectrum \u03B2-lactamase organisms, have contributed to the escalating rates of resistance seen in VAP and other nosocomial infections. The rising rates of antimicrobial resistance have led to the routine empiric administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics even when bacterial infection is not documented. Moreover, there are several new broader-spectrum antibiotics that have recently become available and others scheduled for approval in the near future. The challenge to ICU clinicians is how to most effectively utilize these agents to maximize patient benefits while minimizing further emergence of resistance. Use of rapid diagnostics may hold the key for achieving this important balance. There is an urgent need for integrating the administration of new and existing antibiotics with the emerging rapid diagnostic technologies in a way that is both cost-effective and sustainable for the long run.","publish_time":"2017-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kollef, Marin H.; Burnham, Carey-Ann D.","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d65558b135961bf2783c01246d9c24e44f8543f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117076.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28578550/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0037-1599224","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["escalating rates of resistance","emergence of resistance","Escalating rates of antibiotic resistance","rising rates of antimicrobial resistance","multidrug-resistant bacteria","existing antibiotics","VAP","gram-negative bacteria","new broader-spectrum antibiotics","administration of new","bacterial infection","common nosocomial infection","ICU clinicians","nosocomial infections","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae","routine empiric administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics","serious infections","growing challenge","gram-positive organisms","rapid diagnostics","ill patients","extended spectrum \u03B2-lactamase organisms","key determinant of outcome","intensive care unit","emerging rapid diagnostic technologies","setting","Acinetobacter species","vancomycin-intermediate","way","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","ventilator-associated pneumonia","Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase","virulence","cost","morbidity","patient benefits","approval","long run","mortality","urgent need","near future","underlying pathogen","agents","important balance"],"language":"en"},

Because of their history of emergence events due to their prevalence in zoonotic pools, designing live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines that can be rapidly and broadly implemented is essential for outbreak preparedness. Here, we show that coronaviruses with completely rewired transcription regulatory networks (TRNs) are effective vaccines against SARS-CoV. The TRN-rewired viruses are attenuated and protect against lethal SARS-CoV challenge. While a 3-nt rewired TRN reverts via second-site mutation upon serial passage, a 7-nt rewired TRN is more stable, suggesting that a more extensively rewired TRN might be essential for avoiding growth selection. In summary, rewiring the TRN is a feasible strategy for limiting reversion in an effective live-attenuated coronavirus vaccine candidate that is potentially portable across the Nidovirales order.","publish_time":"2018-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graham, Rachel L.; Deming, Damon J.; Deming, Meagan E.; Yount, Boyd L.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"Commun Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dadb8cce14cbf09b6fbaf927b0b2524899ac028d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6206136.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30393776/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-018-0175-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TRN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuated vaccines","nt rewired TRN","TRN-rewired viruses","attenuated coronavirus vaccines","effective vaccines","effective live-attenuated coronavirus vaccine candidate","rewired transcription regulatory networks","utility of live","zoonotic pools","risks of reversion","lethal SARS-CoV challenge","zoonotic viral diseases","major threats","global health","TRNs","economic stability","serial passage","site mutation","coronaviral disease burden","prevalence","key","coronaviruses","national security","feasible strategy","history of emergence events","growth selection","Nidovirales order","outbreak preparedness","repair","summary"],"language":"en"},

Our findings suggest that glycyrrhizin should be assessed for treatment of SARS.","publish_time":"2003-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cinatl, J; Morgenstern, B; Bauer, G; Chandra, P; Rabenau, H; Doerr, HW","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a7f3082096005d478c57d5b9f2abf3a2aa3ccc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112442.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067360313615X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S014067360313615X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Frankfurt University"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["treatment of SARS","outbreak of SARS","glycyrrhizin","SARS-associated virus","SARS-associated coronavirus infection","FFM","antiviral compounds","clinical isolates of coronavirus","specific treatment","antiviral potential of ribavirin","clinical centre of Frankfurt University","azauridine","pyrazofurin","inhibiting replication","mycophenolic acid","Germany","search","patients","present","disease","Summary","findings"],"language":"en"},

Abstract The purpose of this article is to describe two paediatric neuro-ophthalmological clinical cases caused by a systemic infection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae). The cases are two girls aged 14 and 12 seen in the Emergency Department: The first one had internuclear ophthalmoplegia and second with loss of vision and headache. They had no other neurological foci. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense plaques in both, suggestive of a demyelinating disease. One month later, the neuro-ophthalmological symptoms resolved, with normal follow-up magnetic resonance imagings. The diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalitis secondary to M. pneumoniae. The diagnosis was made using PCR (gold standard) and/or IgM in serology. It is important to think about this possible aetiology in cases of suggestive demyelinating disease. There is controversy about the role of antibiotics and on whether corticosteroids are contemplated. In conclusion, M. pneumoniae must be a differential diagnosis in acute neuro-ophthalmological disorders in children.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Molero-Senosiain, M.; Domingo-Gordo, B.; Fern\u00E1ndez Cabrera, C.; Hern\u00E1ndez-Garc\u00EDa, E.; G\u00F3mez de Lia\u00F1o, R.","journal":"Arch Soc Esp Oftalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be1c11f12d6cdbcf706c2a722477168b5bc1dfad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115784.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0365669120300368; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0365669120300368; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oftal.2020.01.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Al","M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["El diagn\u00F3stico","the Emergency Department"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["los s\u00EDntomas neuroftalmol\u00F3gicos se resolvieron y","pneumoniae debe ser diagn\u00F3stico diferencial en afectaciones neuroftalmol\u00F3gicas agudas en ni\u00F1os","Se presentan los casos","oftalmoplej\u00EDa internuclear y","los antibi\u00F3ticos y si se contemplan los corticoides","diagn\u00F3stico se hace por PCR","o IgM en serolog\u00EDa","visi\u00F3n y cefalea","objetivo es describir dos cuadros cl\u00EDnicos neuroftalmol\u00F3gicos en ni\u00F1os por infecci\u00F3n sist\u00E9mica por Mycoplasma pneumoniae","neuro-ophthalmological symptoms","resonancia magn\u00E9tica se evidenciaron placas hiperintensas en ambas","acute neuro-ophthalmological disorders","cases of suggestive demyelinating disease","paediatric neuro-ophthalmological clinical cases","gold standard","differential diagnosis","Es importante pensar en esta posible etiolog\u00EDa ante casos sugerentes","dos ni\u00F1as","enfermedad desmielinizante","cuadro desmielinizante","internuclear ophthalmoplegia","normal follow-up magnetic resonance imagings","diagn\u00F3stico fue encefalitis diseminada aguda secundaria","acute disseminated encephalitis secondary","resonancias magn\u00E9ticas","segunda","papel","urgencias","primera","p\u00E9rdida","imagen","a\u00F1os que acudieron","possible aetiology","Al mes","systemic infection","control fueron normales","Resumen","Existe controversia sobre","hyperintense plaques","Como conclusi\u00F3n","children","loss of vision","role of antibiotics","presentaban otra focalidad neurol\u00F3gica","article","controversy","corticosteroids","headache","month","Emergency Department","neurological foci","purpose","serology","girls","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of Kawasaki disease in acute stages in Taiwan, by linking the diagnosis code to medication and comparing the differences in epidemiological features with those of previous reports that used the diagnosis code alone. Methods We searched the National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2010. For the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) set, all inpatients with a main diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (ICD-9, 446.1) were retrieved. For the ICD-9 \u002B intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) set, Kawasaki disease in acute stages was defined as the disease stages requiring IVIG. The epidemiologic features were calculated and compared by both methods. Results The incidence rates for children under 5 years ranged from 21.5 to 68.5 per 100,000 person-years (average 49.1) for the ICD-9 \u002B IVIG set and from 48.5 to 82.8 per 100,000 person-years (average 74.9) for the ICD-9 set. Significant discrepancy in peak season estimation occurred in summer. The 5-year recurrence rate was 1.1% for the ICD-9 \u002B IVIG set and 4.5% for the ICD-9 set. The coronary complication rates were around 7.24% (ICD-9 \u002B IVIG) and 6.48% (ICD-9). Conclusion Discrepancies occurred when different case definitions were used in claims data analysis. Previous reports might have overestimated the incidence, recurrence rate, and complication rate in older children. The new method might slightly underestimate them. The true incidence might lie in between.","publish_time":"2015-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Ming-Chih; Lai, Mei-Shu; Jan, Sheng-Ling; Fu, Yun-Ching","journal":"Journal of the Chinese Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cca2b3547f329ac1ade31d793e0aceae8cb7af5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105041.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcma.2014.03.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1726490114003062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636582/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1726490114003062","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Background Kawasaki"],"organizations":["Kawasaki","National Health Insurance Research Database","International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision","IVIG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICD","set","IVIG","incidence of Kawasaki disease","disease stages","cardiac disease","main diagnosis of Kawasaki disease","Abstract Background Kawasaki disease","incidence rates","acute stages","diagnosis code","true incidence","person-years","previous reports","year recurrence rate","average","Methods","coronary complication rates","epidemiological features","older children","epidemiologic features","leading cause of pediatric","different case definitions","Taiwan","peak season estimation","Revision","National Health Insurance Research Database","intravenous immunoglobulin","Significant discrepancy","claims data analysis","Conclusion Discrepancies","differences","medication","inpatients","industrialized countries","International Classification of Diseases","summer","study","new method"],"language":"en"},

Yet structural data on the viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are scarce, in spite of their essential role in the viral life cycle. To obtain more information, we developed an efficient production system of recombinant E2 ectodomain (E2e), truncated immediately upstream its trans-membrane (TM) region, using Drosophila melanogaster cells. This system yields a majority of monomeric protein, which can be readily separated chromatographically from contaminating disulfide-linked aggregates. The isolated monomeric E2e reacts with a number of conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies, binds the soluble CD81 large external loop and efficiently inhibits infection of Huh7.5 cells by infectious HCV particles (HCVcc) in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it adopts a native conformation. These properties of E2e led us to experimentally determine the connectivity of its 9 disulfide bonds, which are strictly conserved across HCV genotypes. Furthermore, circular dichroism combined with infrared spectroscopy analyses revealed the secondary structure contents of E2e, indicating in particular about 28% \u03B2-sheet, in agreement with the consensus secondary structure predictions. The disulfide connectivity pattern, together with data on the CD81 binding site and reported E2 deletion mutants, enabled the threading of the E2e polypeptide chain onto the structural template of class II fusion proteins of related flavi- and alphaviruses. The resulting model of the tertiary organization of E2 gives key information on the antigenicity determinants of the virus, maps the receptor binding site to the interface of domains I and III, and provides insight into the nature of a putative fusogenic conformational change.","publish_time":"2010-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krey, Thomas; d\u0027Alayer, Jacques; Kikuti, Carlos M.; Saulnier, Aure; Damier-Piolle, Laurence; Petitpas, Isabelle; Johansson, Daniel X.; Tawar, Rajiv G.; Baron, Bruno; Robert, Bruno; England, Patrick; Persson, Mats A.

Results The exposure-response curves suggested that the relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of \u003C3 \u00B0C and became flat above 3 \u00B0C. When mean temperature (lag0\u201314) was below 3 \u00B0C, each 1 \u00B0C rise was associated with a 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209\u20136.513) increase in the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. These findings were robust in our sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Our results indicate that mean temperature has a positive linear relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases with a threshold of 3 \u00B0C. There is no evidence supporting that case counts of COVID-19 could decline when the weather becomes warmer, which provides useful implications for policymakers and the public.","publish_time":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Jingui; Zhu, Yongjian","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f0c57ad6737d28e7e518b07ac1113bf3cd6c7b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7142675.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408450/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720317149; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720317149; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138201","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mean temperature","confirmed cases","ambient temperature","daily number of COVID","positive linear relationship","nonlinear relationship","C rise","results","piecewise linear regression","novel coronavirus","Abstract Background Coronavirus disease","severe public health problem","meteorological factors","useful implications","infection","transmission","laboratory studies","Methods","generalized additive model","GAM","findings","sensitivity analyses","policymakers","exposure-response curves","cities","essential factor","Conclusions","range","survival of coronaviruses","weather","evidence","threshold","study","lag0"],"language":"en"},

Data from these models indicate that considerable alterations in epithelial surfaces and aberrant immune responses lead to severe inflammation, a key driver of bacterial acquisition and infection severity following influenza.

METHODS: Publicly available demographic and transmission network data for all cases were collected from the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between demographic characteristics and the likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Findings from the statistical analyses were used to inform a hypothesis-directed literature review, through which mechanistic explanations for nosocomial amplification were developed. RESULTS: Cases that failed to recover from MERS were more likely to cause secondary infections than those that did. Increased probability of direct, human-to-human transmission due to clinical manifestations associated with death, as well as indirect transmission via environmental contamination (e.g., fomites and indoor ventilation systems), may serve as mechanistic explanations for nosocomial amplification of MERS-coronavirus in South Korea.

It has been defined as an acute epidemic respiratory disease characterized by mild coryzal symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, and sneezing. The nasal discharge is usually copious and thin during the first 2 days of illness, then it generally becomes more viscous and purulent. 22 The disease is self-limited. Symptoms may persist for 2 days to more than 14 days; however, the cold may abort after only 1 day. Fever, cough, sore throat, or lacrimation may or may not be present. The common cold is of itself harmless, but bacterial invasion frequently follows the initial infection. It is these secondary invaders that may produce disorders of serious consequence. The common cold is the most frequent acute illness in the United States and throughout the industrialized world. About half the population gets at least one cold every year. 5 Colds account for 40% of all time lost from jobs among employed people (23 million days of work per year) and about 30% of absenteeism from schools (26 million school days per year). Estimates vary, but the average preschool child has somewhere between 4 and 10 colds per year, and the average adult has about two to four colds per year. The actual cost of caring for patients with colds in US physicians\u0027 offices is estimated to be $1.5 billion annually. 64 Seasonal patterns of infection can be identified for some of the various types of viruses that are responsible for outbreaks of the common cold. For example, available epidemiologic data suggest early fall and late spring are the most common times to find more outbreaks of rhinovirus. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) tends to follow winter and spring incidence, with a peak number of cases found mainly in January. Parainfluenza types 1 and 2 seem to peak during the autumn, whereas parainfluenza type 3 has an increased incidence during the late spring. Adenoviruses and coronaviruses tend to produce epidemics during the winter and spring (Fig. 1) This article presents data concerning the cause, pathogenesis, and treatment of the common cold, as well as discussion of the available diagnostic tests and their use in formulating differential diagnoses.","publish_time":"1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kirkpatrick, George L.","journal":"Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86350f9291fa5cbf03bb638e3d4c62e543334113.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125839.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095454305703559; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0095454305703559","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["common cold","year","common times","days of illness","late spring","spring incidence","school days","days of work","Colds account","winter","Parainfluenza types","acute epidemic respiratory disease","available epidemiologic data","frequent acute illness","increased incidence","nasal obstruction","nasal discharge","outbreaks of rhinovirus","average adult","initial infection","available diagnostic tests","Respiratory syncytial virus","various types of viruses","average preschool child","peak number of cases","Seasonal patterns of infection","mild coryzal symptoms of rhinorrhea","early fall","patients","United States","discussion","employed people","lacrimation","cough","sore throat","bacterial invasion","cause","US physicians\u0027 offices","RSV","example","epidemics","pathogenesis","treatment","general public","disorders of serious consequence","Fever","centuries","jobs","industrialized world","sneezing","schools","article","secondary invaders","differential diagnoses","actual cost","Adenoviruses","coronaviruses","absenteeism","Estimates","autumn","population"],"language":"en"},

This virus centered perspective does not make allowance for the precept that virus fitness hinges on the virus transmission success. Virus transmission reflects the infection-shedding-transmission dynamics and, with it, the organ system involvement and other, macroscopic dimensions of the host environment. This study examines the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, belonging to eleven different families, and a mix of RNA, DNA and retroviruses. Viruses are virtually ranked in an outer- to inner-body fashion, based on the shifting organ system involvement and associated infection-shedding-transmission dynamics. As a next step, this ranking is disentangled with the aim to contrast two main host ecologies, poultry plus pig production and ruminant plus equine husbandry, as well as to create a distinction among the RNA, DNA and retroviruses, also ranked in an outer- to inner-body fashion. Spearman correlation reveals the matches among these various virus traits, as pertaining to the two host-ecologies, four infection-shedding-transmission related variables, and the three virus genomes. The collective results reveal the outer- to inner-body shifts in the interplay of host environment, virus-host interactions, and nature of the virus. Two opposing virus evolution pathways emerge, respectively for generalist type, outer-body and for specialist type, inner-body viruses. The ecological virus classification here presented is broadly consistent with the current virus classification system and offers the advantage of bringing substance and cohesion to the interrelationships among viruses and virus families. Author Summary It remains unknown how exactly viruses fit in the tree of life. Still, there is growing awareness that viruses as biological replicators are subjected to ecological sorting and so require a viable propagation strategy. In the current analysis I depart from the precept that virus fitness hinges on the virus transmission success. I examine the transmission ecologies of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, a collection of pathogens well described in terms of the organ system involvement, infection course, the extent of host damage, virus shedding profile, and virus transmission modes. The viruses are on this basis ranked in an outer- to inner-body fashion, virtually. As a next step, this ranking is disentangled with a view to contrast two main host ecologies, poultry plus pig production and ruminant plus equine husbandry, as well as to create a distinction among the RNA, DNA and retrovirus in the study. The matches among these various virus traits serve to establish the outer- to inner-body shifts in the interplay of host environment, virus-host interactions, and nature of the virus. Two opposing virus evolution pathways emerge, respectively for generalist type, outer-body and for specialist, inner-body viruses.","publish_time":"2018-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slingenbergh, Jan","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fe18190f7b54e589dccf1d3bbfd73e87bfd2ab9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e91ca7f0a468e989306bb860005081d69508910b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/492603","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus families","virus-host interactions","virus genomes","virus transmission success","virus transmission modes","ecological virus classification","inner-body viruses","virus fitness hinges","virus molecular world","various virus traits","outer-body","current virus classification system","virus centered perspective","host-ecologies","opposing virus evolution pathways","transmission ecologies","inner-body fashion","main host ecologies","inner-body shifts","transmission dynamics","interplay of host environment","transmission ecology","world main livestock viruses","current classification of animal viruses","extent of host damage","transmission related variables","corresponding host-cell infection cycle","associated infection-shedding","infection course","DNA","shifting organ system involvement","specialist type","generalist type","pig production","poultry","ruminant","total","precept","equine husbandry","matches","mix of RNA","nature","retroviruses","current analysis","ranking","study","distinction","step","ecological sorting","different families","genomic architecture","allowance","profile","macroscopic dimensions","biological replicators","terms","advantage","interrelationships","cohesion","view","aim","substance","viable propagation strategy","collection of pathogens","awareness","Spearman correlation","Author Summary","collective results","tree of life","basis"],"language":"en"},

Owing to the difficulty of extracting RNA from sputum containing mucus, sputum homogenization is desirable prior to nucleic acid isolation. We determined optimal homogenization methods for isolating viral nucleic acids from sputum. METHODS: We evaluated the following three sputum-homogenization methods: proteinase K and DNase I (PK-DNase) treatment, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine and sodium citrate (NALC) treatment. Sputum samples were spiked with inactivated MERS-CoV culture isolates. RNA was extracted from pretreated, spiked samples using the easyMAG system (bioM\u00E9rieux, France). Extracted RNAs were then subjected to rRT-PCR for MERS-CoV diagnosis (DiaPlex Q MERS-coronavirus, SolGent, Korea). RESULTS: While analyzing 15 spiked sputum samples prepared in technical duplicate, false-negative results were obtained with five (16.7%) and four samples (13.3%), respectively, by using the PBS and NALC methods. The range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed when detecting upE in sputum samples was 31.1\u201335.4 with the PK-DNase method, 34.7\u201339.0 with the PBS method, and 33.9\u201338.6 with the NALC method. Compared with the control, which were prepared by adding a one-tenth volume of 1:1,000 diluted viral culture to PBS solution, the ranges of Ct values obtained by the PBS and NALC methods differed significantly from the mean control Ct of 33.2 (both P\u003C0.0001).

We, therefore, have studied its concentrations in the sputum and plasma of patients with COPD and patients with pulmonary TB (PTB), and further investigated the mechanism-of-action effects of IL-27 on bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Methods Human bronchial epithelial cells grown on air-liquid interface culture were activated by IL-27, alone, or in combination with other inflammatory cytokines in the presence or absence of various signaling molecule inhibitors. The expression of CXCL10 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The underlying signaling pathways were studied by intracellular staining using flow cytometry, Western blot, ELISA, or siRNA. Results Significantly higher sputum and plasma concentrations of IL-27 were found in patients with COPD (n = 34; P \u003C .01 and P \u003C .001, respectively) or patients with PTB (n = 31; P \u003C .01 and P \u003C .001, respectively) than in healthy control subjects (n = 48). Sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 levels in patients with COPD correlated negatively with FEV1 (r = \u22120.51, P \u003C .01). Sputum, but not plasma, IL-27 in patients with PTB correlated positively with mycobacterial load in sputum (r = 0.48, P \u003C .05). Further in vitro studies demonstrated that IL-27 could induce gene and protein expression of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells, which was regulated by the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway. Conclusions The production of IL-27 is related to the pathogenesis of COPD and PTB, and IL-27 induces the expression of CXCL10 in bronchial epithelial cells through the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Ju; Zhang, Liping; Li, Dairong; Xu, Fang; Huang, Shifeng; Xiang, Yu; Yin, Yibing; Ren, Guosheng","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bb0cf8e5e1489b6f4d123be4ac609c5aa80634f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094562.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.10-3297; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369212600221; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369212600221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21778255/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","PTB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasma of patients","plasma concentrations of IL","production of IL","role of IL","PTB","action effects of IL","pathogenesis of COPD","higher sputum","Methods Human bronchial epithelial cells","protein expression of CXCL10","ELISA","PI3K-Akt","activation","inflammatory cytokines","pathogenesis of airway inflammatory diseases","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Western blot","intracellular staining","flow cytometry","air-liquid interface culture","absence of various","presence","OH kinase","mycobacterial load","pulmonary TB","phosphatidylinositol","Results","levels","molecule inhibitors","pathways","siRNA","healthy control subjects","FEV1","mechanism","underlying","combination","Conclusions","studies"],"language":"en"},

Persistent infection is therefore one possible explanation for the cough reflex hypersensitivity and pulmonary inflammation reported in chronic cough patients. METHODS: Bronchoscopic endobronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts were obtained from ten healthy volunteers and twenty treatment resistant chronic cough patients (10 selected for lavage lymphocytosis). A screen for known respiratory pathogens was performed on biopsy tissue. Chronic cough patients also underwent cough reflex sensitivity testing using citric acid. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in incidence of infection between healthy volunteers and chronic cough patients (p = 0.115) or non-lymphocytic and lymphocytic groups (p = 0.404). BAL cell percentages were not significantly different between healthy volunteers and chronic cough patients without lymphocytosis. Lymphocytic patients however had a significantly raised percentage of lymphocytes (p \u003C 0.01), neutrophils (p \u003C 0.05), eosinophils (p \u003C 0.05) and decreased macrophages (p \u003C 0.001) verses healthy volunteers. There was no significant difference in the cough reflex sensitivity between non-lymphocytic and lymphocytic patients (p = 0.536).

STING resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and upon activation, forms dimers which assemble with MAVS, TBK-1 and IKK\u03B5, leading to IRF-3 activation and subsequent induction of interferon (IFN). We found that expression of the membrane anchored PLP domain from human HCoV-NL63 (PLP2-TM) or SARS-CoV (PLpro-TM) inhibits STING-mediated activation of IRF-3 nuclear translocation and induction of IRF-3 dependent promoters. Both catalytically active and inactive forms of CoV PLPs co-immunoprecipitated with STING, and viral replicase proteins co-localize with STING in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. Ectopic expression of catalytically active PLP2-TM blocks STING dimer formation and negatively regulates assembly of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKK\u03B5 complexes required for activation of IRF-3. STING dimerization was also substantially reduced in cells infected with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the level of ubiquitinated forms of STING, RIG-I, TBK1 and IRF-3 are reduced in cells expressing wild type or catalytic mutants of PLP2-TM, likely contributing to disruption of signaling required for IFN induction. These results describe a new mechanism used by CoVs in which CoV PLPs negatively regulate antiviral defenses by disrupting the STING-mediated IFN induction.","publish_time":"2012-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Li; Xing, Yaling; Chen, Xiaojuan; Zheng, Yang; Yang, Yudong; Nichols, Daniel B.; Clementz, Mark A.; Banach, Bridget S.; Li, Kui; Baker, Susan C.; Chen, Zhongbin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f8012db8f2100bb1876e19722d6c131849e2315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3270028.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22312431/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030802","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLP","MITA/ERIS/MYPS","MAVS","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["assembly of STING","STING dimerization","STING-mediated activation of IRF","STING-mediated IFN induction","induction of IRF","SARS-CoV","level of ubiquitinated forms of STING","active PLP2-TM blocks STING dimer formation","CoV papain","human HCoV-NL63","PLpro-TM","infected cells","inactive forms of CoV PLPs co-immunoprecipitated","subsequent induction of interferon","forms dimers","MAVS-TBK1","innate immune","catalytic mutants of PLP2","human coronavirus","IKK\u03B5 complexes","Ectopic expression","immune response","stimulator of interferon genes","membrane anchored PLP domain","viral replicase proteins co-","severe acute respiratory syndrome","proteases","nuclear translocation","wild type","RIG","endoplasmic reticulum","antiviral defenses","molecules","MITA","CoVs","new mechanism","complex system of sensors","host","dependent promoters","disruption","elaborate mechanisms","Viruses","ERIS","MYPS","results"],"language":"en"},

Holstein calves (n=17 in trial 1; n=25 in trial 2) were housed in individual pens; bedding (wood shavings) was covered with landscape fabric to completely avoid consumption of bedding. Milk replacer was fed at 12% of birth body weight per day and water offered free choice. Calves were randomly assigned to 4 treatments differing in geometric mean particle length (Xgm) of straw comprising 5% of starter dry matter. Straw was provided within the pellet at manufacture (PS; 0.82mm Xgm) or mixed with the pellet at time of feeding at Xgm of 3.04 (SS), 7.10 (MS), or 12.7 (LS) mm. Calves (n=12; 3/treatment) in trial 1 were fitted with a rumen cannula by wk 2 of age. A fixed amount of starter that was adjusted with age and orts were fed through the cannula in cannulated calves. Calves were euthanized 6 wk after starter was offered (9 and 7 wk of age for trials 1 and 2, respectively). Rumen digesta pH linearly decreased with age, whereas volatile fatty acid concentration increased with age. Overall pH had a cubic trend with SS lower than that of PS and MS. Molar proportion of acetate decreased with age whereas propionate proportion increased. Overall molar proportions of volatile fatty acids were not affected by diet. Fecal Xgm was not different in spite of changes in diet particle size and rumen digesta of PS being greater than SS, MS, and LS at slaughter. Fecal pH and starch concentration were not affected by diet; however, pH decreased whereas starch content increased with age. Weight of stomach compartments, rumen papillae length and width, and rumen wall thickness did not differ between diets. Omasum weight as a percentage of body weight at harvest linearly decreased as straw particle size increased. Under the conditions of this study, modifying straw particle length in starter grain resulted in minimal rumen fermentation parameter changes and no changes in rumen development. Rumen pH and fermentation changes with age were likely effects of increasing starter intake.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suarez-Mena, F. X.; Heinrichs, A. J.; Jones, C.

Homozygous animals show locomotor abnormalities like lateralized circling behavior. Additionally, an impaired vision can be observed in some animals through behavioral studies. Syndromal deafness as well as retinal degeneration are features of the Usher syndrome in humans. In the present study, the mutation was identified as a base substitution (T-\u003EC) in exon 56 of Myo15, leading to an amino acid exchange from leucine (Leu) to proline (Pro) within the carboxy-terminal MyTH4 domain in the proteins\u0027 tail region. Myo15 mRNA was expressed in the retina as demonstrated for the first time with the help of in-situ hybridization and PCR. To characterize the visual phenotype, rats were examined by scotopic and photopic electroretinography and, additionally, histological analyses of the retinas were conducted. The complete loss of sight was detected along with a severe degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Interestingly, the manifestation of the disease does not solely depend on the mutation, but also on environmental factors. Since the LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat features the entire range of symptoms of the human Usher syndrome we think that this strain is an appropriate model for this disease. Our findings display that mutations in binding domains of myosin XV do not only cause non-syndromic hearing loss but can also lead to syndromic disorders including retinal dysfunction.","publish_time":"2011-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Held, Nadine; Smits, Bart M.

Flow cytometry was used to determine mode of cell death in first 42 h post infection (hpi). FIPV infected cells underwent early apoptosis at 9 hpi (p \u003C 0.05) followed by late apoptosis at 12 hpi (p \u003C 0.05) and necrosis from 24 hpi (p \u003C 0.05).

The revised International Health Regulations [IHR], which entered into force for all 194 World Health Organization member states in 2007, have expanded traditional infectious disease notification to include surveillance for public health events of potential international importance, even if the causative agent is not yet known. However, there are no clearly established guidelines for how countries should conduct this surveillance, which types of emerging disease syndromes should be reported, nor any means for enforcement. DISCUSSION: The commonly established concept of syndromic surveillance in developed regions encompasses the use of pre-diagnostic information in a near real time fashion for further investigation for public health action. Syndromic surveillance is widely used in North America and Europe, and is typically thought of as a highly complex, technology driven automated tool for early detection of outbreaks. Nonetheless, low technology applications of syndromic surveillance are being used worldwide to augment traditional surveillance. SUMMARY: In this paper, we review examples of these novel applications in the detection of vector-borne diseases, foodborne illness, and sexually transmitted infections. We hope to demonstrate that syndromic surveillance in its basic version is a feasible and effective tool for surveillance in developing countries and may facilitate compliance with the new IHR guidelines.","publish_time":"2009-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"May, Larissa; Chretien, Jean-Paul; Pavlin, Julie A","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a9fdd51745b132ee92107b4e9c68597d3767b7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2718884.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19607669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Health","World Health Organization"],"locations":["North America","Europe"],"keyphrases":["traditional surveillance","established concept of syndromic surveillance","effective disease surveillance systems","low technology applications of syndromic surveillance","public health action","early detection of outbreaks","effective tool","detection of vector","revised International Health Regulations","developing countries","established guidelines","public health events of potential international importance","traditional infectious disease notification","new IHR guidelines","World Health Organization member states","automated tool","types of emerging disease syndromes","novel applications","near real time fashion","investigation","developed regions","use of pre-diagnostic information","basic version","foodborne illness","compliance","diseases","North America","transmitted infections","examples","BACKGROUND","causative agent","paper","Europe","DISCUSSION","means","enforcement","SUMMARY"],"language":"en"},

One sequence independent method, Virus Discovery based on cDNA Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (VIDISCA) is capable of identifying viruses that would have remained unidentified in standard diagnostics or cell cultures. METHODS: VIDISCA is normally combined with next generation sequencing, however, we set up a simplified VIDISCA which can be used in case next generation sequencing is not possible. Stool samples of 10 patients with unexplained acute flaccid paralysis showing cytopathic effect in rhabdomyosarcoma cells and/or mouse cells were used to test the efficiency of this method. To further characterize the viruses, VIDISCA-positive samples were amplified and sequenced with gene specific primers. RESULTS: Simplified VIDISCA detected seven viruses (70%) and the proportion of eukaryotic viral sequences from each sample ranged from 8.3 to 45.8%. Human enterovirus EV-B97, EV-B100, echovirus-9 and echovirus-21, human parechovirus type-3, human astrovirus probably a type-3/5 recombinant, and tetnovirus-1 were identified. Phylogenetic analysis based on the VP1 region demonstrated that the human enteroviruses are more divergent isolates circulating in the community. CONCLUSION: Our data support that a simplified VIDISCA protocol can efficiently identify unrecognized viruses grown in cell culture with low cost, limited time without need of advanced technical expertise. Also complex data interpretation is avoided thus the method can be used as a powerful diagnostic tool in limited resources. Redesigning the routine diagnostics might lead to additional detection of previously undiagnosed viruses in clinical samples of patients.

It is common for these insectivorous bats to roost in anthropogenic structures in urban regions. Additionally, Neoromicia capensis have previously been identified as potential hosts for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related coronaviruses. This study aimed to ascertain the gastrointestinal virome of these bats, as viruses excreted in fecal material or which may be replicating in rectal or intestinal tissues have the greatest opportunities of coming into contact with other hosts. Samples were collected in five regions of South Africa over eight years. Initial virome composition was determined by viral metagenomic sequencing by pooling samples and enriching for viral particles. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq500 platforms, producing a combined 37 million reads. Bioinformatics analysis of the high throughput sequencing data detected the full genome of a novel species of the Circoviridae family, and also identified sequence data from the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Phenuiviridae, and Picornaviridae families. Metagenomic sequencing data was insufficient to determine the viral diversity of certain families due to the fragmented coverage of genomes and lack of suitable sequencing depth, as some viruses were detected from the analysis of reads-data only. Follow up conventional PCR assays targeting conserved gene regions for the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Herpesviridae families were used to confirm metagenomic data and generate additional sequences to determine genetic diversity. The complete coding genome of a MERS-related coronavirus was recovered with additional amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform. The new genome shared 97.2% overall nucleotide identity to a previous Neoromicia-associated MERS-related virus, also from South Africa. Conventional PCR analysis detected diverse adenovirus and herpesvirus sequences that were widespread throughout Neoromicia populations in South Africa. Furthermore, similar adenovirus sequences were detected within these populations throughout several years. With the exception of the coronaviruses, the study represents the first report of sequence data from several viral families within a Southern African insectivorous bat genus; highlighting the need for continued investigations in this regard.","publish_time":"2018-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geldenhuys, Marike; Mortlock, Marinda; Weyer, Jacqueline; Bezuidt, Oliver; Seamark, Ernest C.

SARS-CoV encodes several proteins that modulate innate immune signaling through the antagonism of the induction of Interferon and by avoidance of ISG effector functions.","publish_time":"2012-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Totura, Allison L; Baric, Ralph S","journal":"Curr Opin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/185b7937f511fb8fe9edb47eb508fea5876aeecf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102726.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625712000715; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625712000715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22572391/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.04.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Interferon Stimulated Gene","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","association SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV pathogenesis","SARS-CoV disease states","key components of innate immune","Interferon Stimulated Gene","exacerbated disease phenotypes","induction of Interferon","host factors","protective factors","Gene transcription signatures unique","avoidance of ISG effector functions","responses","aberrant cytokine","pathways","chemokine","evidence","patients","zoonotic reservoir","pathogenic coronavirus","global dissemination","antagonism","STAT1","proteins","MyD88","models"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARMS-I\u2122 (currently marketed as Halo\u2122) in the prevention of URIs. METHODS: ARMS-I is patented novel formulation for the prevention and treatment of influenza, comprising a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent (cetylpyridinium chloride, CPC) and components (glycerin and xanthan gum) that form a barrier on the host mucosa, thus preventing viral contact and invasion. Healthy adults (18\u201345 years of age) were randomized into ARMS-I or placebo group (50 subjects each). The drug was sprayed intra-orally (3\u00D7 daily) for 75 days. The primary objectives were to establish whether ARMS-I decreased the frequency, severity or duration of URIs. Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety, tolerability, rate of virus detection, acceptability and adherence; effect on URI-associated absenteeism and medical visits; and effect of prior influenza vaccination on study outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 94 individuals who completed the study (placebo: n = 44, ARMS-I: n = 50), six presented with confirmed URI (placebo: 4, ARMS-I: 2), representing a 55% relative reduction, albeit this was statistically not significant). Influenza, coronavirus or rhinovirus were detected in three participants; all in the placebo group. Moreover, frequency of post-treatment exit visits was reduced by 55% in ARMS-I compared to the placebo group (N = 4 and 2, respectively). Fever was reported only in the placebo group. ARMS-I significantly reduced the frequency and severity of cough and sore throat, and duration of cough (P \u2264 .019 for all comparisons). ARMS-I was safe, well tolerated, had high acceptability and high adherence to medication use. Medical visits occurred only in the placebo group while absenteeism did not differ between the two arms. Prior influenza vaccination had no effect on study outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized proof-of-concept clinical trial demonstrated that ARMS-I tended to provide protection against URIs in the enrolled study participants, while reducing severity and duration of cough and sore throat. A clinical trial with a larger number of study participants is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02644135 (retrospectively registered).

After the first challenge, obvious diarrhea and viral shedding developed successively in all pigs in the four inoculation dose groups from 3 to 14 days postinfection (dpi), and all pigs recovered (no clinical symptoms or viral shedding) by 21 dpi. All pigs in the four groups exhibited significantly increased PDCoV-specific IgG, IgA and virus-neutralizing (VN) antibody (Ab) titers and IFN-\u03B3 levels in the serum after the first challenge. All pigs were completely protected against rechallenge at 21 dpi. The serum levels of PDCoV-specific IgG, IgA, and VN Abs increased further after rechallenge. Notably, the IFN-\u03B3 level declined continuously after 7 dpi. In addition, the levels of PDCoV-specific IgG, IgA and VN Abs in saliva increased significantly after rechallenge and correlated well with the serum Ab titers. Furthermore, the appearance of clinical symptoms of PDCoV infection in conventionally weaned pigs was delayed with reduced inoculation doses.

METHODS: To look at phase 3 from the endpoint\u2014in this case hospital admission\u2014should facilitate the focus on key variables upstream. Based on a simplified model of approximated and plausible parameters for the overall attack rate (AR), the AR(hospitalization) and the AR(ICU admission), the resources needed are compared with the available resources i.e. number of beds available in general and beds in ICU in particular. The calculations are carried out population-based for Ploen County as well as regionally together with the Kiel metropolitan area. RESULTS: Since the ARs in the up do date available cohorts are overestimated, considerably lower AR(hospitalization) and AR(ICU) should be expected. An AR(hospitalization) of 10% could not be materialized in Ploen County; one with 5% could. In the regional analysis together with the University Hospital Kiel (UKSH) an AR(hospitalization) of up to 10% is feasible, as also an AR(ICU) of 3%. The kinetics of hospital admissions is, however, dependent from countermeasures in public health as well as admission habits of the family physicians. The available number of beds is determined by beds made available and by the mean duration of hospitalization. The latter depends from the age and underlying conditions of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: System failure has to be averted by clarity in regard to the key parameters and their independent variables. The regional management is crucial and should be coordinated by a so-called bed-coordinator.

The model provides a testable hypothesis by considering a dynamical equation for the contact parameter, which drops exponentially with time, simulating control measures. We discuss the role of modelling in public health and we analyse the distinction between forecasting and projection models as assessing tools for the estimation of the impact of intervention strategies. The model is applied to the communities of Hong Kong and Toronto (Canada) and it mimics those epidemics with fairly good accuracy. The estimated values for the basic reproduction number, R 0, were 1.2 for Hong Kong and 1.32 for Toronto (Canada). The model projects that, in the absence of control, the final number of cases would be 320,000 in Hong Kong and 36,900 in Toronto (Canada). In contrast, with control measures, which reduce the contact rate to about 25% of its initial value, the expected final number of cases is reduced to 1778 in Hong Kong and 226 in Toronto (Canada). Although SARS can be a devastating infection, early recognition, prompt isolation, and appropriate precaution measures, can be very effective to limit its spread.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Massad, Eduardo; Burattini, Marcelo N.; Lopez, Luis F.; Coutinho, Francisco A.B.","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65dffaf5709ea8622c4d95b459ee8be719b43323.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116954.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987705000800; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987705000800","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Toronto","Canada","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Toronto","Canada","impact of control measures","communities of Hong Kong","absence of control","model projects","expected final number of cases","appropriate precaution measures","simple mathematical model","SARS","basic reproduction number","devastating infection","emerging infection","contact parameter","contact rate","impact of intervention strategies","prompt isolation","analysis","early recognition","distinction","dynamical equation","estimation","tools","severe acute respiratory syndrome","projection models","public health","forecasting","estimated values","work","testable hypothesis","initial value","role of modelling","epidemics","time","good accuracy","contrast","spread","Summary"],"language":"en"},

Despite efforts to identify the critical interactions of these viruses with host machinery, the key regulatory events that lead to disease pathology remain poorly targeted with therapeutics. Here we implement an integrated network interrogation approach, in which proteome and transcriptome datasets from infection of both viruses in human lung epithelial cells are utilized to predict regulatory genes involved in the host response. We take advantage of a novel \u201Ccrowd-based\u201D approach to identify and combine ranking metrics that isolate genes/proteins likely related to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV and influenza virus. Subsequently, a multivariate regression model is used to compare predicted lung epithelial regulatory influences with data derived from other respiratory virus infection models. We predicted a small set of regulatory factors with conserved behavior for consideration as important components of viral pathogenesis that might also serve as therapeutic targets for intervention. Our results demonstrate the utility of integrating diverse \u2018omic datasets to predict and prioritize regulatory features conserved across multiple pathogen infection models.","publish_time":"2013-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitchell, Hugh D.; Eisfeld, Amie J.; Sims, Amy C.; McDermott, Jason E.; Matzke, Melissa M.; Webb-Robertson, Bobbi-Jo M.; Tilton, Susan C.; Tchitchek, Nicolas; Josset, Laurence; Li, Chengjun; Ellis, Amy L.; Chang, Jean H.; Heegel, Robert A.; Luna, Maria L.; Schepmoes, Athena A.; Shukla, Anil K.; Metz, Thomas O.; Neumann, Gabriele; Benecke, Arndt G.; Smith, Richard D.; Baric, Ralph S.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Katze, Michael G.; Waters, Katrina M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccaafc13b2c1551dce74e1a7fe3e43cea5228732.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3723910.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23935999/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulatory genes","regulatory features","respiratory virus infection models","influenza viruses","predicted lung epithelial regulatory influences","key regulatory events","SARS-CoV","small set of regulatory factors","Respiratory infections","multiple pathogen infection models","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus","host machinery","human lung epithelial cells","conserved behavior","pathogenicity of SARS","transcriptome datasets","omic datasets","host response","integrated network interrogation approach","consideration","serious public health threat","proteome","disease pathology","important components of viral pathogenesis","emerging pandemics","critical interactions","utility","proteins","ranking metrics","therapeutics","novel","crowd","multivariate regression model","therapeutic targets","intervention","advantage","results","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of C57Bl/6 mice is a model of viral encephalitis in which the compromise results in hippocampal damage and permanent neurological sequelae. We previously identified brain-infiltrating inflammatory monocytes as the primary driver of this hippocampal pathology, but the mechanisms involved in recruiting these cells to the brain were unclear. METHODS: Chemokine expression levels in the hippocampus were assessed by microarray, ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Monocyte infiltration during acute TMEV infection was measured by flow cytometry. CCL2 levels were manipulated by immunodepletion and by specific removal from neurons in mice generated by crossing a line expressing the Cre recombinase behind the synapsin promoter to animals with floxed CCL2. RESULTS: Inoculation of the brain with TMEV induced hippocampal production of the proinflammatory chemokine CCL2 that peaked at 6 h postinfection, whereas inoculation with UV-inactivated TMEV did not elicit this response. Immunofluorescence revealed that hippocampal neurons expressed high levels of CCL2 at this timepoint. Genetic deletion of CCR2 and systemic immunodepletion of CCL2 abrogated or blunted the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during acute infection. Specific genetic deletion of CCL2 from neurons reduced serum and hippocampal CCL2 levels and inhibited inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that intracranial inoculation with infectious TMEV rapidly induces the expression of CCL2 in neurons, and this cellular source is necessary for CCR2-dependent infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during the most acute stage of encephalitis. These findings highlight a unique role for neuronal production of chemokines in the initiation of leukocytic infiltration into the infected central nervous system.","publish_time":"2017-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Howe, Charles L.; LaFrance-Corey, Reghann G.; Goddery, Emma N.; Johnson, Renee K.; Mirchia, Kanish","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e85184d2ba432306c3c21f22113aa590b09fe89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5715496.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-017-1015-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202854/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Theiler"],"organizations":["TMEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hippocampal CCL2 levels","hippocampal neurons","expression of CCL2","floxed CCL2","high levels of CCL2","identified brain","inflammatory monocyte infiltration","acute TMEV infection","systemic immunodepletion of CCL2","proinflammatory chemokine CCL2","hippocampal production","Specific genetic deletion of CCL2","hippocampal damage","hippocampal pathology","CCR2-dependent infiltration of inflammatory monocytes","infectious TMEV","acute infection","Chemokine expression levels","initiation of leukocytic infiltration","UV-inactivated TMEV","acute stage of encephalitis","compromise results","infection of C57Bl","Genetic deletion of CCR2","need","mice","model of viral encephalitis","intracranial inoculation","immunofluorescence","dangerous compromise","specific removal","neuronal production of chemokines","synapsin promoter","serum","unique role","infected central nervous system","animals","permanent neurological sequelae","Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus","hippocampus","cellular source","primary driver","Cre recombinase","h postinfection","microarray","ELISA","RT-PCR","clear pathogen","flow cytometry","findings","line","mechanisms","cells","BACKGROUND","bystander injury","METHODS","timepoint","CONCLUSIONS","response"],"language":"en"},

Our understanding of viral diversity derives primarily from comparisons among host species, precluding insight into how intraspecific variation in host ecology affects viral communities or how predictable viral communities are across populations. Here we test spatial, demographic and environmental hypotheses explaining viral richness and community composition across populations of common vampire bats, which occur in diverse habitats of North, Central and South America. We demonstrate marked variation in viral communities that was not consistently predicted by a null model of declining community similarity with increasing spatial or genetic distances separating populations. We also find no evidence that larger bat colonies host greater viral diversity. Instead, viral diversity follows an elevational gradient, is enriched by juvenile\u2010biased age structure, and declines with local anthropogenic food resources as measured by livestock density. Our results establish the value of linking the modern influx of metagenomic sequence data with comparative ecology, reveal that snapshot views of viral diversity are unlikely to be representative at the species level, and affirm existing ecological theories that link host ecology not only to single pathogen dynamics but also to viral communities.","publish_time":"2019-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bergner, Laura M.; Orton, Richard J.; Benavides, Julio A.; Becker, Daniel J.; Tello, Carlos; Biek, Roman; Streicker, Daniel G.","journal":"Mol Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2a69ec62b5553d158b04c9a91409e451f91e2ee.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8ca98b59fa6bb5b1d4dfdb0b89cfcdbcaa1a0474.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7004108.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561274/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South America"],"keyphrases":["viral richness","greater viral diversity","understanding of viral diversity","predictable viral communities","snapshot views of viral diversity","host ecology","host species","sources of genetic diversity","comparative ecology","community composition","genetic distances","populations of common vampire bats","intraspecific variation","species level","marked variation","null model of declining community similarity","declines","environmental hypotheses","drivers of biochemical cycles","local anthropogenic food resources","agents of disease","larger bat colonies","modern influx of metagenomic sequence data","insight","critical roles","existing ecological theories","single pathogen dynamics","diverse habitats of North","juvenile","biased age structure","comparisons","forms of life","evidence","elevational gradient","South America","livestock density","value","hosts","Viruses","results"],"language":"en"},

Despite nearly six decades having passed since its first emergence, different studies have shown that type II FCoV represents only a small portion of the total FCoV seropositivity in cats; hence, there is very limited knowledge of the evolution of type II FCoV. To elucidate the correlation between viral emergence and FIP, a local isolate (NTU156) that was derived from a FIP cat was analyzed along with other worldwide strains. Containing an in-frame deletion of 442 nucleotides in open reading frame 3c, the complete genome size of NTU156 (28,897 nucleotides) appears to be the smallest among the known type II feline coronaviruses. Bootscan analysis revealed that NTU156 evolved from two crossover events between type I FCoV and canine coronavirus, with recombination sites located in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and M genes. With an exchange of nearly one-third of the genome with other members of alphacoronaviruses, the new emerging virus could gain new antigenicity, posing a threat to cats that either have been infected with a type I virus before or never have been infected with FCoV.

The role of IFITM3 in the central nervous system (CNS) is, however, largely unknown, despite the fact that its expression is increased in the brains of patients with neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we show the role of IFITM3 in long\u2010lasting neuronal impairments in mice following polyriboinosinic\u2010polyribocytidylic acid (polyI:C, a synthetic double\u2010stranded RNA)\u2010induced immune challenge during the early stages of development. We found that the induction of IFITM3 expression in the brain of mice treated with polyI:C was observed only in astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes were activated by polyI:C treatment, leading to an increase in the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines as well as Ifitm3. When cultured neurons were treated with the conditioned medium of polyI:C\u2010treated astrocytes (polyI:C\u2010ACM), neurite development was impaired. These polyI:C\u2010ACM\u2010induced neurodevelopmental abnormalities were alleviated by ifitm3(\u2212/\u2212) astrocyte\u2010conditioned medium. Furthermore, decreases of MAP2 expression, spine density, and dendrite complexity in the frontal cortex as well as memory impairment were evident in polyI:C\u2010treated wild\u2010type mice, but such neuronal impairments were not observed in ifitm3(\u2212)(/)(\u2212) mice. We also found that IFITM3 proteins were localized to the early endosomes of astrocytes following polyI:C treatment and reduced endocytic activity. These findings suggest that the induction of IFITM3 expression in astrocytes by the activation of the innate immune system during the early stages of development has non\u2010cell autonomous effects that affect subsequent neurodevelopment, leading to neuropathological impairments and brain dysfunction, by impairing endocytosis in astrocytes.

The development of antiviral agents to treat non-HIV infections is largely focused on therapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis infections B and C. Nucleoside analog continue to be the mainstay of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) therapeutics. The first small molecule inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), the NS3 protease inhibitor BILN-2061, entered phase 2 clinical trials, producing a striking reduction in viral load in treated individuals. The development of the HCV replicon system and its application to screening for antiviral agents provided tangible benefit with the disclosure of mechanistically and structurally diverse HCV inhibitors. Adefovir dipivoxil has been approved in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of HBV, providing a second small molecule antiviral to add to lamivudine (3TC) and the injectable protein IFN\u03B1 as the only approved agents for treating HBV infection. The chapter also provides details of the inhibitors of hepatitis B and C virus, the inhibitors of simplex virus and human cytomegalovirus, the inhibitors of respiratory viruses and the inhibitors of West Nile virus and Papilloma virus.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meanwell, Nicholas A.; Serrano-Wu, Michael H.; Snyder, Lawrence B.","journal":"Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9f41ee674c330fe3fb6c9a089af070d6bc6ca8c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287463/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065774303380236; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065774303380236; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0065-7743(03)38023-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hepatitis C Virus","HBV"],"locations":["United States","European Union","West Nile"],"keyphrases":["inhibitors of simplex virus","inhibitors of hepatitis B","mainstay of Hepatitis B Virus","Papilloma virus","development of antiviral agents","inhibitors of West Nile virus","small molecule inhibitor of Hepatitis C Virus","diverse HCV inhibitors","non-HIV antiviral agents","approved agents","small molecule antiviral","treatment of HBV","treatment of chronic hepatitis infections B","inhibitors of respiratory viruses","non-HIV infections","HBV infection","chapter","HCV replicon system","NS3 protease inhibitor BILN","striking reduction","human cytomegalovirus","Nucleoside analog","viral load","European Union","disclosure","therapies","application","injectable protein IFN\u03B1","treated individuals","TC","clinical trials","phase","tangible benefit","lamivudine","details","therapeutics","United States","Publisher Summary","Adefovir dipivoxil"],"language":"en"},

How Many Times?","doi":"10.1021/acsnano.0c03597","pmcid":"PMC7202248","pubmed_id":"32368894","license":"no-cc","abstract":"[Image: see text] The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a major shortage of N95 respirators, which are essential for protecting healthcare professionals and the general public who may come into contact with the virus. Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protective equipment in these urgent times. We investigated multiple commonly used disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Heating was recently found to inactivate the virus in solution within 5 min at 70 \u00B0C and is among the most scalable, user-friendly methods for viral disinfection. We found that heat (\u226485 \u00B0C) under various humidities (\u2264100% relative humidity, RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. At 85 \u00B0C, 30% RH, we were able to perform 50 cycles of heat treatment without significant changes in the filtration efficiency. At low humidity or dry conditions, temperatures up to 100 \u00B0C were not found to alter the filtration efficiency significantly within 20 cycles of treatment. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice, which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can potentially impact the material strength and subsequent sealing of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach all may lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Lei; Xiao, Wang; Zhao, Mervin; Yu, Xuanze; Wang, Haotian; Wang, Qiqi; Chu, Steven; Cui, Yi","journal":"ACS Nano","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c80b93410a02a0db3c1de92eef2c86037d743350.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202248.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368894/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c03597","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cycles of treatment","particle filtration efficiency","cycles of heat treatment","preservation of filtration properties","N95-grade respirators","viral disinfection","major shortage of N95 respirators","subsequent sealing of respirators","UV","RH","small degradation","low humidity","relative humidity","viral aerosols","used disinfection schemes","media","significant changes","meltblown fabrics","caution","steam","personal protective equipment","temperatures","material strength","user vulnerable","nondestructive method","general public","vapors","alcohol","urgent times","irradiation","healthcare professionals","dry conditions","household bleach","secondary choice","user-friendly methods","coronavirus disease","various humidities","text","COVID","treatments","liquids","pandemic","contact","Image","solution","Heating"],"language":"en"},

This has led to the need to use adjuvants to improve vaccine immunogenicity. The ideal adjuvant should maximize vaccine immunogenicity without compromising tolerability or safety or posing undue risk. Unfortunately, adjuvant research has lagged behind other vaccine areas such as antigen discovery, with the consequence that only a very limited number of adjuvants based on aluminum salts, monophosphoryl lipid A and oil emulsions are currently approved for human use. Recent strategic initiatives to support adjuvant development by the National Institutes of Health should translate into greater adjuvant choices in the future. Mechanistic studies have been valuable in better understanding adjuvant action but mechanisms of adjuvant toxicity are less well understood. The inflammatory or danger-signal model of adjuvant action implies that increased vaccine reactogenicity is the inevitable price for improved immunogenicity. Hence, adjuvant reactogenicity may be avoidable only if it is possible to separate inflammation from adjuvant action. The biggest remaining challenge in the adjuvant field is to decipher the potential relationship between adjuvants and rare vaccine adverse reactions such as narcolepsy, macrophagic myofasciitis or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. While existing adjuvants based on aluminum salts have a strong safety record, there is an ongoing need for new adjuvants and for more intensive research into adjuvants and their effects.","publish_time":"2015-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrovsky, Nikolai","journal":"Drug Safety","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c26d655ab85161130281014409a95b087c548070.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fddd6083ae049444ab80313b1093834d6949d211.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4615573.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4615573?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-015-0350-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26446142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Institutes of Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adjuvant reactogenicity","adjuvant research","adjuvant development","adjuvant field","ideal adjuvant","vaccine safety","vaccine areas","mechanisms of adjuvant toxicity","reduced vaccine immunogenicity","greater adjuvant choices","better understanding adjuvant action","new adjuvants","existing adjuvants","increased vaccine reactogenicity","danger-signal model of adjuvant action","improved immunogenicity","limited number of adjuvants","rare vaccine adverse reactions","Improved use","aluminum salts","human use","strong safety record","intensive research","ongoing need","narcolepsy","potential relationship","inevitable price","macrophagic myofasciitis","monophosphoryl lipid","oil emulsions","National Institutes of Health","tolerability","pure antigens","consequence","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","antigen discovery","biggest remaining challenge","Recent strategic initiatives","Mechanistic studies","undue risk","future","effects","inflammation","efficacy"],"language":"en"},

Peptides, however, may represent a special opportunity. For all enveloped viruses, fusion between the viral and the target cell membrane is an obligatory step of the life cycle. Class I fusion proteins harbor regions with a repeating pattern of amino acids, the heptad repeats (HRs), that play a key role in fusion, and HR\u2010derived peptides such as enfuvirtide, in clinical use for HIV, can block the process. Because of their characteristic sequence pattern, HRs are easily identified in the genome by means of computer programs, providing the sequence of candidate peptide inhibitors directly from genomic information. Moreover, a simple chemical modification, the attachment of a cholesterol group, can dramatically increase the antiviral potency of HR\u2010derived inhibitors and simultaneously improve their pharmacokinetics. Further enhancement can be provided by dimerization of the cholesterol\u2010conjugated peptide. The examples reported so far include inhibitors of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, henipaviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses. For some of these viruses, in vivo efficacy has been demonstrated in suitable animal models. The combination of bioinformatic lead identification and potency/pharmacokinetics improvement provided by cholesterol conjugation may form the basis for a rapid response strategy, where development of an emergency cholesterol\u2010conjugated therapeutic would immediately follow the availability of the genetic information of a new enveloped virus.

Some of these viruses preferentially infect oligodendrocytes in the white matter, causing either direct lysis of infected cells, or more commonly myelin damage as a consequence of the host immune response to the virus. Virus-induced demyelination has similarities to the human disease multiple sclerosis. To study this disease process in experimental animals, mice are infected, most commonly, with neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus or Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis, a picornavirus. While the diseases caused by these two viruses differ in some aspects, in both cases demyelination is a major consequence of the infection. As in autoimmune disease, therapeutic interventions that diminish an overactive immune response would be useful. However, unlike autoimmune disease, complete suppression would result in unchecked virus replication, generally leading to more severe disease. Here we discuss two approaches that dampen but do not fully suppress the host immune response. Regulatory T cells, especially those that are specific for antigens recognized by pathogenic T cells, and IL-10 are two anti-inflammatory/pro-resolution factors that demonstrate efficacy in experimental models of virus-induced demyelination and may be useful in patients infected with viruses that cause demyelination.","publish_time":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perlman, Stanley; Zhao, Jingxian","journal":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a32ad2eb286dd0a2c080eb4038f6014eda6461c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5474348.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572816304325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28065579/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165572816304325; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2017.01.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Virus-induced demyelination","autoimmune disease","disease process","Neurotropic viruses","severe disease","experimental models of virus","host immune response","cases demyelination","unchecked virus replication","overactive immune response","human disease multiple sclerosis","neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus","pathogenic T cells","direct lysis of infected cells","Regulatory T cells","experimental animals","human populations","major consequence","similarities","coronavirus","efficacy","important causes of morbidity","complete suppression","therapeutic interventions","pro-resolution factors","mortality","Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis","mice","white matter","anti-inflammatory","antigens","myelin damage","patients","picornavirus","oligodendrocytes","aspects","infection","diseases","approaches"],"language":"en"},

Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, encode TLRs which primary role is to protect the tissue integrity. However, deregulated activation of TLRs in microglia may lead to chronic neurodegeneration. This double role of microglial responses is often reported in immune\u2010driven neurologic diseases, as in multiple sclerosis (MS). Consequently, strategies to manipulate microglia inflammatory responses may help to ameliorate disease progression. In this context, the anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)\u201010 appears as an attractive target. In this study, we investigated how activation of microglia by TLRs with distinct roles in MS impacts on IL\u201010 production. We found that activation of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 induced the production of IL\u201010 to a greater extent than activation of TLR3. This was surprising as both TLR3 and IL\u201010 play protective roles in animal models of MS. Interestingly, combination of TLR3 triggering with the other TLRs, enhanced IL\u201010 through the modulation of its transcription, via interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03B2, but independently of IL\u201027. Thus, in addition to the modulation of inflammatory responses of the periphery described for the axis TLR3/IFN\u2010\u03B2, we now report a direct modulation of microglial responses. We further show that the presence of IFN\u2010\u03B3 in the microenvironment abrogated the modulation of IL\u201010 by TLR3, whereas that of IL\u201017 had no effect. Considering the therapeutic application of IFN\u2010\u03B2 in MS, our study bears important implications for the understanding of the cytokine network regulating microglia responses in this setting.","publish_time":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lobo\u2010Silva, Diogo; Carriche, Guilhermina M.; Castro, A.

However, several reports have shown that conventional and real-time PCR assays were very specific for SARS CoV but lack sensitivity depending on the assay, specimen, and time course of disease. Objective: To evaluate an automatic nucleic acid extraction system and two standardized real-time PCR assays for rapid diagnosis of SARS CoV during outbreak and post-epidemic periods in Hong Kong. Study design: Specimens from clinically suspected SARS patients collected during outbreak and post-epidemic periods were tested by an automatic nucleic acid extraction system followed by our first generation conventional RT-PCR and two standardized real-time PCR assays (Artus GmbH, Germany and Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Paired serum samples were assayed for increasing titer against SARS CoV. Results: In the SARS epidemic, Artus and Roche PCR assays exhibited sensitivities of 87% and 85% for respiratory specimens (n =64), 91% and 88% for stool (n =44), and 82% for urine (n =29). A specificity of 100% was exhibited by both PCR assays except Artus attained only a 92% specificity for stool. For post-epidemic period, no SARS CoV was identified among 56 respiratory specimens by all PCR assays. Inhibitors to PCR assays were detected at an average rate of 7\u20138% among 202 clinical specimens. Conclusion: This study highlights the high throughput and performance of automatic RNA extraction in coordination with standardized real-time PCR assays suitable for large-scale routine diagnosis in case of future SARS epidemic. As no SARS CoV was detected among specimens collected during post-epidemic period, the positive predictive value of real-time PCR assays for detection of SARS CoV during low epidemic requires further evaluation.","publish_time":"2005-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yam, W.

The issues of food safety and food poisoning are being increasingly emphasised, particularly in developed countries. Infection/contamination with many agents i.e., bacterial, parasitic and viral entities can result in foodborne illness. This article will focus mainly on viral agents of infection. A range of different viruses can cause food poisoning/foodborne infection, and infection can result in a myriad of symptoms, ranging from mild, acute disease to chronic, debilitating disease and even death. Due to the inherent differences between bacteria and viruses, namely the fact that viruses do not replicate in food, while bacteria do, viruses are frequently difficult to detect. This is compounded by the fact that many of the viruses associated with enteric disease do not replicate in cell culture. These factors can lead to a lag between reporting, detection and analysis of foodborne viruses versus bacterial agents. Despite these constraints, it is now evident that there are both well-established and emerging viruses implicated in foodborne infections, and the role of molecular detection and characterisation is becoming increasingly important.","publish_time":"2019-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Shea, Helen; Blacklaws, Barbara A.; Collins, Patrick J.; McKillen, John; Fitzgerald, Rose","journal":"Reference Module in Life Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d5e850c708accfaa934b30d4a4516a969f7401c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157469.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128096338902735; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128096338902735","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of foodborne viruses","emerging viruses","range of different viruses","food poisoning","Foodborne pathogens","foodborne infections","foodborne illness","viral agents of infection","acute disease","bacterial agents","debilitating disease","issues of food safety","enteric disease","different durations","viral entities","chronic health outcomes","role of molecular detection","mortality","severity","high costs","characterisation","lag","reporting","burdens","society","myriad of symptoms","death","inherent differences","contamination","cell culture","developed countries","article","constraints","factors"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of this study were to determine the heritability and associative genetic relationships among immune system traits (i.e., cortisol, total IgG, IgG isotypes, and IL-8) in cattle monitored for BRD incidence. At an average of 83 d after weaning (219 d age and mean = 221.7 kg [SD 4.34]), crossbred Bos taurus steer calves (n = 2,869) were received at a commercial feedlot in southeastern Colorado over a 2-yr period. At receiving, jugular blood samples were collected at 212 (yr 1) and 226 d (yr 2) of age for immune trait analyses. The BRD phenotype was defined as a binomial variable (0 = no and 1 = yes) and compared with immune system traits measured at receiving (prior to illness onset).

Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) has become the primary respiratory support, replacing invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Our objective was to evaluate the economic and clinical consequences following implementation of this respiratory strategy in our unit. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of 525 infants with bronchiolitis requiring respiratory support and successively treated during two distinct periods with invasive MV between 1996 and 2000, P1 (n = 193) and nCPAP between 2006 and 2010, P2 (n = 332). Costs were estimated using the hospital cost billing reports. RESULTS: Patients\u2019 baseline characteristics were similar between the two periods. P2 is associated with a significant decrease in the length of ventilation (LOV) (4.1 \u00B1 3.5 versus 6.9 \u00B1 4.6 days, p \u003C 0.001), PICU length of stay (LOS) (6.2 \u00B1 4.6 versus 9.7 \u00B1 5.5 days, p \u003C 0.001) and hospital LOS. nCPAP was independently associated with a shorter duration of ventilatory support than MV (hazard ratio 1.8, 95 % CI 1.5\u20132.2, p \u003C 0.001). nCPAP was also associated with a significant decrease in ventilation-associated complications, and less invasive management. The mean cost of acute viral bronchiolitis-related PICU hospitalizations was significantly decreased, from 17,451 to 11,205 \u20AC (p \u003C 0.001). Implementation of nCPAP led to a reduction of the total annual cost of acute viral bronchiolitis hospitalizations of 715,000 \u20AC. CONCLUSION: nCPAP in severe bronchiolitis is associated with a significant improvement in patient management as shown by the reduction in invasive care, LOV, PICU LOS, hospital LOS, and economic burden.","publish_time":"2013-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Essouri, Sandrine; Laurent, Marie; Chevret, Laurent; Durand, Philippe; Ecochard, Emmanuelle; Gajdos, Vincent; Devictor, Denis; Tissi\u00E8res, Pierre","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e380520bdf1fec90bff0713dd7a8b6056d0dd0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095309.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-013-3129-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24158409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PICU LOS","Implementation of nCPAP","Severe bronchiolitis","invasive MV","hospital LOS","invasive care","invasive management","ventilation-associated complications","invasive mechanical ventilation","mean cost of acute viral bronchiolitis-related PICU hospitalizations","significant decrease","length of ventilation","primary respiratory support","PICU length of stay","total annual cost of acute viral bronchiolitis hospitalizations","reduction","respiratory strategy","significant improvement","LOV","hospital cost billing reports","P2","days","shorter duration of ventilatory support","pediatric intensive care unit","patient management","economic burden","distinct periods","leading cause of admission","infants","Nasal continuous positive airway pressure","hazard ratio","clinical consequences","Patients\u2019 baseline characteristics","retrospective cohort analysis","RESULTS","PURPOSE","CONCLUSION","METHODS","P1","Costs","objective"],"language":"en"},

However, an effective mucosal vaccine against the currently prevalent PEDV strain is not available. In this study, we demonstrated that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike (S) protein of PEDV represents a new vaccine candidate molecule to be applied via the mucosal route. We first established an Escherichia coli expression system producing the partial NTD (NTD(231\u2013501)) of the PEDV S protein. Orally administered NTD(231\u2013501) protein specifically interacted with the apical area of M cells in the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer\u0027s patch. Additionally, the NTD protein induced antigen-specific immune responses in both the systemic and mucosal immune compartments when administered orally.

To date, little is known about the molecular epidemiology of PDCoV in southern China where major swine production is operated. RESULTS: To investigate the prevalence of PDCoV in this region and compare its activity to other enteric disease of swine caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus group C (Rota C), 390 fecal samples were collected from swine of various ages from 15 swine farms with reported diarrhea. Fecal samples were tested by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) that targeted PDCoV, PEDV, TGEV, and Rota C, respectively. PDCoV was detected exclusively from nursing piglets with an overall prevalence of approximate 1.28 % (5/390), not in suckling and fattening piglets. Interestingly, all of PDCoV-positive samples were from 2015 rather than 2012\u20132014. Despite a low detection rate, PDCoV emerged in each province/region of southern China. In addition, compared to TGEV (1.54 %, 5/390) or Rota C (1.28 %, 6/390), there were highly detection rates of PEDV (22.6 %, 88/390) in those samples. Notably, all five PDCoV-positive piglets were co-infected by PEDV. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) gene sequences of PDCoVs revealed that currently circulating PDCoVs in southern China were more closely related to other Chinese strains of PDCoVs than to those reported in United States, South Korea and Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that PDCoV was present in southern China despite the low prevalence, and supported an evolutionary theory of geographical clustering of PDCoVs.

The QAC being tested is an antibacterial film that is sprayed onto a surface and can remain active for up to 8 h. A field experimental study was designed with the QAC plus daily hypochlorite cleaning as the experimental group and hypochlorite cleaning alone as the control group. The method of swabbing on moistened surfaces was used for sampling. It was found that 83% and 77% of the bedside surfaces of MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative patients respectively were contaminated with staphylococci at 08:00 hours, and that the staphylococcal concentrations increased by 80% at 1200 h over a 4-hour period with routine ward and clinical activities. Irrespective of the MRSA status of the patients, high-touch surfaces around the bed-units within the studied medical ward were heavily contaminated (ranged 1 to 276 cfu/cm(2) amongst the sites with positive culture) with staphylococcal bacteria including MRSA, despite the implementation of daily hypochlorite wiping. However, the contamination rate dropped significantly from 78% to 11% after the application of the QAC polymer. In the experimental group, the mean staphylococcal concentration of bedside surfaces was significantly (p \u003C 0.0001) reduced from 4.4 \u00B1 8.7 cfu/cm(2) at 08:00 hours to 0.07 \u00B1 0.26 cfu/cm(2) at 12:00 hours by the QAC polymer. The results of this study support the view that, in addition to hypochlorite wiping, the tested QAC surfactant is a potential environmental decontamination strategy for preventing the transmission of clinically important pathogens in medical wards.","publish_time":"2015-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuen, John W.

One year after the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) initiated its Zika response, more than 30 variants of preventive behaviors were being promoted. This situation challenged social and behavior change (SBC) programming efforts that require a coordinated response and agreed upon set of focus behaviors to be effective. To support USAID implementing partners in harmonizing prevention efforts to reduce Zika infection, we developed an evidence-based process to identify behaviors with the highest potential to reduce Zika infection and transmission. We compiled a full list of behaviors and selected the most promising for a full evidence review. The review included systematic keyword searches on Google Scholar, extraction of all relevant published articles on Aedes-borne diseases between 2012 and 2018, review of seminal papers, and review of gray literature. We examined articles to determine each behavior\u0027s potential effectiveness in preventing Zika transmission or reducing the Aedes aegypti population. We also developed assessment criteria to delineate the ease with which the target population could adopt each behavior, including: (1) required frequency; (2) feasibility of the behavior; and (3) accessibility and cost of the necessary materials in the setting. These behaviors were refined through a consensus-building process with USAID\u0027s Zika implementing partners, considering contextual factors. The resulting 7 evidence-based preventive behaviors have high potential to strengthen SBC programming\u0027s impact in USAID\u0027s Zika response: (1) apply mosquito repellent, (2) use condoms during pregnancy, (3) remove standing water, (4) cover water storage containers, (5) clean/remove mosquito eggs from water containers, (6) seek antenatal care, and (7) seek family planning counseling. This case study documents a flexible process that can be adapted to inform the prioritization of behaviors when there is limited evidence available, as during many emergency responses.","publish_time":"2019-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinchoff, Jessie; Serino, Arianna; Merritt, Alice Payne; Hunter, Gabrielle; Silva, Martha; Parikh, Priya; Hewett, Paul C.","journal":"Glob Health Sci Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c313555924b8f0f82f082673f42b56ef736c20a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6816817.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-19-00188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States Agency for International Development","USAID","SBC"],"locations":["Latin America","Caribbean"],"keyphrases":["Zika transmission","Zika infection","Zika outbreak","USAID\u0027s Zika response","prioritization of behaviors","list of behaviors","variants of preventive behaviors","set of focus behaviors","behavior change","evidence-based process","water containers","plethora of behavior","high potential","highest potential","coordinated response","partners","limited evidence available","review of seminal papers","standing water","flexible process","review of gray literature","cover water storage containers","behavior\u0027s potential effectiveness","Aedes aegypti population","programming efforts","mosquito eggs","mosquito repellent","target population","SBC programming\u0027s impact","harmonizing prevention efforts","relevant published articles","Google Scholar","extraction","United States Agency","systematic keyword searches","International Development","Caribbean","Latin America","necessary materials","accessibility","diseases","consensus","use condoms","contextual factors","pregnancy","cost","year","case study","situation","messages","emergency responses","family planning counseling","assessment criteria","setting","feasibility","antenatal care","frequency"],"language":"en"},

This paper reviews the methods used in predicting, designing, and analyzing air distributions in the cabins, among which experimental measurements and numerical simulations are the two popular ones. The experimental measurements have usually been seen as more reliable although they are more expensive and time consuming. Most of the numerical simulations use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) that can provide effectively detailed information. Numerous applications using the two methods can be found in the literature for studying air distributions in aircraft cabins, including investigations on more reliable and accurate models. The review in the paper shows that the studies using both experimental measurements and computer simulations are becoming popular. And it is necessary to use a full-scale test rig to obtain reliable and high quality experimental data.

METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: A period of 7\u201313 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course.

We investigated the association of initial radiologic characteristics obtained at admission with clinical outcomes in patients with avian influenza H7N9 pneumonia. METHODS: Demographics, comorbidities, clinical findings, radiologic appearance and scores of the affected lung parenchyma were compared between survivor group (n = 15) and mortality group (n = 7). Two radiologic scores were calculated, one using chest radiography and one using CT. Follow-up CT scans at discharge were analyzed in 12 patients of the survival group. RESULTS: All the patients in mortality group developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation, while in the survival group 33% (5/15) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (P\u003C0.05) and 27% (4/15) required mechanical ventilation (P\u003C0.05). The mean radiographic and CT scores of the mortality group were 50% higher compared to the survival group (P\u003C0.05).

However, only in Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, and Mexico have found antibodies in VEEV in bats, using immunohistochemistry, the sensitivity and specificity are improved; thus, it is better for demonstrating natural infection in bats as potential hosts. This study aimed to determine the presence of VEEV in tissues of frugivorous bats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective descriptive cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sampling was carried out in 12 localities of C\u00F3rdoba and Sucre area of the Colombian Caribbean. Two hundred and eighty-six bats were captured using fog nets, and the specimens according to taxonomic keys were classified. According to the Ethics Committee of the University of C\u00F3rdoba, the bats were treated with analgesics and anesthetics. Blood samples were taken and then euthanized to obtain tissues and organs which were preserved in liquid N2 at \u2212196\u00B0C. A portion of each organ was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for the detection of antigens by immunohistochemistry. Several pathological anatomy analyses were performed to determine the histological characteristics of tissue lesions of frugivorous bats naturally infected with the VEEV. RESULTS: Of the 286 bats captured, 23 species were identified. In samples of the brain, spleen, and lung of two frugivorous bats (2/286=0.70%) Artibeus planirostris and Sturnira lilium, the presence of VEEV was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: A fragment of the nsP4 non-structural protein gene corresponding to the alphavirus was amplified. Two samples were positive (2/286=0.70%) in frugivorous bats; A. planirostris (code GenBank: MG820274) and S. lilium (code GenBank: MG820275).

In the current study, we carried out yeast two-hybrid assays to screen human proteins that could interact with 3A protein of EV71. Human \u03B23 subunit of Na\u002B/K\u002B-ATPase (ATP1B3) protein was demonstrated to interact with the 3A protein of EV71. Although 3A protein had no effect on the expression of ATP1B3, EV71 infection resulted in elevated expression of ATP1B3 in RD cell line, both on messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Interestingly, knockdown of ATP1B3 could significantly increase the replication of EV71, whereas overexpression of ATP1B3 significantly suppressed the replication of EV71 in RD cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression of ATP1B3 could induce the production of type-I interferons. Our study demonstrated that ATP1B3 inhibit EV71 replication by enhancing the production of type-I interferons, which could act as a potential therapeutic target in EV71 infection.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Yanfang; Hou, Hongyan; Wang, Feng; Qiao, Long; Wang, Xiong; Yu, Jing; Liu, Weiyong; Sun, Ziyong","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4d9702a9579207acbd9578846bb4ab9b1a59e80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127048.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216301222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240146/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216301222; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.05.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein of EV71","EV71 infection","replication of EV71","EV71 replication","overexpression of ATP1B3","knockdown of ATP1B3","elevated expression of ATP1B3","protein levels","production of type","interferons","RD cells","human proteins","current study","RD cell line","Human \u03B23 subunit of Na","messenger RNA","yeast","hybrid assays","mRNA","potential therapeutic target","severe diseases","Abstract Enterovirus","ATPase","effect","children"],"language":"en"},

Historically this was measured using plaque assays, or Culture Enhanced Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (CE-ELISA). Objectives: to develop and characterise real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to measure influenza A and B viral load in clinical samples, that offer improvements over existing methods, in particular virus infectivity assays. Study design: The dynamic range and robustness were established for the real time qPCR assays along with stability of the assay components. Cross validation of the real time PCR assays with CE-ELISA was performed by parallel testing of both serial dilutions of three different subtypes of cultured virus and a panel of influenza positive throat swab specimens. Results: the assays were specific for influenza A and B and the dynamic ranges were at least seven logs. The assay variability was within acceptable limits but increased towards the lower limit of quantification, which was 3.33 log10 viral cDNA copies/ml of virus transport medium (ten viral RNA copies/PCR). The components of the assay were robust enough to withstand extended storage and several freeze\u2013thaw cycles. For the real time PCR assays the limit of quantification was equivalent to the virus infectivity cut off, which equates to a 93-fold increase in sensitivity. Conclusion: Well characterised real time PCR assays offer significant improvements over the existing methods for measuring the viral load of strains of influenza A and B in clinical specimens.","publish_time":"2004-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ward, C.

Six RT-LAMP primers were designed from the same conserved region of RT-nPCR, and the assay was run at 63\u00B0C for one hour. Results were evaluated through both agarose gel run and hydroxynapthol blue (HNB) dye and then compared with RT-nPCR results for the assessment of sensitivity and specificity. The overall specificity was 100%, but the sensitivity was 50% and 54.5% for agarose gel and HNB respectively.

Etiologic diagnosis of pharyngitis is only important in Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u03B2-hemolytic streptococcal infections because antibiotic therapy is mandatory to prevent further complications, especially acute rheumatic fever. Diagnosis has classically been based on bacterial isolation from throat swabs. There are no standardized methods for this culture in terms of culture medium, incubation atmosphere or the identification tests to be performed. Currently, a large number of commercial reagents are available, which, through different immunological techniques, allow direct antigen detection in the clinical sample. Most of these products show good sensitivity and specificity values, with the added advantage of providing a rapid result, especially if they are performed at points of care. Many guidelines for the management of patients with pharyngitis and tonsillitis are available. Nevertheless, as antigen detection results can vary in each center according to the indications and the care taken in sample extraction, the method chosen should be evaluated before implementation.","publish_time":"2008-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matas, Lurdes; M\u00E9ndez, Mar\u00EDa; Rodrigo, Carlos; Ausina, Vicente","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d24fd48cc330eb85314023a6e89a7baca4e8d27.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X08765777; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X08765777","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["in terms of","the indications and the care taken in sample extraction","for the management of patients with pharyngitis and tonsillitis","Etiologic diagnosis of pharyngitis","Tonsillitis and pharyngitis","allow direct antigen detection in the clinical sample","with the added advantage of providing a rapid result","performed at points of care","large number of commercial reagents","incubation atmosphere or the identification tests","highly frequent infections in Spain with multiple","only important in Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u03B2","Most of these products show good sensitivity and specificity","available","be performed","ant\u00EDgeno","medio de aislamiento","the method chosen should be evaluated before implementation","as antigen detection results can vary in each center according","especially if they","especially acute rheumatic fever","faringoamigadalitis causadas","t\u00E9cnica de detecci\u00F3n","muestra cl\u00EDnica","diagn\u00F3stico etiol\u00F3gico","hemolytic streptococcal infections","standardized methods for","prevent further complications","antibiotic therapy","classically been based on bacterial isolation from throat swabs","medium","through different immunological","which","estreptococo betahemol\u00EDtico","atm\u00F3sfera de incubaci\u00F3n","Nevertheless","inter\u00E9s","Many","indicaciones","especificidad","pruebas m\u00EDnimas","atenci\u00F3n","cuidado","t\u00E9cnicas inmunol\u00F3gicas","cultivos","grupo","Currently","buenos valores de sensibilidad","m\u00FAltiples reactivos","complicaciones","ventaja","realizaci\u00F3n","estrategias","funci\u00F3n","identificaci\u00F3n","infecci\u00F3n","rendimiento","obtenci\u00F3n","pacientes","There","m\u00E9todo estandarizado","etiolog\u00EDa","misma consulta m\u00E9dica","centro","fiebre reum\u00E1tica","resultado r\u00E1pido","exudado far\u00EDngeo","faringoamigdalitis","resultados","mercado","protocolos","mayor\u00EDa","caso","antibi\u00F3ticos"],"language":"es"},

METHODS: Patients admitted to the pediatric unit of Konyang University Hospital for lower respiratory tract disease between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014 and who underwent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests were examined. The patients were divided into those with increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and those with normal ALT or AST levels. Further, patients with increased ALT and AST levels were individually compared with patients in the normal group, and the blood test results were compared according to the type of respiratory virus. RESULTS: Patients with increased ALT or AST levels had one more day of hospital stay, on average, compared with patients in the normal group (5.3\u00B13.1 days vs. 4.4\u00B13.0 days, p=0.019). Patients in the increased ALT level group were younger and had a longer mean hospital stay, compared with patients in the normal group (p=0.022 and 0.003, respectively). The incidences of increased ALT or AST were the highest in adenovirus infections (6/24, 25.0%), followed by enterovirus (2/11, 18.2%) and respiratory syncytial virus A (21/131, 16.0%) infections. CONCLUSION: Nonspecific reactive hepatitis is more common among patients with adenovirus, enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infection, as well as among those infected at a younger age. Compared with AST levels, ALT levels are better indicators of the severity of nonspecific reactive hepatitis.","publish_time":"2016-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oh, Jun Suk; Choi, Jun Sik; Lee, Young Hyuk; Ko, Kyung Og; Lim, Jae Woo; Cheon, Eun Jung; Lee, Gyung Min; Yoon, Jung Min","journal":"Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24d4cd7729a8df22c9cab12f20e96aa9bf1332a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5234413.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28090469/; https://doi.org/10.5223/pghn.2016.19.4.243","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Konyang University Hospital","ALT","AST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ALT levels","AST levels","pediatric patients","normal ALT","incidences of increased ALT","increased ALT level group","normal group","respiratory virus infection","increased levels of alanine aminotransferase","type of respiratory virus","respiratory syncytial virus infection","severity of nonspecific reactive hepatitis","clinical manifestations of nonspecific reactive hepatitis","lower respiratory tract disease","day of hospital","mean hospital","enterovirus","adenovirus infections","days","pediatric unit of Konyang University Hospital","aspartate aminotransferase","younger age","blood test results","better indicators","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests","relationship","average","CONCLUSION","METHODS","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, avian and other vertebrate species are a reservoir of type A influenza virus genome diversity, hosting strains representing at least 120 of 144 combinations of 16 viral hemagglutinin and 9 viral neuraminidase subtypes. Viral genome segment reassortments and mutations emerging within this reservoir may spawn new influenza virus strains as imminent epidemic or pandemic threats to human health and poultry production. Traditional methods to detect and differentiate influenza virus subtypes are either time-consuming and labor-intensive (culture-based) or remarkably insensitive (antibody-based). Molecular diagnostic assays based upon reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have short assay cycle time, and high analytical sensitivity and specificity. However, none of these diagnostic tests determine viral gene nucleotide sequences to distinguish strains and variants of a detected pathogen from one specimen to the next. Decision-quality, strain- and variant-specific pathogen gene sequence information may be critical for public health, infection control, surveillance, epidemiology, or medical/veterinary treatment planning. The Resequencing Pathogen Microarray (RPM-Flu) is a robust, highly multiplexed and target gene sequencing-based alternative to both traditional culture- or biomarker-based diagnostic tests. RPM-Flu is a single, simultaneous differential diagnostic assay for all subtype combinations of type A influenza viruses and for 30 other viral and bacterial pathogens that may cause influenza-like illness. These other pathogen targets of RPM-Flu may co-infect and compound the morbidity and/or mortality of patients with influenza. The informative specificity of a single RPM-Flu test represents specimen-specific viral gene sequences as determinants of virus type, A/HN subtype, virulence, host-range, and resistance to antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2010-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Metzgar, David; Myers, Christopher A.; Russell, Kevin L.; Faix, Dennis; Blair, Patrick J.; Brown, Jason; Vo, Scott; Swayne, David E.; Thomas, Colleen; Stenger, David A.; Lin, Baochuan; Malanoski, Anthony P.; Wang, Zheng; Blaney, Kate M.; Long, Nina C.; Schnur, Joel M.; Saad, Magdi D.; Borsuk, Lisa A.; Lichanska, Agnieszka M.; Lorence, Matthew C.; Weslowski, Brian; Schafer, Klaus O.; Tibbetts, Clark","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02783b0989ab6a54fd4af139d787b69b9d9d009e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2815781.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20140251/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008995","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus subtypes","viral subtypes","new influenza virus strains","influenza viruses","viral hemagglutinin","influenza virus genome diversity","viral neuraminidase subtypes","viral gene nucleotide sequences","influenza virus infections of humans","specimen-specific viral gene sequences","determinants of virus type","reservoir of type","pathogen targets of RPM","diagnostic tests","single RPM-Flu test","Viral genome segment reassortments","subtype combinations of type","detected pathogen","target gene sequencing-based alternative","variant-specific pathogen gene sequence information","hosting strains","simultaneous differential diagnostic assay","Molecular diagnostic assays","Resequencing Pathogen Microarray","traditional culture","cause","public health","human health","HN subtype","informative specificity","Traditional methods","short assay cycle time","imminent epidemic","pandemic threats","RT-PCR","reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","epidemiology","surveillance","infection control","high analytical sensitivity","host-range","vertebrate species","mutations","variants","poultry production","resistance","virulence","biomarker","veterinary treatment planning","morbidity","antiviral agents","contrast","mortality of patients","H1N1","bacterial pathogens","Decision-quality","decades","antibody","H3N2","illness"],"language":"en"},

An additional allotropic modification of oxygen, the cyclooctaoxygen, was predicted to exist in 1990. METHODS: Cyclooctaoxygen sodium was synthesized in vitro from atmospheric oxygen, or catalase effect-generated oxygen, under catalysis of cytosine nucleosides and either ninhydrin or eukaryotic low-molecular weight RNA. Thin-layer chromatographic mobility shift assays were applied on specific nucleic acids and the cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex. RESULTS: We report the first synthesis and characterization of cyclooctaoxygen as its sodium crown complex, isolated in the form of three cytosine nucleoside hydrochloride complexes. The cationic cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex is shown to bind to nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), to associate with single-stranded DNA and spermine phosphate, and to be essentially non-toxic to cultured mammalian cells at 0.1\u20131.0 mM concentration. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that cyclooctaoxygen is formed in most eukaryotic cells in vivo from dihydrogen peroxide in a catalase reaction catalyzed by cytidine and RNA. A molecular biological model is deduced for a first epigenetic shell of eukaryotic in vivo DNA. This model incorporates an epigenetic explanation for the interactions of the essential micronutrient selenium (as selenite) with eukaryotic in vivo DNA. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Since the sperminium phosphate/cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex is calculated to cover the active regions (2.6%) of bovine lymphocyte interphase genome, and 12.4% of murine enterocyte mitotic chromatin, we propose that the sperminium phosphate/cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex coverage of nucleic acids is essential to eukaryotic gene regulation and promoted proto-eukaryotic evolution.","publish_time":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kesel, Andreas J.; Day, Craig W.; Montero, Catherine M.; Schinazi, Raymond F.","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/557afcf709d72d44561359d14bf2d5f8e6840b3d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/379dbfef76fdfee936a9ccbaaaaca2a89f11c49c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bbfc4b79333018c0135f55544f7fddd5b8f1018a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4780752.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26825775/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4780752?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304416516300083; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416516300083; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.01.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cationic cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex","characterization of cyclooctaoxygen","cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex coverage of nucleic acids","sodium crown complex","eukaryotic cells","epigenetic shell of eukaryotic","eukaryotic gene regulation","proto-eukaryotic evolution","eukaryotic low-molecular weight RNA","sperminium phosphate","atmospheric oxygen","specific nucleic acids","spermine phosphate","catalase effect-generated oxygen","additional allotropic modification of oxygen","single-stranded DNA","molecular biological model","catalase reaction","epigenetic explanation","mammalian cells","catalysis of cytosine nucleosides","essential micronutrient selenium","solid allotropic modifications","cytosine nucleoside hydrochloride complexes","ninhydrin","form","layer chromatographic mobility shift assays","interactions","dihydrogen peroxide","selenite","bovine lymphocyte interphase genome","murine enterocyte mitotic chromatin","synthesis","cytidine","GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE","active regions","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","concentration","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Yonghua","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e8c2653db450cf88658c723b94f826db4f4e26b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7bdceb3b947ec934199d0c97fb9ec5a0e2bac776.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.975995","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","phenotypic convergence","SARS-related CoV clades","spike protein","strong adaptive evolutionary convergence","possible co-evolutionary convergence","COVID","RBD protein sequences","partner protein","observed bat SARS","nCoV","related coronaviruses","evolutionary convergent RBD sequence","molecular basis","receptor binding domain","human host receptor ACE2","high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites","molecular phyloecological approach","Coronavirus Disease","capable of infecting human hosts","potential new coronavirus sources","ORF3a","CoVs","phylogenetic uniting","severe acute respiratory syndrome","humans","pathological features","adaptation","significant Darwinian selection","branches","enzyme","results","genome-level analyses","identical receptors","angiotensin","future","examination","addition"],"language":"en"},

A mechanism has been proposed by which the peptide, being positioned on the surface of the cell membrane, inhibits its fusion with the virus. In the present work, peptide\u2013lipid interactions of C8 with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes are investigated using electron spin resonance spectroscopy of spin-labelled lipids. Three other peptides, obtained from modifications of C8, have also been investigated, in an attempt to clarify the essential molecular features of the interactions involving the tryptophan residues. The results show that C8 adsorbs strongly on the bilayer surface. Membrane binding requires not only the presence of the Trp residues in the sequence, but also their common orientation on one side of the peptide that is engendered by the WX(2) WX(2) W motif. Membrane interaction correlates closely with peptide antiviral activity, indicating that the membrane is essential in stabilizing the peptide conformation that will be able to inhibit viral infection.","publish_time":"2009-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u2019Errico, Gerardino; Vitiello, Giuseppe; D\u2019Ursi, Anna Maria; Marsh, Derek","journal":"Eur Biophys J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/501a57b3b0e0a5154507b25e23a3f34bf6d2299d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2728064.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00249-009-0454-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19415263/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIV","Trp"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Trp residues","peptide antiviral activity","peptide conformation","Membrane interaction","cell membrane","Membrane binding","Gly-Trp","Ac-Trp","Trp-Val","modifications of C8","lipid interactions of C8","FIV","membrane-proximal external region","tryptophan residues","WX","potent antiviral activity","bilayer surface","electron spin resonance spectroscopy of spin","feline immunodeficiency virus","essential molecular features","tryptophan-rich octapeptide","gp36 glycoprotein ectodomain","dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes","Glu-Asp","labelled lipids","sequence","present work","presence","Ile-NH","attempt","fusion","common orientation","viral infection","W motif","peptides","results","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

The majority of the world\u0027s population is susceptible to pathological, infectious disease whose life cycles are sensitive to environmental factors across different physical phases including air, water and soil. Nearly all so-called neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) fall into this category, meaning that future geographic patterns of transmission of dozens of infections are likely to be affected by climate change over the short (seasonal), medium (annual) and long (decadal) term. This review offers an introduction into the terms and processes deployed in modelling climate change and reviews the state of the art in terms of research into how climate change may affect future transmission of NTDs. The 34 infections included in this chapter are drawn from the WHO NTD list and the WHO blueprint list of priority diseases. For the majority of infections, some evidence is available of which environmental factors contribute to the population biology of parasites, vectors and zoonotic hosts.

We analysed four years (2012\u20132015) of daily bovine transports to assess the risk of disease transmission and identify times and locations where monitoring would be most effective. Specifically, we investigated how the seasonal dynamics of transport networks, driven by the alpine summering and traditional cattle markets, affect the risk of epidemic outbreaks. RESULTS: We found strong and consistent seasonal variation in several structural network measures as well as in measures for outbreak risk. Analysis of the consequences of excluding markets, dealers and alpine pastures from the network shows that markets contribute much more to the overall outbreak risk than alpine summering. Static descriptors of monthly transport networks were poor predictors of outbreak risk emanating from individual holdings; a dynamic measure, which takes the temporal structure of the network into account, gave better risk estimates. A stochastic simulation suggests that targeted surveillance based on this dynamic network allows a higher detection rate and smaller outbreak size at detection than compared to other sampling schemes. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic measures based on time-stamped data\u2014the outgoing contact chain\u2014can give better risk estimates and could help to improve surveillance schemes. Using this measure we find evidence that even in a country with intense summering practice, markets continue being the prime risk factor for the spread of contagious diseases.","publish_time":"2018-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vidondo, Beatriz; Voelkl, Bernhard","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4208f9c98e378d4959debc3ba361e9cc6972e814.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5851077.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1406-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29534711/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overall outbreak risk","dynamic network","better risk estimates","risk of epidemic outbreaks","prime risk factor","risk of disease transmission","poor predictors of outbreak risk emanating","Dynamic measures","structural network measures","alpine summering","intricate network of transports","consequences of excluding markets","smaller outbreak size","traditional cattle markets","alpine pastures","spread of epidemic diseases","surveillance schemes","seasonal dynamics of transport networks","intense summering practice","spread of contagious diseases","targeted surveillance","sampling schemes","Static descriptors of monthly transport networks","higher detection rate","consistent seasonal variation","daily bovine transports","time-stamped data","outgoing contact chain","individual holdings","dealers","account","locations","times","potential substrate","animals","country","temporal structure","monitoring","stochastic simulation","Analysis","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Livestock herds","RESULTS","evidence","years"],"language":"en"},

Hybridization with radioisotopic-labelled probes in higher formamide concentrations (up to 60%) increased the detection signals, possibly by reducing reassociation of the probe. Significant detection amplification (30\u201350 times) was achieved in the case of biotinylated probes by stimulation of hyperpolymer formation on already hybridized target sequences, by additional hybridization with biotinylated pUC-19. A detection amplification was also obtained when hybridization was done with two probes (pBC-52 and pBC-247), containing non-overlapping viral sequences. Although the detectability was surpassed by biotinylated probes, sensitivity was superior in radioisotopic virus detection.","publish_time":"1988-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verbeek, Arnold; Tijssen, Peter","journal":"Molecular and Cellular Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bee5f322a61fb7733dcf69638cac5d05708e1f7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0890850888900059; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0890850888900059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA","radioisotopic virus detection","RNA fixation","virus cDNA","isolated genomic RNA","radioisotopic-labelled probes","case of biotinylated probes","genomic RNA templates","virus particles","detection signals","Significant detection amplification","additional hybridization","biotinylated pUC","non-infected HRT","non-overlapping viral sequences","biotinylated recombinant plasmids","cells","SSC","pBC","supernatant of infected HRT","Abstract cDNA","hybridized target sequences","stimulation of hyperpolymer formation","nucleic acid","bovine coronavirus","sensitivity","plasmid DNA","BCV","pg","higher formamide concentrations","baking","reassociation","times","Denaturation","nitrocellulose membranes","proteinase","blots","vacuum","small quantities","homology","detectability","treatment"],"language":"en"},

Following a widespread infection in the human population in Norway, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was introduced to the influenza A na\u00EFve Norwegian pig population, and within a few months pigs in more than one third of Norwegian swine herds had antibodies against the virus. A cross-sectional study was performed on all swine nucleus and multiplier herds in Norway to analyze risk factors for introduction of infection, and the preventive effects of recommended biosecurity practices. A surveillance program provided information on infection status of the study herds, and a questionnaire was administered to all 118 nucleus and multiplier herds to collect information on herd variables. The surveillance program revealed that pigs in 42% of the herds had antibodies against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The incidence of serologically positive pigs was similar in both multiplier herds (41%) and closed nucleus herds (43%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that presence of farm staff with influenza-like illness (ILI) (OR=4.15, CI 1.5\u201311.4, p =0.005) and herd size (OR=1.01, CI 1\u20131.02, p =0.009) were risk factors for infection.

In the US, the first PEDV outbreaks occurred in 2013 and since then US PEDV strains have quickly spread throughout the US and worldwide, causing significant economic and public health concerns. Currently two conditionally approved vaccines exist in the US, but there is no live attenuated vaccine, which is considered the best option in controlling PEDV by inducing transferrable mucosal immunity to susceptible neonatal piglets. In this study, we passaged an US PEDV isolate under various conditions to generate three strains and characterized their growth and antigenicity in cell culture using various assays including Western blot analysis, serum neutralization assay, sequencing analysis and confocal microscopy. Finally, these strains were evaluated for pathogenicity in nursing piglets (1\u20134 days old). RESULTS: One of the PEDV strains generated in this study (designated as PEDV 8aa) is able to replicate in cells without any protease and grows to a high titer of \u003E8 log(10) TCID(50)/ml in cell culture. Interestingly, replication of PEDV 8aa was severely reduced by trypsin and this correlated with the inhibition of virus attachment and entry into the cells. In neonatal nursing piglets, PEDV 8aa (passage number 70 or 105) was found to be fully attenuated with limited virus shedding. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that applying selective pressure during viral passages can facilitate attainment of viral attenuation and that PEDV 8aa warrants further investigation as an attenuated vaccine.","publish_time":"2017-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yunjeong; Oh, Changin; Shivanna, Vinay; Hesse, Richard A.; Chang, Kyeong-Ok","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e536891c4d89b74cea0ed4788fc8e3bff5a6787.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5702120.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29178878/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1283-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["US PEDV strains","replication of PEDV","PEDV outbreaks","neonatal nursing piglets","susceptible neonatal piglets","aa warrants","cell culture","study","cells","live attenuated vaccine","RESULTS","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","inhibition of virus attachment","limited virus shedding","sequencing analysis","various assays","viral passages","various conditions","Western blot analysis","attainment of viral attenuation","serum neutralization assay","transferrable mucosal immunity","antigenicity","death","older pigs","investigation","confocal microscopy","selective pressure","public health concerns","extreme dehydration","entry","BACKGROUND","growth","coronavirus","passage number","log","high titer","protease","intestinal tract","best option","mortality","pathogenicity","days old","trypsin","approved vaccines","TCID","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiological studies of idiopathic human cancers indicate that additional tumor viruses remain to be discovered. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled systematic screenings of human tumor transcriptomes for viral transcripts. However, technical problems such as low abundances of viral transcripts in large volumes of sequencing data, viral sequence divergence, and homology between viral and human factors significantly confound identification of tumor viruses. We have developed a novel computational approach for detecting viral transcripts in human cancers that takes the aforementioned confounding factors into account and is applicable to a wide variety of viruses and tumors. We apply the approach to conducting the first systematic search for viruses in neuroblastoma, the most common cancer in infancy. The diverse clinical progression of this disease as well as related epidemiological and virological findings are highly suggestive of a pathogenic cofactor. However, a viral etiology of neuroblastoma is currently contested. We mapped [Image: see text] transcriptomes of neuroblastoma as well as positive and negative controls to the human and all known viral genomes in order to detect both known and unknown viruses. Analysis of controls, comparisons with related methods, and statistical estimates demonstrate the high sensitivity of our approach. Detailed investigation of putative viral transcripts within neuroblastoma samples did not provide evidence for the existence of any known human viruses. Likewise, de-novo assembly and analysis of chimeric transcripts did not result in expression signatures associated with novel human pathogens. While confounding factors such as sample dilution or viral clearance in progressed tumors may mask viral cofactors in the data, in principle, this is rendered less likely by the high sensitivity of our approach and the number of biological replicates analyzed. Therefore, our results suggest that frequent viral cofactors of metastatic neuroblastoma are unlikely.","publish_time":"2013-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schelhorn, Sven-Eric; Fischer, Matthias; Tolosi, Laura; Altm\u00FCller, Janine; N\u00FCrnberg, Peter; Pfister, Herbert; Lengauer, Thomas; Berthold, Frank","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5cd1a73534959eff5332bcd3e5bc012f38c9137.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3789765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098097/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003228","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral clearance","viral etiology of neuroblastoma","known human viruses","human factors","known viral genomes","low abundances of viral transcripts","viral sequence divergence","frequent viral cofactors of metastatic neuroblastoma","Detailed investigation of putative viral transcripts","human cancer incidents","novel human pathogens","transcriptomes of neuroblastoma","unknown viruses","additional tumor viruses","identification of tumor viruses","systematic screenings of human tumor transcriptomes","neuroblastoma samples","Epidemiological studies of idiopathic human cancers","analysis of chimeric transcripts","wide variety of viruses","novel computational approach","aforementioned confounding factors","Analysis of controls","text","high sensitivity","Image","large volumes of sequencing data","sequencing technology","progressed tumors","related methods","systematic search","negative controls","common cancer","pathogenic cofactor","homology","statistical estimates","sample dilution","expression signatures","disease","account","comparisons","de-novo assembly","virological findings","evidence","order","existence","technical problems","Recent advances","number of biological replicates","diverse clinical progression","principle","results","infancy","excess"],"language":"en"},

Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer\u2019s instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples. AmpSeq accurately detected and genotyped both IBV lineages in three of five samples containing two IBV lineages. Additionally, one sample contained three IBV lineages, and AmpSeq accurately detected two of the three. Strain identification, including detection of different strains from the same lineage, was also possible with this AmpSeq method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MinION-based AmpSeq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of IBV from oral swab samples.","publish_time":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butt, Salman L.; Erwood, Eric C.; Zhang, Jian; Sellers, Holly S.; Young, Kelsey; Lahmers, Kevin K.; Stanton, James B.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5ade4011089cd4758eb9978bd8c88cd80c5bf67.json; document_parses/pdf_json/00d16927588fb04d4be0e6b269fc02f0d3c2aa7b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/634600","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["IBV","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV lineages","IBV-positive samples","typed IBV","cultured IBV","clinical samples","pooling of samples","MinION-based AmpSeq method","oral swab samples","choanal cleft swab samples","infectious bronchitis virus","Control of infectious bronchitis","S1 subunit","D MinION sequencing library","universal S1 PCR","accurate identification","Strain identification","modified S1-targeted primers","Sanger sequencing","multiple isolates","mixed isolates","significant economic losses","tracheal scrapings","causative agent","genotyping","efficient means","genetic diversity","manufacturer\u2019s instructions","global poultry industry","immunologic characterization","detection of different strains","serotypes","complete serologic cross-protection","feasibility","spike gene","definition","IBVs","paper","Total RNA","emergence","results","Amplicons"],"language":"en"},

Goat anti-turkey IgG (H\u002BL) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as detector antibody. Three hundred and twenty two turkey sera from the field were used to evaluate the performance of ELISA and determine the cut-off point of ELISA. The established ELISA was also examined with serum samples obtained from turkeys experimentally infected with TCoV.

The optimum conditions for differentiation between anti-TCoV hyperimmune serum and normal turkey serum were recombinant TCoV N protein concentration at 20\u03BCg/ml, serum dilution at 1:800, and conjugate dilution at 1:10,000. Of the 322 sera from the field, 101 were positive for TCoV by immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA). The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA relative to IFA test were 86.0% and 96.8%, respectively, using the optimum cut-off point of 0.2 as determined by logistic regression method. Reactivity of anti-rotavirus, anti-reovirus, anti-adenovirus, or anti-enterovirus antibodies with the recombinant N protein coated on the ELISA plates was not detected.

An early concern of the program was the lack of a standardized diagnostic tool to monitor infection in dogs, a key target of control programs. Under this premise, we have developed a new copro-ELISA test after extensive screening of a large panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal sera, which performs with high standards of sensitivity (92.6%) and specificity (86.4%) as established by necropsy diagnosis of dogs. The key component of the test, MAbEg9 has a convenient IgG isotype and reacts with a periodate-resistant epitope found in high molecular weight components of the worm. Time-course analysis of experimentally infected dogs showed that even animals with a very low number of parasites could be detected as early as day 20 post infection. The test was formulated in a ready-to-use kit format with proven stability of each component for a minimum of 3 months at room temperature.

Both Cyp and FKBP have peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. However, protein interacting with NIMA (Pin1), a member of the parvulin subfamily of PPIases that differs from Cyps and FKBPs, is essential for various signaling pathways.

Methods: We studied a total of 143 patients with COVID-19 from January 29 to February 29, 2020. Demographic and clinical data, laboratory data, including ultrasound scans of the lower extremities, and outcome variables were obtained, comparisons were made between DVT and non-DVT groups. Results: Of the 143 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (aged 63 \u00B1 14 years; 74 [51.7%] man), 66 patients developed lower extremity DVT (46.1%, included 23 [34.8%] with proximal DVT and 43 [65.2%] with distal DVT).Compared with patients who with no DVT, patients with DVT were older and had a lower oxygenation index, a higher rate of cardiac injury, and worse prognosis including an increased proportion of deaths (23 [34.8%] vs 9 [11.7%], P = 0.001) and a decreased proportion of patients discharged (32 [48.5%] vs 60 [77.9%], P \u003C 0.001). Multivariant analysis only showed an association between CURB-65 score 3-5 (OR = 6.122, P = 0.031), Padua prediction score \u2265 4 (OR = 4.016, P = 0.04), and D-dimer \u003E1.0 (\u03BCg/ml) (OR = 5.818, P \u003C 0.014) and DVT in this cohort, respectively. The combination of a CURB-65 score 3-5, a Padua prediction score \u2265 4, and D-dimer \u003E 1.0 (\u03BCg/ml) has a sensitivity of 88.52% and a specificity of 61.43% for screening for DVT. In the subgroup of patients with a Padua prediction score \u2265 4 and whose ultrasound scans were performed \u02C372 hours after admission, DVT was present in 18 (34.0%) of the subgroup receiving venous thromboembolism prophylaxis vs 35 (63.3%) in the nonprophylaxis group (P = 0.010). Conclusions: The prevalence of DVT is high and is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism may be protective in patients with a Padua protection score \u2265 4 after admission. Our data seem to suggest that COVID-19 is probably an additional risk factor for DVT in the hospitalized patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Li; Feng, Xiaokai; Zhang, Danqing; Jiang, Chunguo; Mei, Heng; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Cuihong; Li, Hong; Xia, Xiaoling; Kong, Shuangshuang; Liao, Jia; Jia, Huijun; Pang, Xueqin; Song, Yue; Tian, Ying; Wang, Bin; Wu, Chun; Yuan, Hongliang; Zhang, Yongxing; Li, Yuman; Sun, Wei; Zhang, Yanting; Zhu, Shuangshuang; Wang, Shuyuan; Xie, Yuji; Ge, Shuping; Zhang, Liming; Hu, Yu; Xie, Mingxing","journal":"Circulation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32421381/; https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.046702","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DVT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized patients","prevalence of DVT","distal DVT","proximal DVT","subgroup of patients","lower extremity DVT","non-DVT groups","COVID","decreased proportion of patients","Padua prediction score","Padua protection score","venous thromboembolism prophylaxis vs","lower extremities","laboratory data","ultrasound scans","clinical data","admission","D-dimer","\u03BCg","CURB","lower oxygenation index","worse prognosis","risk factors","additional risk factor","increased proportion of deaths","potential thromboprophylaxis strategies","large referral","higher rate of cardiac injury","deep vein thrombosis","hours","adverse outcomes","coronavirus disease","outcome variables","comparisons","association","treatment center","single institutional study","Background","total","Multivariant analysis","specificity","sensitivity","nonprophylaxis group","screening","combination","Conclusions","man","Methods","Results","cohort","years"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we demonstrated that A3G interacted with the HBV core protein (HBc) directly in co-transfected HepG2 cells using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. In addition, we further found that this interaction did not require other factors in vitro using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology on BIAcore 3000.

Increasing cases of Dengue and Japanese encephalitis virus in Asia, frequent outbreaks of Yellow fever virus in Africa and South America, and the ongoing spread of West Nile virus throughout the Americas, show the geographical burden of flavivirus diseases. Flavivirus infections are often indistinct from and confused with other febrile illnesses. Here we review the specificity of published primers, and describe a new universal primer pair that can detect a wide range of flaviviruses, including viruses from each of the recognised subgroups. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of 257 published full-length Flavivirus genomes revealed conserved regions not previously targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers, Flav100F and Flav200R were designed from these regions and used to generate an 800 base pair cDNA product. The region amplified encoded part of the methyltransferase and most of the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (NS5) coding sequence. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful using standard conditions with RNA from over 60 different flavivirus strains representing about 50 species. The cDNA from each virus isolate was sequenced then used in phylogenetic analyses and database searches to confirm the identity of the template RNA. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive testing has revealed the broad specificity of these primers.

In high burden TB countries nucleic acid based TB tests have been restricted to centralised laboratories and specialised research settings. Requirements such as a constant electrical supply, air conditioning and skilled, computer literate operators prevent implementation of such tests in many settings. Isothermal DNA amplification technologies permit the use of simpler, less energy intensive detection platforms more suited to low resource settings that allow the accurate diagnosis of a disease within a short timeframe. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is a rapid, low temperature isothermal DNA amplification reaction. We report here RPA-based detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) DNA in \u003C20 minutes at 39\u00B0C. Assays for two MTC specific targets were investigated, IS6110 and IS1081. When testing purified MTC genomic DNA, limits of detection of 6.25 fg (IS6110) and 20 fg (IS1081)were consistently achieved. When testing a convenience sample of pulmonary specimens from suspected TB patients, RPA demonstrated superior accuracy to indirect fluorescence microscopy. Compared to culture, sensitivities for the IS1081 RPA and microscopy were 91.4% (95%CI: 85, 97.9) and 86.1% (95%CI: 78.1, 94.1) respectively (n = 71). Specificities were 100% and 88.6% (95% CI: 80.8, 96.1) respectively. For the IS6110 RPA and microscopy sensitivities of 87.5% (95%CI: 81.7, 93.2) and 70.8% (95%CI: 62.9, 78.7) were obtained (n = 90). Specificities were 95.4 (95% CI: 92.3,98.1) and 88% (95% CI: 83.6, 92.4) respectively. The superior specificity of RPA for detecting tuberculosis was due to the reduced ability of fluorescence microscopy to distinguish Mtb complex from other acid fast bacteria. The rapid nature of the RPA assay and its low energy requirement compared to other amplification technologies suggest RPA-based TB assays could be of use for integration into a point-of-care test for use in resource constrained settings.","publish_time":"2014-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boyle, David S.; McNerney, Ruth; Teng Low, Hwee; Leader, Brandon Troy; P\u00E9rez-Osorio, Ailyn C.; Meyer, Jessica C.; O\u0027Sullivan, Denise M.; Brooks, David G.; Piepenburg, Olaf; Forrest, Matthew S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de4137cea11509b6caf359fd5c66a215a1e8390f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4138011.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25118698/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation","MTC","RPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IS6110 RPA","IS1081 RPA","RPA-based TB assays","RPA assay","superior specificity of RPA","RPA-based detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex","Isothermal DNA amplification technologies","low resource settings","microscopy sensitivities","low temperature isothermal DNA amplification reaction","high burden TB countries nucleic acid based TB tests","suspected TB patients","resource constrained settings","indirect fluorescence microscopy","purified MTC genomic DNA","limits of detection","low energy requirement","effective tests","use of simpler","diagnosing tuberculosis","Recombinase Polymerase Amplification","reduced ability of fluorescence microscopy","specialised research settings","fg","Specificities","energy intensive detection platforms","MTC specific targets","Mtb complex","superior accuracy","rapid nature","public health priority","acid fast bacteria","World Health Organisation","air conditioning","computer literate operators","implementation","constant electrical supply","convenience sample of pulmonary specimens","care test","centralised laboratories","accurate diagnosis","Improved access","disease","point","Requirements","integration","minutes","culture","short timeframe"],"language":"en"},

The outbreaks of Ebola viruses in 2014 represented the most serious Ebola epidemics in history and greatly threatened public health worldwide. The development of additional effective anti-Ebola therapeutic agents is therefore quite urgent. In this study, via high throughput screening of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, we identified that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, potently prevents the entry of Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, teicoplanin also has an inhibitory effect on transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles, with an IC(50) as low as 330 nm. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that teicoplanin is able to block the entry of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) envelope pseudotyped viruses as well. Teicoplanin derivatives such as dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin can also inhibit the entry of Ebola, MERS, and SARS viruses. Mechanistic studies showed that teicoplanin blocks Ebola virus entry by specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L, opening a novel avenue for the development of additional glycopeptides as potential inhibitors of cathepsin L-dependent viruses. Notably, given that teicoplanin has routinely been used in the clinic with low toxicity, our work provides a promising prospect for the prophylaxis and treatment of Ebola, MERS, and SARS virus infection.","publish_time":"2016-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Nan; Pan, Ting; Zhang, Junsong; Li, Qianwen; Zhang, Xue; Bai, Chuan; Huang, Feng; Peng, Tao; Zhang, Jianhua; Liu, Chao; Tao, Liang; Zhang, Hui","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebdc99b03d47e9b235e6b3f71a5032e5a4c221f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4861487.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m116.716100; http://www.jbc.org/content/291/17/9218.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26953343/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Ebola virus infection","outbreaks of Ebola viruses","teicoplanin blocks Ebola virus entry","treatment of Ebola","entry of Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses","SARS viruses","Teicoplanin derivatives","serious Ebola epidemics","MERS","SARS virus infection","dependent viruses","development of additional effective anti-Ebola therapeutic agents","entry of Middle East respiratory syndrome","replication-competent virus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","development of additional glycopeptides","high mortality","activity of cathepsin","low toxicity","severe hemorrhagic fever","potential inhibitors of cathepsin","high throughput screening of Food","Drug Administration-approved drugs","work","transcription","history","prophylaxis","promising prospect","novel avenue","Mechanistic studies","particles","dalbavancin","oritavancin","inhibitory effect","cytoplasm","clinic","study","humans","telavancin","glycopeptide antibiotic","public health","Comparative analysis","nm"],"language":"en"},

However, since oligomannose NLG are also found on some host proteins it is possible that treatment with antiviral lectins may trigger undesirable side effects. For other antiviral lectins such as concanavalin A, banana lectin and cyanovirin-N (CV-N), interactions between the lectin and as yet undescribed cellular moieties have been reported to induce undesirable side effects including secretion of inflammatory cytokines and activation of host T-cells. We show that GRFT, unlike CV-N, binds the surface of human epithelial and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) through an exclusively oligosaccharide-dependent interaction. In contrast to several other antiviral lectins however, GRFT treatment induces only minimal changes in secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by epithelial cells or human PBMC, has no measureable effect on cell viability and does not significantly upregulate markers of T-cell activation. In addition, GRFT appears to retain antiviral activity once bound to the surface of PBMC. Finally, RNA microarray studies show that, while CV-N and ConA regulate expression of a multitude of cellular genes, GRFT treatment effects only minimal alterations in the gene expression profile of a human ectocervical cell line. These studies indicate that GRFT has an outstanding safety profile with little evidence of induced toxicity, T-cell activation or deleterious immunological consequence, unique attributes for a natural product-derived lectin.","publish_time":"2011-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kouokam, Joseph Calvin; Huskens, Dana; Schols, Dominique; Johannemann, Andrew; Riedell, Shonna K.; Walter, Wendye; Walker, Janice M.; Matoba, Nobuyuki; O\u0027Keefe, Barry R.; Palmer, Kenneth E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24e8a04adeb7f1142768d4de1e10d8ac48afcd03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3149051.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21829638/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022635","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GRFT","PBMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GRFT treatment effects","CV-N","antiviral lectins","T-cell activation","human PBMC","cyanovirin-N","surface of PBMC","antiviral activity","activation of host T-cells","surface of human epithelial","epithelial cells","banana lectin","cell viability","natural product-derived lectins","human ectocervical cell line","secretion of inflammatory cytokines","markers of T","oligomannose NLG","dense clusters of oligomannose N-linked glycans","red algal lectin griffithsin","gene expression profile","surface envelope glycoproteins","minimal alterations","minimal changes","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","host proteins","outstanding safety profile","multitude of cellular genes","undescribed cellular moieties","RNA microarray studies","little evidence of induced toxicity","unique attributes","deleterious immunological consequence","chemokines","viruses","measureable effect","concanavalin","ConA","interactions","oligosaccharide-dependent interaction","contrast","addition"],"language":"en"},

Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those presented in the literature.

Faecal samples from puppies with (n=113) and without (n=56) acute diarrhoea were collected and screened for Canine Parvovirus (CPV), Canine Coronavirus (CCoV), Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, \u03B2-hemolytic Eschericha coli (hEC), Giardia spp., Toxocara spp., Cystoisospora spp., and Cyniclomyces guttulatus. One or more pathogens were detected in 86.5% of diarrhoeic puppies and in 77.8% of asymptomatic puppies. Significant positive associations were found between CPV and CCoV, CPV and Cystoisospora spp., Toxocara spp. and hEC, Giardia spp. and C. guttulatus. Only CPV and CCoV were significantly associated with diarrhoea, hEC with a subset of puppies that had diarrhoea and severe clinical signs. CPV was more prevalent in puppies under 3 months of age. Puppies from high-volume dog breeders were significantly at increased risk for CPV (OR 4.20), CCoV (OR 4.50) and Cystoisospora spp. (OR 3.60). CCoV occurred significantly more often in winter (OR 3.35), and CPV in winter (OR 3.78) and spring (OR 4.72) as compared to summer.

In this study, we developed a duplex reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (duplex-rtRAA) assay containing an internal control in a single closed tube for the detection of human RSV. The internal control in the amplification effectively eliminated false-negative results and ensured the accuracy of the duplex-rtRAA system. We first developed and evaluated a universal singleplex-rtRAA assay for RSV. The sensitivity of this assay for RSV was determined as 4.4 copies per reaction, and the specificity was 100%. Next, a duplex-rtRAA assay with an internal control was established. The sensitivity of the duplex-rtRAA assay approached 5.0 copies per reaction, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The two detection methods (singleplex-rtRAA and duplex-rtRAA) developed in this study were used to test 278 clinical specimens, and the results showed absolute consistency with RSV RT-qPCR analysis, demonstrating 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. These data indicate that the duplex-rtRAA has great potential for the rapid detection of RSV with a high sensitivity.

Frequent changes in the pattern of infection mechanisms and the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains among pathogens have weakened the current treatment regimen.

To cater to the need, analysis of protein interaction networks (PINs) has gained importance as one of the promising strategies. The present review aims to discuss various computational approaches to analyse the PINs in context to infectious diseases. Topology and modularity analysis of the network with their biological relevance, and the scenario till date about host\u2013pathogen and intra-pathogenic protein interaction studies were delineated.

These interactions are dynamic and frequently involve multiprotein complexes. In the past decade mass spectrometry based proteomics methods have reached sensitivities and high throughput compatibilities of genomics methods and now allow the reliable quantitation of proteins in complex samples from limited material. As proteomics provides essential information on the biologically active entity namely the protein, including its posttranslational modifications and its interactions with other proteins, it is an indispensable method in the virologist\u0027s toolbox. Here we review protein interactions during virus entry and compare classical biochemical methods to study entry with novel technically advanced quantitative proteomics techniques. We highlight the value of quantitative proteomics in mapping functional virus entry networks, discuss the benefits and limitations and illustrate how the methodology will help resolve unsettled questions in virus entry research in the future.","publish_time":"2016-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerold, Gisa; Bruening, Janina; Pietschmann, Thomas","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08cb9d14d2fa21a6153a9922d4ad896b992c88c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4914609.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26365680/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215300617; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.09.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215300617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein interactions","host proteins","virus entry research","Abstract Virus entry","secondary host protein","proteomics methods","viral surface proteins","mapping functional virus entry networks","host structures","host cells","coordinating virus binding","reliable quantitation of proteins","value of quantitative proteomics","advanced quantitative proteomics techniques","classical biochemical methods","high throughput compatibilities of genomics methods","sensitivities","novel","pivotal role","complex samples","past decade mass spectrometry","unsettled questions","lipids","essential information","indispensable method","limited material","uptake","active entity","carbohydrates","benefits","posttranslational modifications","virologist\u0027s toolbox","methodology","limitations","future","multiprotein complexes"],"language":"en"},

These data demonstrate that interaction of Alphacoronavirus spike proteins with tubulin supports S protein transport and incorporation into virus particles.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"R\u00FCdiger, Anna-Theresa; Mayrhofer, Peter; Ma-Lauer, Yue; Pohlentz, Gottfried; M\u00FCthing, Johannes; von Brunn, Albrecht; Schwegmann-We\u00DFels, Christel","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3b41989daa6eba33f6224f9555a07d398d05dd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111311.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.07.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216301854; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216301854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27479465/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spike protein distribution","host-cell","interaction of Alphacoronavirus spike proteins","Abstract Coronavirus spike proteins","Virus replication","virus entry","Alphacoronavirus spike cytoplasmic domains","partial co-localization of TGEV spike proteins","host cell cytosol","authentic host cell \u03B2-tubulin","release of infectious virus particles","tubulin alpha","porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV","S protein transport","human coronavirus","NL63","changes","reduction","incorporation","place","attachment","drug-induced microtubule depolymerization","amino acid","endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment","assembly","beta chains","addition","data","virions","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In this retrospective three-centers study, 372 non-severe COVID-19 patients during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. Based on baseline data of the two groups, we constructed a risk prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluated its performance. RESULTS: The training cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19. We found that old age, and higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, direct bilirubin, lower albumin, are associated with severe COVID-19. We generated the nomogram for early identifying severe COVID-19 in the training cohort (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978], sensitivity 85.71%, specificity 87.58%); in validation cohort (0.853 [0.790-0.916], 77.5%, 78.4%). The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit. CONCLUSION: Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gong, Jiao; Ou, Jingyi; Qiu, Xueping; Jie, Yusheng; Chen, Yaqiong; Yuan, Lianxiong; Cao, Jing; Tan, Mingkai; Xu, Wenxiong; Zheng, Fang; Shi, Yaling; Hu, Bo","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80ca443bf2607ba42c7cd70ec31ec918d2feb9fd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296824/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa443","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-severe COVID","probability of severe COVID","early treatment of severe patients","non-severe state","non-severe group","critical COVID","severe coronavirus disease","risk prediction nomogram","training cohort","early identification of cases","high risk of progression","Decision curve","calibration curve","admission","clinical impact curve analysis","reliable risk stratification tool","high clinical net benefit","blood urea nitrogen","independent validation cohorts","red blood cell distribution width","coefficient of variation","higher serum lactate dehydrogenase","C-reactive protein","direct bilirubin","lower albumin","optimal agreement","better centralized management","centers study","old age","groups","effective model","actual observation","retrospective","AUC","clinicians","hospitalization","sensitivity","baseline data","specificity","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","METHODS","days","performance"],"language":"en"},

The method to detect virus make this approach difficult to study. Epstein\u2013Barr Virus (EBV) infection usually occurs in early childhood and can persist in palatine and pharyngeal tonsil lymphocytes. EBV has been closely associated with the undifferentiated form of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in its effect. Nevertheless, the presence of EBV in non-neoplastic lymphoid tissue of the nasopharynx and tonsil has rarely been investigated. Our objective was to study the frequency of EBV in tonsils and adenoids and to define the correlation between EBV and adenoid hyperplasia. In this study, we looked for EBV in adenoid and tonsil tissue of 165 patients (2 and 15 years old ) by in situ hybridization (ISH) for EBER 1/2 RNA. Resection of the adenoids was done for relief of upper respiratory tract obstruction, and the tonsils were resected because of recurrent tonsillitis and/or hyperplasia with upper airway obstruction. We divided the adenoid samples in two groups: one group 12\u201324 months old (average 18 months old) and the second group, 25 months to 15 years old. Tonsils were obtained from 85 patients, 3\u201313 years old (mean age 5.6 years) who underwent surgery due to recurrent tonsillitis or hyperplasia. EBV was demonstrated in lymphoid cells of 11 (34.3%) out of 32 adenoids for the first group and 36 (72%) out of 48 children of the second group. EBV was found in the respiratory epithelial cells of adenoid in one case. Children under 24 months of age can be infected by EBV, and this virus might be responsible for obstructive hyperplasia. Tonsils are less affected by EBV than the adenoids, suggesting that the EBV is more attracted to the adenoid tissue than the tonsillar tissue.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Endo, L.

Abstract Community-acquired pneumonias are major causes of hospitalization and death. Immediate assessment of severity, based on accurate clinical criteria, is an important step for rapid intensive care management and control of organ failures. Appropriate microbiological sampling should be performed prior to the antimicrobial therapy that should be initiated promptly after the diagnostic. Despite identification techniques, only 50% of community-acquired pneumonia cases are documented. Antibiotherapy is initially empirical. The goal is to provide optimal therapy for the most commonly identified causes of lethal pneumonia: extracellular and intracellular pathogens. A therapeutic regimen with a \u03B2-lactam combined with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone is recommended. This combination should be always active against pneumococci. Despite increased pneumococcal penicillin resistance, the recent recommendations are not modified. Respiratory fluoroquinolones may be an alternative in case of major increase of pneumococcal resistance to \u03B2-lactams. In some special populations, with regard to underlying structural disease of the lung and other risk factors, Pseudomonas aeruginosa must be taken into account. The severity of some community-acquired pneumonias necessitates the use of adjunctive treatments. Reassessment should be undertaken 72 hours after initiation of therapy in order to evaluate the response to treatment, to simplify or to readapt the empirical treatment. Unjustified continuation of wide spectrum antibiotics leads to adverse events and widespread of bacterial resistance.

The attached oligosaccharide chain is subjected to stepwise trimming by the actions of specific glucosidases and mannosidases. In these processes, the transiently expressed N-glycans, as processing intermediates, function as signals for the determination of glycoprotein fates, i.e., folding, transport, or degradation through interactions of a series of intracellular lectins. The monoglucosylated glycoforms are hallmarks of incompletely folded states of glycoproteins in this system, whereas the outer mannose trimming leads to ER-associated glycoprotein degradation. This review outlines the recently emerging evidence regarding the molecular and structural basis of this glycoprotein quality control system, which is regulated through dynamic interplay among intracellular lectins, glycosidases, and glycosyltransferase. Structural snapshots of carbohydrate-lectin interactions have been provided at the atomic level using X-ray crystallographic analyses. Conformational ensembles of uncomplexed triantennary high-mannose-type oligosaccharides have been characterized in a quantitative manner using molecular dynamics simulation in conjunction with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These complementary views provide new insights into glycoprotein recognition in quality control coupled with N-glycan processing.","publish_time":"2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Satoh, Tadashi; Yamaguchi, Takumi; Kato, Koichi","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/deda9e69d8455166370e8bd96c2bdb630c4b97b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6272264.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules20022475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25647580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glycoprotein recognition","glycoprotein quality control system","ER-associated glycoprotein degradation","determination of glycoprotein fates","N-glycan processing","series of intracellular lectins","structural basis","triantennary tetradecasaccharide","outer mannose","lectin interactions","processing intermediates","N-glycans","stepwise trimming","sugar chain","molecular dynamics simulation","Conformational ensembles of uncomplexed triantennary high-mannose","Structural snapshots of carbohydrate","attached oligosaccharide chain","conjunction","new insights","signals","leads","nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","hallmarks","folded states of glycoproteins","function","quantitative manner","glycosidases","type oligosaccharides","actions of specific glucosidases","atomic level","complementary views","emerging evidence","dynamic interplay","X-ray crystallographic analyses","synthesized proteins","monoglucosylated glycoforms","mannosidases","transport","glycosyltransferase","endoplasmic reticulum","review","GlcNAc","processes"],"language":"en"},

We searched six major Chinese and English databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case-control studies (CCSs) of Integrated Medicine on COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened, identified studies, and extracted data. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess the quality of included RCTs and CCSs, respectively. Stata (version 13.0; StataCorp) was used to perform meta-analyses using the random-effects model. Risk ratio (RR) was used for dichotomous data while the weighted mean difference (WMD) was adopted for continuous variables as effect size, respectively, both of which were demonstrated in effect size and 95% confidence intervals. A total of 11 studies were included. Four were RCTs and seven were CCSs. The samples of including studies ranged from 18 to 100 (total 982). The traditional Chinese medicine included Chinese medicine compound drugs (QingFei TouXie FuZhengFang) and Chinese patent medicine (such as Shufeng Jiedu Capsule, Lianhua Qingwen granules).

Peptide sequence analysis of the N protein of several North American isolates identified two potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences located at amino acids 10\u201313 and 41\u201342, which were labeled NLS-1 and NLS-2, respectively. Peptides containing NLS-1 or NLS-2 were sufficient to accumulate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the nucleus. The inactivation of NLS-1 by site-directed mutagenesis or the deletion of the first 14 amino acids did not affect N protein localization to the nucleolus. The substitution of key lysine residues with uncharged amino acids in NLS-2 blocked nuclear/nucleolar localization. Site-directed mutagenesis within NLS-2 identified the sequence, KKNKK, as forming the core localization domain within NLS-2. Using an in vitro pull-down assay, the N protein was able to bind importin-\u03B1, importin-\u03B2 nuclear transport proteins. The localization pattern of N-EGFP fusion peptides represented by a series of deletions from the C- and N-terminal ends of the N protein identified a region covering amino acids 41\u201372, which contained a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) sequence. The 41\u201372 N peptide when fused to EGFP mimicked the nucleolar\u2013cytoplasmic distribution of native N. These results identify a single NLS involved in the transport of N from the cytoplasm and into nucleus. An additional peptide sequence, overlapping NLS-2, is involved in the further targeting of N to the nucleolus.","publish_time":"2003-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rowland, Raymond R.R.; Schneider, Paula; Fang, Ying; Wootton, Sarah; Yoo, Dongwan; Benfield, David A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa2955f99f662162ffd0eac542ce96e8e74f5d64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125632.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203004823; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203004823","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N protein localization","transport of N","single NLS","inactivation of NLS","localization pattern of N","targeting of N","N-terminal ends","nucleolar localization signal","potential nuclear localization signal","uncharged amino acids","nucleolus","protein of porcine reproductive","core localization domain","Peptide sequence analysis","additional peptide sequence","enhanced green fluorescent protein","EGFP fusion peptides","site","mutagenesis","nucleus","importin-\u03B2 nuclear transport proteins","importin-\u03B1","viral nucleocapsid","North American isolates","PRRSV","respiratory syndrome virus","substitution of key lysine residues","sequences","cytoplasmic distribution of native","results","principal component","series of deletions","NoLS","region","pull-down assay","KKNKK"],"language":"en"},

It is characterized by episodes of infection that involve hundreds of millions of people each year. Since that in the seasons 2010\u20132011 and 2011\u20132012 the circulation of FLUB was decreasing we evaluated the clinical presentation, demographic characteristics, admitting department, and length of stay in children who contracted influenza admitted to Bambino Ges\u00F9 Children\u2019s Hospital, during the 2012\u20132013 influenza season, with the aim to establish if the recover of FLUB was associated to a clinical worsening, in comparison with those due to FLUA. METHODS: A total of 133 respiratory specimens, collected from patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infections, positive for the Influenza A and B viruses (FLUA and B) were subtyped. Comparisons between the FLUA and FLUB groups were performed with the one-way ANOVA for continuous parametric variables, the Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric variables, or the Chi-Square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test (if cells \u003C5) for categorical variables. RESULTS: 87.09 % of the FLUA isolates were the H1N1 subtype and 12.90 % were H3N2. Among the FLUB isolates, 91.54 % were the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage and 8.45 % were the B/Victoria/02/87 lineage. The largest number of FLUA/H1N1 cases was observed in children less than 1 years old, while the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage was most prevalent in children 3\u20136 years old. Fever was a common symptom for both FLUA and B affected patients. However, respiratory symptoms were more prevalent in patients affected by FLUA. The median length of stay in the hospital was 5 days for FLUA and 3 days for FLUB. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features correlated to different Influenza viruses, and relevant subtypes, were evaluated concluding that the increasing of FLUB in the season 2012\u20132013 was without any dramatic change in clinical manifestation. Our findings suggest, finally, that a stronger commitment to managing patients affected by FLUA is required, as the disease is more severe than FLUB.","publish_time":"2016-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mancinelli, Livia; Onori, Manuela; Concato, Carlo; Sorge, Roberto; Chiavelli, Stefano; Coltella, Luana; Raucci, Umberto; Reale, Antonio; Menichella, Donato; Russo, Cristina","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb2c5faf4ed6df2563f6f1830de5b7fbad0ead87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4705698.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1333-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26743673/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FLUB","FLUA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FLUA isolates","FLUB isolates","B viruses","patients","FLUB groups","increasing of FLUB","recover of FLUB","circulation of FLUB","largest number of FLUA","influenza season","lineage","different Influenza viruses","respiratory symptoms","clinical features","clinical presentation","clinical manifestation","clinical worsening","Chi-Square test","non-parametric variables","continuous parametric variables","categorical variables","respiratory specimens","years old","Yamagata","days","symptoms of respiratory tract infections","Mann-Whitney test","Fisher\u2019s exact test","H1N1 cases","H1N1 subtype","median length","Bambino Ges\u00F9 Children\u2019s Hospital","one-way ANOVA","cells","relevant subtypes","hundreds of millions","major public health issue","demographic characteristics","department","concluding","common symptom","people","total","dramatic change","BACKGROUND","aim","disease","Comparisons","episodes of infection","stronger commitment","Fever","H3N2","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","Victoria","RESULTS","seasons","findings"],"language":"en"},

There is an urgent need for novel strategies to combat bacterial infections caused by MDR strains like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Quorum sensing (QS) is a critical communication system in bacterial community controlling survival and virulence. The awareness of the importance of QS in bacterial infections has stimulated research to identify QS inhibitors (QSIs) to defeat microbes. In this study, four FDA-approved drugs (besides azithromycin as positive QSI) were tested for potential QS inhibition against clinical A. baumannii isolates and P. aeruginosa (PAO1) standard strain. The inhibitory effect of these drugs on virulence factors of both microbes has been investigated. The studied virulence factors include biofilm formation, twitching and swarming motilities, proteolytic enzyme production, and resistance to oxidative stress. The four tested drugs (erythromycin, levamisole, chloroquine, and propranolol) inhibited QS in Chromobacterium violaceum by 84, 72, 55.1, and 37.3%, respectively. They also significantly inhibited virulence factors in both PAO1 and A. baumannii at sub-inhibitory concentrations. These findings were confirmed by qRT-PCR and mice mortality test, where tested drugs highly repressed the expression of abaI gene and showed significantly improved mice survival rates. In addition, molecular docking studies against AbaI and AbaR proteins of QS system in A. baumannii revealed the potential inhibition of QS by tested drugs. Beside their known activities, the tested drugs could be given new life as QSIs to combat A. baumannii nosocomial infections (alone or in combination with antimicrobials).

Rapid immunoassays are fast but insensitive, whereas real-time RT-PCR is sensitive but susceptible to genetic mutations and often requires multiple serial assays. The FluChip-8G Influenza A\u002BB Assay provides type and subtype/lineage identification of influenza A and B, including non-seasonal A viruses, in a single microarray-based assay with same day turnaround time. Objective To evaluate key analytical performance characteristics of the FluChip-8G Influenza A\u002BB Assay. Study design Analytical sensitivity, cross-reactivity, and multi-site reproducibility were evaluated. Results The limit of detection (LOD) for the FluChip-8G influenza A\u002BB Assay ranged from 5.8 \u00D7 102\u20131.5 \u00D7 105 genome copies/mL, with most samples \u223C2 \u00D7 103 genome copies/mL (\u223C160 genome copies/reaction). Fifty two (52) additional strains were correctly identified near the LOD, demonstrating robust reactivity. Two variant viruses (H1N1v and H3N2v) resulted in dual identification as both \u201Cnon-seasonal influenza A\u201D and A/H1N1pdm09. No reproducible cross-reactivity was observed for the 34 organisms tested, however, challenges with internal control inhibition due to crude growth matrix were observed. Lastly, samples tested near the LOD showed high reproducibility (97.0% (95% CI 94.7\u201398.7)) regardless of operator, site, reagent lot, or testing day. Conclusion The FluChip-8G Influenza A\u002BB Assay is an effective new method for detecting and identifying both seasonal and non-seasonal influenza viruses, as revealed by good sensitivity and robust reactivity to 52 unique strains of influenza virus. In addition, the lack of cross-reactivity to non-influenza pathogens and high lab-to-lab reproducibility highlight the analytical performance of the assay as an alternative to real-time RT-PCR and sequencing-based assays. Clinical validation of the technology in a multi-site clinical study is the subject of a separate investigation.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, Amber W.; Dawson, Erica D.; Blair, Rebecca H.; Johnson, James E.; Slinskey, Amelia H.; Smolak, Andrew W.; Toth, Evan; Liikanen, Kyle; Stoughton, Robert S.; Smith, Catherine; Talbot, Sarah; Rowlen, Kathy L.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21309c53f0a15cfb0a81750e81d4bad141f9c01c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6779046.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093419302009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271790/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093419302009; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113686","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Influenza","LOD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G Influenza","B Assay","non-seasonal influenza viruses","non-influenza pathogens","lineage identification of influenza","Abstract Background Influenza","FluChip","unique strains of influenza virus","robust reactivity","reproducible cross-reactivity","LOD","genome copies","multi-site reproducibility","single microarray-based assay","multi-site clinical study","lab reproducibility","high reproducibility","real-time RT-PCR","high lab","Study design Analytical sensitivity","lack of cross","variant viruses","Clinical validation","samples","key analytical performance characteristics","sequencing-based assays","dual identification","good sensitivity","additional strains","infecting virus important","day turnaround time","multiple serial assays","characterization","significant annual disease burden","genetic mutations","subject","technology","internal control inhibition","subtype","public health settings","H3N2v","alternative","crude growth matrix","effective new method","challenges","H1N1v","reagent lot","Objective","Rapid immunoassays","operator","Conclusion","separate investigation","limit of detection","organisms","reaction","H1N1pdm09"],"language":"en"},

When vaccines were available to protect the population against the major epidemics, then chronic, recurrent, or persistent infections came into focus. Viruses are everywhere and all organisms are permanently exposed to them. The result of this contact depends on the particular moment a t which a given cell is exposed to the virus. Rubella, for example, provokes a very benign disease in adults, but can induce abnormalities in the differentiating fetus. Although interferon is active against virus aggression, excess interferon has a toxic effect and can block differentiation. The capacity of several viruses to act as cellular mutagens by modifying chromosomes is well established, whatever the molecular mechanism may be. Mutations at the cellular level were carefully analyzed for their tumorigenic potential.","publish_time":"1986-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huppert, J.; Wild, T.

Two out of fifteen dogs from households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong SAR were found to be infected using quantitative RT-PCR, serology, sequencing the viral genome, and in one dog, virus isolation. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in a 17-year-old neutered male Pomeranian from five nasal swabs collected over a 13-day period. A 2.5-year-old male German Shepherd dog had SARS CoV-2 RNA on two occasions and virus was isolated from nasal and oral swabs. Both dogs had antibody responses detected using plaque reduction neutralization assays. Viral genetic sequences of viruses from the two dogs were identical to the virus detected in the respective human cases. The animals remained asymptomatic during quarantine.

A controlled randomized blind design with 800 lactating dairy pregnant cows diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) between Days 35 and 57 of gestation from one dairy farm were included. The cows were randomly divided according to detection of allantochorion membrane (FMS group; n = 264), detection of amniotic sac (ASP group; n = 266), and TRUS (control [CON] group; n = 270). TRUS was considered as the criterion standard method of comparison. The entire PRP was performed by one experienced veterinarian. Then, all the cows were reexamined only by TRUS between 2 and 4 weeks later by two independent veterinarians to assess PRL. The calving rate one (number of cows calved divided by the number of cows initially pregnant) and calving rate two (number of cows calved divided by the number of cows pregnant at reexamination) for each group was calculated. All abortions and stillborns were necropsied, and calves alive were followed for 5 days. The overall initial PRL (between initial pregnant cows and reexamination) for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 7.4% (19/258), 8.8% (23/262), and 9.2% (24/260), respectively (P = 0.75). The overall late PRL (between reexamination and calving) for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 4.2% (9/213), 5.7% (12/209), and 4.2% (9/216), respectively (P = 0.71). The calving rate one for FMS, ASP, and TRUS groups was 79.1% (204/258), 75.2% (197/262), and 79.6% (207/260), respectively (P = 0.63). The calving rate two for the same groups was 85.4% (204/239), 82.4% (197/239), and 87.7% (207/236), respectively (P = 0.27). The number of fetuses aborted late, premature, and mature dead from FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 6, 4, and 5, respectively (P = 0.85), and no abnormalities at necropsy were detected. One stillborn male calf with atresia coli after 281 days of gestation from a cow examined by ASP at Day 51 was diagnosed. It was concluded that the use of either FMS or ASP for pregnancy diagnosis during late embryonic or early fetal period did not increase the PRL, affect calving rates, or produce calves with congenital abnormalities.","publish_time":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romano, Juan E.; Pinedo, Pablo; Bryan, Kelsey; Ramos, Roney S.; Solano, Karol G.; Merchan, Daniel; Velez, Juan","journal":"Theriogenology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a13ec041578a2cca14b9970f5da50984d50cb24b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125832.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X16305441; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0093691X16305441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28166972/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.11.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRP","TRUS","PRL","ASP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ASP group","number of cows pregnant","FMS group","TRUS groups","initial pregnant cows","calving rates","reexamination","lactating dairy pregnant cows","overall late PRL","overall initial PRL","number of fetuses","pregnancy diagnosis","days of gestation","detection of allantochorion membrane","detection of amniotic sac","fetal period","pregnancy loss","newborn calves","calves alive","congenital abnormalities","dairy farm","entire PRP","transrectal ultrasonography","atresia coli","controlled randomized blind design","rectum palpation","stillborn male calf","mature dead","criterion standard method of comparison","present investigation","stillborns","weeks","independent veterinarians","experienced veterinarian","objectives","abortions","necropsy"],"language":"en"},

Previous research has shown that zirconia nanoparticles can be used as anticancer materials, but their antiviral activity has not been reported. Here, we investigated the antiviral effect of zirconia (ZrO(2)) nanoparticles (NPs) against a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the antiviral effects of ZrO(2) on H5N1 virus were assessed in vivo, and the molecular mechanism responsible for this protection was investigated. RESULTS: Mice treated with 200 nm positively-charged NPs at a dose of 100 mg/kg showed higher survival rates and smaller reductions in weight. 200 nm ZrO(2) activated mature dendritic cells and initially promoted the expression of cytokines associated with the antiviral response and innate immunity. In the lungs of H5N1-infected mice, ZrO(2) treatment led to less pathological lung injury, significant reduction in influenza A virus replication, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: This antiviral study using zirconia NPs shows protection of mice against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and suggests strong application potential for this method, introducing a new tool against a wide range of microbial infections.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huo, Caiyun; Xiao, Jin; Xiao, Kai; Zou, Shumei; Wang, Ming; Qi, Peng; Liu, Tianlong; Hu, Yanxin","journal":"Int J Nanomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11888535f2eb67c15d08783b164def90aa47a3bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6996547.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s221667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32099358/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral study","antiviral effects of ZrO","pathogenic avian influenza virus","H5N1 virus","antiviral effect of zirconia","antiviral response","zirconia NPs","antiviral activity","nm ZrO","virus replication","protection of mice","zirconia nanoparticles","infected mice","influenza viral infection","new tool","anticancer materials","expression of cytokines","New approaches","lungs of H5N1","overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines","significant reduction","strong application potential","pathological lung injury","smaller reductions","treatment","higher survival rates","wide range of microbial infections","weight","mature dendritic cells","molecular mechanism responsible","innate immunity","Previous research","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","dose"],"language":"en"},

The practicality and clinical suitability of four face shields printed using a fused deposition modeling printer were examined. The weight, printing time, and required tools for assembly were evaluated. To assess the clinical suitability, each face shield was worn for one hour by 10 clinicians and rated using a visual analogue scale. The filament weight (21-42 g) and printing time (1:40-3:17 h) differed significantly between the four frames. Likewise, the fit, wearing comfort, space for additional PPE, and protection varied between the designs. For clinical suitability, a chosen design should allow sufficient space for goggles and N95 respirators as well as maximum coverage of the facial area. Consequently, two datasets are recommended.

This article provides practical guidance to front-line physicians forced to make critical rationing decisions. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Medline search for scientific literature, reviews, and guidance documents related to epidemic ICU triage including from professional bodies. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical studies, reviews, and guidelines were selected and reviewed by all authors and discussed by internet conference and email. DATA EXTRACTION: References and data were based on relevance and author consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: We review key challenges of resource-driven triage and data from affected ICUs. We recommend that once available resources are maximally extended, triage is justified utilizing a strategy that provides the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. A triage algorithm based on clinical estimations of the incremental survival benefit (saving the most life-years) provided by ICU care is proposed. \u201CFirst come, first served\u201D is used to choose between individuals with equal priorities and benefits. The algorithm provides practical guidance, is easy to follow, rapidly implementable and flexible. It has four prioritization categories: performance score, ASA score, number of organ failures, and predicted survival. Individual units can readily adapt the algorithm to meet local requirements for the evolving pandemic. Although the algorithm improves consistency and provides practical and psychologic support to those performing triage, the final decision remains a clinical one. Depending on country and operational circumstances, triage decisions may be made by a triage team or individual doctors. However, an experienced critical care specialist physician should be ultimately responsible for the triage decision. Cautious discharge criteria are proposed acknowledging the difficulties to facilitate the admission of queuing patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individual institutions may use this guidance to develop prospective protocols that assist the implementation of triage decisions to ensure fairness, enhance consistency, and decrease provider moral distress.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sprung, Charles L.; Joynt, Gavin M.; Christian, Michael D.; Truog, Robert D.; Rello, Jordi; Nates, Joseph L.","journal":"Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4847951107ded9c733bd5509a344e4b5a1848b23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217126.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392017/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["triage algorithm","driven triage","triage team","implementation of triage decisions","epidemic ICU triage","practical guidance","DATA SOURCES","DATA SYNTHESIS","DATA EXTRACTION","guidance documents","greatest number of patients","reviews","clinical estimations","Clinical studies","consistency","ICU care","critical rationing decisions","Individual institutions","individual doctors","Individual units","admission of queuing patients","ASA score","performance score","predicted survival","final decision","experienced critical care specialist physician","number of organ failures","incremental survival benefit","Medline search","scientific literature","front-line physicians","PubMed","key challenges of resource","prioritization categories","difficulties","local requirements","relevance","STUDY SELECTION","article","professional bodies","country","operational circumstances","References","affected ICUs","psychologic support","fairness","life-years","prospective protocols","internet conference","individuals","equal priorities","benefits","evolving pandemic","provider moral distress","OBJECTIVES","Coronavirus disease","guidelines","strategy","Cautious discharge criteria","world\u2019s healthcare systems","author consensus","authors","email","CONCLUSIONS","available resources"],"language":"en"},

To date, no effective drugs that improve the clinical outcome of influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients have been identified. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are involved in several pathologies such as cardiovascular functions, renal disease, and acute lung injury. In the current study, we report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model. Moreover, ACE2 deficiency worsened the disease pathogenesis markedly, mainly by targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1).

To achieve this goal minimum reduction of viruses by treatment trains have been suggested. For use of edible crops a 6-log reduction and for production of potable drinking water a 12-log reduction has been suggested. These reductions were based on assuming infective virus concentrations of 105 to 106 per liter. Recent application of molecular methods suggests that some pathogenic viruses may be occurring in concentrations of 107 to 109 per liter. Factors influencing these levels include the development of molecular methods for virus detection, emergence of newly recognized viruses, decrease in per capita water use due to conservation measures, and outbreaks. Since neither cell culture nor molecular methods can assess all the potentially infectious virus in wastewater conservative estimates should be used to assess the virus load in untreated wastewater. This review indicates that an additional 2- to 3-log reduction of viruses above current recommendations may be needed to ensure the safety of recycled water.

This review aims to systematically combine and evaluate the available literature of the prevalence of respiratory viruses in patients with AECOPD, detected by PCR. Methods An electronic search strategy was performed on PubMed and Embase and reference lists were screened for eligible studies. Cross-sectional, prospective studies and case-control studies were included. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of respiratory viruses (adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, EBV, hMPV, influenza, parainfluenza, rhino-/enterovirus, RSV) in respiratory secretions of patients during an AECOPD. Secondary outcomes were the odds of the presence of the viruses in different respiratory secretions and the odds of the presence of viruses in upper and lower respiratory tract (URT/LRT) samples. Results Nineteen studies with 1728 patients were included. Rhino-/enteroviruses (16.39%), RSV (9.90%) and influenza (7.83%) were the most prevalent viruses detected with lower detection rates of coronaviruses (4.08%) and parainfluenza (3.35%). Adenovirus (2.07%), hMPV (2.78%) and bocaviruses (0.56%) appear to be rare causative agents of AECOPD. Definitive conclusions regarding the role of EBV cannot be made. Seven of the eight analyzed viruses had a higher prevalence in LRT samples. Coronaviruses were detected more frequently in the URT. Conclusions Respiratory viruses are frequently detected in both URT and LRT samples in AECOPD with rhino-/enteroviruses, RSV and influenza viruses the most prevalent viruses. Detection rates vary between the two sites for different viruses.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zwaans, W.A.R.; Mallia, P.; van Winden, M.E.C.; Rohde, G.G.U.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fda3a341c26f401e071e365f7649e53501f4e825.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106508.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214002583; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.06.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25066886/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214002583","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","PCR","EBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","prevalence of respiratory viruses","presence of viruses","role of viruses","prevalent viruses","different viruses","Conclusions Respiratory viruses","respiratory secretions of patients","different respiratory secretions","lower respiratory tract","RSV","LRT samples","rhino","URT","prospective studies","eligible studies","higher prevalence","odds","role of EBV","hMPV","case-control studies","lower detection rates of coronaviruses","rare causative agents of AECOPD","adenovirus","enteroviruses","parainfluenza","exacerbations of COPD","Definitive conclusions","PubMed","reference lists","increasing knowledge","electronic search strategy","Embase","primary outcome measure","sites","available literature","Methods","Abstract Background","Secondary outcomes","Results","PCR","extent","bocaviruses","review"],"language":"en"},

This chapter addresses the broad health concerns of those two groups, followed by discussion on parasites, infectious diseases, and vaccination, and concludes with suggestions for chemical restraint and anaesthesia of red pandas. Several drugs and drug combinations have been used to chemically restrain red pandas for short procedures or for the induction of general anaesthesia. Neonates are usually \u201Cmasked down,\u201D by placing a face mask over their face, and having them breathe 5% isoflurane in oxygen. Alternatively, an induction chamber can be used in all age groups. Anaesthesia is induced by flowing 5% isoflurane in oxygen into the box. A combination of ketamine HCl, a dissociative anaesthetic and medetomidine, an alpha-2-adrenergicagonist works well in red pandas for short, non-noxious procedures, such as blood collection, teeth cleaning, orradiology. Typically, the animal is transferred from a crate to a small squeeze cage and the drugs are given intramuscularly, via hand injection. The effects of the medetomidine can be reversed with atipamezole and recoveries are usually rapid and smooth. Other drug combinations that have been used in juvenile and adult red pandas are: ketamine and xylazine; ketamine with xylazine i.m. and followed by i.v. diazepam; and tiletamine/zolazepam.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Philippa, Joost; Ramsay, Ed","journal":"Red Panda","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0c6877108c1a134a6f84a01eeee97c1e918a200.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151766.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978143777813700015X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978143777813700015X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anaesthesia of red pandas","adult red pandas","age groups","red panda health problems","short procedures","xylazine","age-based groups","medetomidine","drugs","induction of general anaesthesia","drug combinations","isoflurane","oxygen","combination of ketamine HCl","induction chamber","face mask","non-noxious procedures","broad health concerns","captive animals","blood collection","dissociative anaesthetic","parasites","chemical restraint","crate","infectious diseases","vaccination","teeth cleaning","orradiology","small squeeze cage","alpha","discussion","suggestions","juvenile","recoveries","Publisher Summary","atipamezole","diazepam","chapter","adrenergicagonist","tiletamine","zolazepam","box","hand injection","effects","Neonates"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: This study attempts to describe ADEM incidence in large Chinese populations located in four geographically different and moderately distant areas of the same province. METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted with ADEM patients in Nanjing, Nantong, Yancheng and Xuzhou. The survey was carried out in regions that might have received patients meeting the case definition of ADEM provided by the International Pediatric MS Study Group from 2008 to 2011. A total of 125 hospitals were included and 412 patients were identified through the hospital information systems (HIS). RESULTS: The incidence of ADEM was 0.32/100,000/year. There are two peaks on the age-specific ADEM rates curve. One is 0.77/100,000/year among 0- to 9-year-olds, the other is 0.45/100,000/year in those aged 50\u201359 years. The incidence rate found for ADEM in males was 0.34/100,000/year, and in females was 0.29/100,000/year. The highest incidence rate was in Nanjing (0.40/100,000/year). CONCLUSIONS: The average annual incidence of ADEM was 0.32/100,000/year. The peak age of onset was 50\u201359 years old and 0\u20139 years old. The incidence among males was insignificantly higher than that among females.

We have tested the ability of magnetic Nanotrap\u00AE (NT) particles to improve stability and detection of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), viral capsid protein, and viral genomic RNA in whole human blood at elevated temperature and prolonged storage conditions. NT particles have previously been shown to capture and enrich multiple pathogens including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, coronavirus, and Rift Valley fever virus. Our study indicates that samples incubated with NT particles had detectable levels of infectious VEEV in blood equal to or greater than samples without NT treatment across all temperatures. Viral RNA detection was increased in the presence of NT particles at later time points (72 h) and higher temperature (40\u00B0C) conditions. Likewise, detection of VEEV capsid protein was enhanced in the presence of NT particles up to 72 h at 40\u00B0C. Finally, we intranasally infected C3H mice with TC-83, the live attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV, and demonstrated that NT particles could substantially increase the detection of VEEV capsid in infected blood incubated up to 72 h at 40\u00B0C. Samples without NT particles had undetectable capsid protein levels. Taken together, our data demonstrate the ability of NT particles to preserve and enable detection of VEEV in human and mouse blood samples over time and at elevated temperatures.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akhrymuk, Ivan; Lin, Shih-Chao; Sun, Mei; Patnaik, Anurag; Lehman, Caitlin; Altamura, Louis; Minogue, Timothy; Lepene, Ben; van Hoek, Monique L.; Kehn-Hall, Kylene","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eddf68bf069ab23f6fbe7c7ab16c1c49335f4de9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6999085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32064269/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00509","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley","VEEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of NT particles","ability of NT particles","NT treatment","detection of VEEV capsid protein","viral capsid protein","Viral RNA detection","mouse blood samples","human blood","infected blood","blood equal","patient\u0027s blood","viral genomic RNA","identification of viral antigens","influenza virus","detectable levels of infectious VEEV","undetectable capsid protein levels","detection of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus","controlled temperature conditions","respiratory syncytial virus","live attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV","higher temperature","elevated temperatures","Rift Valley fever virus","prolonged storage conditions","later time points","infected C3H mice","ability of magnetic Nanotrap","coronavirus","stability","TC","nucleic acids","multiple pathogens","induced disease","loss of sample integrity","field","remote locations","diagnostic labs","Shipments","modern techniques","data","Diagnosis","testing","study"],"language":"en"},

Digital imaging permits rapid electronic transfer of data to radiologists, and recent improvements in digital camera technology present high quality, yet cheaper, options. Methods We evaluated the comparative utility of digital camera versus film digitizer in capturing chest radiographs in a pneumonia surveillance system in rural Thailand using a panel of radiologists; the gold standard was the hard-copy radiograph. We calculated sensitivity and specificity and conducted a receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. Results Of the 192 radiographs from patients with clinical pneumonia, 166 (86%) were classified as pneumonia on the hard copies. Sensitivity and specificity for identifying pneumonia were 89% and 73% for the camera and 90% and 65% for the digitizer. In the ROC analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in the area under the curve (camera, 0.86; film digitizer, 0.91, p =0.29). The digital camera set cost $965 compared to $3000 for the film digitizer. Conclusion Detection of pneumonia was not measurably compromised by using digital cameras compared with film digitizers. The 3-fold lower cost of the digital camera makes this technology an affordable and widely accessible alternative for surveillance systems, vaccine trials, and perhaps clinical use.","publish_time":"2006-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Javadi, Massoud; Subhannachart, Ponglada; Levine, Sunisa; Vijitsanguan, Chomphunut; Tungsagunwattana, Sutarat; Dowell, Scott F.; Olsen, Sonja J.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89620ddb24f8095fc9af260728a871f995d40d26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110458.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971205001207; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971205001207","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Digital"],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["clinical pneumonia","Digital imaging","comparative utility of digital camera","digital cameras","pneumonia surveillance system","digital camera technology present high quality","Conclusion Detection of pneumonia","film digitizers","surveillance systems","specificity","ROC analysis","sensitivity","standardized classification of chest radiographs","panel of radiologists","Summary Background Accurate surveillance","clinical use","lower cost","hard copies","recent improvements","vaccine trials","accessible alternative","rapid electronic transfer of data","rural Thailand","receiver operator characteristics","gold standard","area","curve","patients","options","significant difference","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of the Rivalta test for FIP and to identify correlations between a positive Rivalta test and variables measured in effusion fluid and peripheral blood. METHODS: In this retrospective study, medical records of cats with effusions were reviewed, and cats with conclusive results for the Rivalta test were included. The prevalence of FIP in this population was determined, and sensitivity, specificity, and PPV and NPV of the Rivalta test were calculated. Variables measured in effusion fluid and peripheral blood were compared between cats that had positive or negative Rivalta tests using the Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010test and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of 851 cats with effusions, 782 had conclusively positive or negative results for the Rivalta test. A definitive final diagnosis was made in 497 of these cats. Prevalence of FIP in cats with effusion and a conclusive Rivalta test result was 34.6%. The Rivalta test had a sensitivity of 91.3%, specificity of 65.5%, PPV of 58.4%, and NPV of 93.4% for the diagnosis of FIP. These values increased when cats with lymphoma or bacterial infections were excluded, or when only cats \u2264 2 years were considered. Increased effusion cholesterol concentration and specific gravity as well as decreased serum albumin:globulin ratio and hyperbilirubinemia were positively correlated with positive Rivalta test results. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of the Rivalta test for the diagnosis of FIP were lower than previously reported except when used in young cats. The components in effusions that lead to a positive Rivalta test remain unknown, but the positivity is not simply related to high total protein concentration.","publish_time":"2012-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fischer, Yvonne; Sauter\u2010Louis, Carola; Hartmann, Katrin","journal":"Vet Clin Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18dea69bc16c7b012216bff398db2c93b9e7c02f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169324.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22913882/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-165x.2012.00464.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["positive Rivalta test results","conclusive Rivalta test result","young cats","negative Rivalta tests","diagnosis of FIP","PPV","medical records of cats","effusions","specificity","prevalence of FIP","sensitivity","negative results","effusion fluid","NPV","conclusive results","Increased effusion cholesterol concentration","variables","peripheral blood","OBJECTIVES","definitive final diagnosis","retrospective study","predictive values","high total protein concentration","specific gravity","decreased serum albumin","Whitney U","hyperbilirubinemia","Mann","globulin ratio","feline infectious peritonitis","correlations","Europe","multivariate analysis","lymphoma","diagnostic accuracy","bacterial infections","positivity","population","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","components","years"],"language":"en"},

This not only ensures that viral proteins will be produced, but also stifles innate host defences that are aimed at inhibiting the capacity of infected cells for protein synthesis. Remarkably, nearly every step of the translation process can be targeted by virally encoded functions.

While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.

Strong association between the HLA region and autoimmune disease (AID) has been established for over fifty years. Association of components of the HLA class II encoded HLA-DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 haplotype has been detected with several AIDs, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and Graves\u2019 disease. Molecules encoded by this region play a key role in exogenous antigen presentation to CD4\u002B Th cells, indicating the importance of this pathway in AID initiation and progression. Although other components of the HLA class I and III regions have also been investigated for association with AID, apart from the association of HLA-B*27 with ankylosing spondylitis, it has been difficult to determine additional susceptibility loci independent of the strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the HLA class II genes. Recent advances in the statistical analysis of LD and the recruitment of large AID datasets have allowed investigation of the HLA class I and III regions to be re-visited. Association of the HLA class I region, independent of known HLA class II effects, has now been detected for several AIDs, including strong association of HLA-B with type 1 diabetes and HLA-C with multiple sclerosis and Graves\u2019 disease. These results provide further evidence of a possible role for bacterial or viral infection and CD8\u002B T cells in AID onset.

In such an event, adequate supplies of affordable vaccines and antiviral agents will be unavailable to most people in the world. In view of the overwhelming need for effective alternatives, generic agents that target the host immune response or the pandemic virus should be considered. Many scientists doubt the effectiveness of these agents. Nonetheless, several studies suggest that statins improve outcomes in patients with bacteraemia and pneumonia and might be similarly effective against influenza. An experimental study has shown that the fibrate gemfibrozil, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03B1 agonist, reduces mortality in H2N2 influenza virus-infected mice. There is substantial molecular cross-talk between statins and PPAR agonists, and their clinical effects are additive in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Chloroquine increases endosomal pH, impairing influenza virus release into the cytosol. Statins, fibrates, and chloroquine are produced as generic medications in developing countries. They are inexpensive, could be stockpiled, and would be available on the first pandemic day. With a lack of realistic alternatives for confronting the next pandemic, research is urgently needed to determine whether these and other generic agents could mitigate the effects of what might otherwise become an unprecedented global public-health crisis.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fedson, David S","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6d147027c445a49427507168a019c8b4def0b27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128266.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309908700707; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309908700707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18420459/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(08)70070-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPAR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["generic agents","pandemic virus","statins","antiviral agents","pandemic day","impairing influenza virus release","H2N2 influenza virus-infected mice","patients","generic medications","Summary Avian influenza","Chloroquine","effective alternatives","imminent pandemic threat","PPAR agonists","clinical effects","lack of realistic alternatives","mortality","\u03B1 agonist","peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","adequate supplies of affordable vaccines","endosomal pH","host immune response","overwhelming need","fibrate gemfibrozil","H5N1","outcomes","unprecedented global public-health crisis","event","pneumonia","bacteraemia","cytosol","cardiovascular diseases","substantial molecular cross","view","developing countries","people","experimental study","world","studies","scientists","effectiveness","fibrates","research"],"language":"en"},

As the building blocks for FET-based biosensors, one-dimensional NWs offer excellent surface-to-volume ratio and are more suitable and sensitive for sensing applications.

Although TiLV segment-1 shares homology with the influenza C virus PB1 and has four conserved motifs similar to influenza A, B, and C polymerases, it is unknown whether there are other properties shared between TiLV and orthomyxovirus. In the present study, we wanted to determine whether TiLV agglutinated avian and piscine erythrocytes, and whether its replication was inhibited by lysosomotropic agents, such as ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl), as seen for orthomyxoviruses. Our findings showed that influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8 (PR8) was able to hemagglutinate turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) red blood cells (RBCs), while infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) only agglutinated Atlantic salmon, but not turkey or tilapia, RBCs. In contrast to PR8 and ISAV, TiLV did not agglutinate turkey, Atlantic salmon, or tilapia RBCs. qRT-PCR analysis showed that 30 mM NH(4)Cl, a basic lysosomotropic agent, neither inhibited nor enhanced TiLV replication in E-11 cells. There was no difference in viral quantities in the infected cells with or without NH(4)Cl treatment during virus adsorption or at 1, 2, and 3 h post-infection. Given that hemagglutinin proteins that bind RBCs also serve as ligands that bind host cells during virus entry leading to endocytosis in orthomyxoviruses, the data presented here suggest that TiLV may use mechanisms that are different from orthomyxoviruses for entry and replication in host cells. Therefore, future studies should seek to elucidate the mechanisms used by TiLV for entry into host cells and to determine its mode of replication in infected cells.","publish_time":"2019-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chengula, Augustino Alfred; Mutoloki, Stephen; Evensen, \u00D8ystein; Munang\u2019andu, Hetron Mweemba","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3727f751c9cf944c8e6ddf578f5644629ed50d45.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6950307.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31842425/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11121152","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Atlantic"],"keyphrases":["virus entry","host cells","infected cells","TiLV segment","enhanced TiLV replication","icosahedral virus","virus adsorption","Tilapia lake virus","tilapia RBCs","influenza virus strain","influenza C virus PB1","infectious salmon anemia virus","turkey","red blood cells","agglutinated Atlantic salmon","orthomyxoviruses","Nile tilapia","mode of replication","ISAV","PR8","mechanisms","C polymerases","lysosomotropic agents","basic lysosomotropic agent","Oreochromis niloticus","shares homology","negative-sense single-stranded RNA","conserved motifs similar","Meleagris gallopavo","ssRNA","Salmo salar","Puerto Rico","endocytosis","ammonium chloride","viral quantities","piscine erythrocytes","ligands","difference","member","properties","treatment","findings","data","contrast","qRT-PCR analysis","h post-infection","family Amnoonviridae","hemagglutinin proteins","future studies","present study"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: We immobilized Ulp1 on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated Sepharose with a coupling efficiency of 1.7 mg/ml. The immobilized Ulp1 maintains 95% substrate-cleavage ability and significantly enhances pH and thermal stability, especially can withstand pH of 10.5. Besides resistance against some small molecules, the immobilized Ulp1 can tolerate 15% (v/v) DMSO and 20% (v/v) ethanol. It can be reused for more than 15 batch reactions with 90% activity retention. This provides a fast purification system to quickly obtain cleaved recombinant proteins with 95% purity from cell lysates with the application of immobilized Ulp1. CONCLUSIONS: Ulp1 used in immobilization form is a potentially useful tool for cleavage of SUMO-tagged proteins and may reduce time and cost of protein purification.

One of these classes, enterotoxigenic E coli, is the most common cause of diarrhea in beef and dairy calves in the first 4 days of life. Two other diarrheagenic classes, enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC), are important causes of disease in human beings, but less well substantiated causes of diarrhea in calves. E coli strains that cause hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans, express high levels of Shiga toxin, cause attaching-effacing (A/E) lesions in intestinal epithelial cells, and possess a specific 60-MDa EHEC plasmid are known as EHEC. One feature EHEC and EPEC have in common is the causation of intestinal epithelial lesions known as attaching and effacing (A/E). Attaching-effacing E coli (AEEC) is a designation for those E coli strains known to cause A/E lesions or at least carry the genes for this trait, and therefore include organisms that fall into either the EHEC or EPEC classes. Because cattle are carriers of many different serotypes of EHEC, much emphasis has been placed on the public health and food safety concerns associated with the fecal shedding of these organisms. However, much less emphasis has been given to their roles as diarrheagenic pathogens of cattle. The goal of this article is to address the question of pathogenicity, with a review that focuses on the results of studies of natural and experimental infections with these organisms. The authors conclude that there is overwhelming evidence that many different serogroups of AEEC are diarrheagenic pathogens of calves.","publish_time":"2010-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moxley, Rodney A.; Smith, David R.","journal":"Vet Clin North Am Food Anim Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31165346222e30211f9895693dee83cd824e2232.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5b5c2bba5c0aa28eba7986ca0eef8d1f0743585c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127223.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvfa.2009.10.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749072009001091; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749072009001091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20117541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EHEC","EPEC","AEEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effacing E coli","E coli strains","E lesions","enteropathogenic E coli","enterohemorrhagic E coli","enterotoxigenic E coli","Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli","diarrheagenic classes","feature EHEC","EPEC classes","cause attaching-effacing","different serotypes of EHEC","diarrheagenic pathogens of calves","organisms","MDa EHEC plasmid","common cause of diarrhea","diarrheagenic pathogens of cattle","causation of intestinal epithelial lesions","dairy calves","emphasis","different serogroups of AEEC","intestinal epithelial cells","substantiated causes of diarrhea","important causes of disease","humans","express high levels of Shiga toxin","hemolytic uremic syndrome","hemorrhagic colitis","food safety concerns","human beings","beef","designation","public health","experimental infections","overwhelming evidence","fecal shedding","results of studies","carriers","roles","review","genes","question of pathogenicity","article","authors","days of life","trait","virulence mechanisms","goal"],"language":"en"},

The antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection has been recognised in experimentally infected cats, and cellular immunity is considered to play an important role in preventing the onset of FIP. To evaluate the importance of cellular immunity for FIPV infection, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against feline interferon (fIFN)-\u03B3 were first created to establish fIFN-\u03B3 detection systems using the MAbs. Six anti-fIFN-\u03B3 MAbs were created. Then, the difference in epitope which those MAbs recognise was demonstrated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IFN-\u03B3 neutralisation tests. Detection systems for fIFN-\u03B3 (sandwich ELISA, ELISpot assay, and two-colour flow cytometry) were established using anti-fIFN-\u03B3 MAbs that recognise different epitopes. In all tests, fIFN-\u03B3 production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from cats experimentally infected with an FIPV isolate that did not develop the disease was significantly increased by heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation in comparison with medium alone. Especially, CD8\u002BfIFN-\u03B3 \u002B cells, but not CD4\u002BfIFN-\u03B3 \u002B cells, were increased. In contrast, fIFN-\u03B3 production from PBMCs isolated from cats that had developed FIP and specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats was not increased by heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation. These results suggest that cellular immunity plays an important role in preventing the development of FIP. Measurement of fIFN-\u03B3 production with the anti-fIFN-\u03B3 MAbs created in this study appeared to be useful in evaluating cellular immunity in cats.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Satoh, Ryoichi; Kaku, Ayumi; Satomura, Megumi; Kohori, Michiyo; Noura, Kanako; Furukawa, Tomoko; Kotake, Masako; Takano, Tomomi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15f8e9d78f2649ff640677a38cbe17617dee3e91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129491.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2011.01.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X1100026X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X1100026X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21334239/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fIFN-\u03B3 production","anti-fIFN-\u03B3 MAbs","fIFN-\u03B3 detection systems","Measurement of fIFN","FIPV infection","IFN-\u03B3 neutralisation tests","infected cats","heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation","importance of cellular immunity","development of FIP","onset of FIP","feline interferon","Feline infectious peritonitis virus","PBMCs","important role","ELISpot assay","sandwich ELISA","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","lethal disease","competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","monoclonal antibodies","two-colour flow cytometry","ADE","specific pathogen-free","comparison","CD4","antibody-dependent enhancement","SPF","different epitopes","study","CD8","contrast","difference","results"],"language":"en"},

Those that fare poorly with COVID-19 infection more commonly have cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension and diabetes. There are also several other conditions that raise concern for the welfare of patients with and at high risk for CVD during this pandemic. Traditional ambulatory care is disrupted and many patients are delaying or deferring necessary care, including preventive care. New impediments to medication access and adherence have arisen. Social distancing measures can increase social isolation and alter physical activity and nutrition patterns. Virtually all facility based cardiac rehabilitation programs have temporarily closed. If not promptly addressed, these changes may result in delayed waves of vulnerable patients presenting for urgent and preventable CVD events. Here, we provide several recommendations to mitigate the adverse effects of these disruptions in outpatient care. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be continued in patients already taking these medications. Where possible, it is strongly preferred to continue visits via telehealth, and patients should be counselled about promptly reporting new symptoms. Barriers to medication access should be reviewed with patients at every contact, with implementation of strategies to ensure ongoing provision of medications. Team-based care should be leveraged to enhance the continuity of care and adherence to lifestyle recommendations. Patient encounters should include discussion of safe physical activity options and access to healthy food choices.

Here, we characterized a recombinant form of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) nsp8 and found that the protein has metal ion-dependent RNA 3\u2032-terminal adenylyltransferase (TATase) activity, while other nucleotides were not (or very inefficiently) transferred to the 3\u2032 ends of single-stranded and (fully) double-stranded acceptor RNAs. Using partially double-stranded RNAs, very efficient TATase activity was observed if the opposite (template) strand contained a short 5\u2032 oligo(U) sequence, while very little (if any) activity was detected for substrates with other homopolymeric or heteropolymeric sequences in the 5\u2032 overhang. The oligo(U)-assisted/templated TATase activity on partial-duplex RNAs was confirmed for two other coronavirus nsp8 proteins, suggesting that the activity is conserved among coronaviruses. Replacement of a conserved Lys residue with Ala abolished the in vitro RNA-binding and TATase activities of nsp8 and caused a nonviable phenotype when the corresponding mutation was introduced into the HCoV-229E genome, confirming that these activities are mediated by nsp8 and critical for viral replication. In additional experiments, we obtained evidence that nsp8 has a pronounced specificity for adenylate and is unable to incorporate guanylate into RNA products, which strongly argues against the previously proposed template-dependent RNA polymerase activity of this protein. Given the presence of an oligo(U) stretch at the 5\u2032 end of coronavirus minus-strand RNAs, it is tempting to speculate (but remains to be confirmed) that the nsp8-mediated TATase activity is involved in the 3\u2032 polyadenylation of viral plus-strand RNAs. IMPORTANCE Previously, coronavirus nsp8 proteins were suggested to have template-dependent RNA polymerase activities resembling those of RNA primases or even canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, while more recent studies have suggested an essential cofactor function of nsp8 (plus nsp7) for nsp12-mediated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. In an effort to reconcile conflicting data from earlier studies, the study revisits coronavirus nsp8-associated activities using additional controls and proteins. The data obtained for three coronavirus nsp8 proteins provide evidence that the proteins share metal ion-dependent RNA 3\u2032 polyadenylation activities that are greatly stimulated by a short oligo(U) stretch in the template strand. In contrast, nsp8 was found to be unable to select and incorporate appropriate (matching) nucleotides to produce cRNA products from heteropolymeric and other homooligomeric templates. While confirming the critical role of nsp8 in coronavirus replication, the study amends the list of activities mediated by coronavirus nsp8 proteins in the absence of other proteins.","publish_time":"2019-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tvarogov\u00E1, Jana; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Bylapudi, Ganesh; Ferguson, Lyndsey J.; Karl, Nadja; Ziebuhr, John","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b26d29d455b4fc8be7c49dc1d73a18f66e1ca6fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6613758.xml.json","url":"https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/12/e00291-19.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00291-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918070/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus nsp8 proteins","TATase activities of nsp8","nsp8-mediated TATase activity","template-dependent RNA polymerase activities","nsp12-mediated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity","canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","RNA primases","RNA-binding","proposed template-dependent RNA polymerase activity","study revisits coronavirus nsp8-associated activities","critical role of nsp8","metal ion-dependent RNA","coronavirus replication","noncanonical template-dependent polymerase activities","polyadenylation activities","human coronavirus","end of coronavirus","templated TATase activity","efficient TATase activity","list of activities","diverse activities","template strand","Coronavirus nonstructural protein","essential cofactor function of nsp8","double-stranded RNAs","polyadenylation of viral plus-strand RNAs","short oligo","double-stranded acceptor RNAs","partial-duplex RNAs","evidence","HCoV","viral replication","nucleotides","E genome","earlier studies","recent studies","cRNA products","heteropolymeric sequences","additional controls","conflicting data","additional experiments","conserved Lys residue","nsp7","Ala","terminal adenylyltransferase","nonviable phenotype","corresponding mutation","matching","substrates","pronounced specificity","opposite","absence","homooligomeric templates","recombinant form","Replacement","homopolymeric","effort","guanylate","IMPORTANCE","overhang","presence","coronaviruses","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Lyle\u2019s flying fox (Pteropus lylei)\u2018s roosts and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals. Knowledge about age-specific pattern of CoV infection in P. lylei, prevalence, and viral shedding at roosts and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control CoV outbreak. METHODS: P. lylei bats were captured monthly during January\u2013December 2012 for detection of CoV at three areas in Chonburi province; two human dwellings, S1 and S2, where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm, 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost, S3. Nested RT-PCR of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured at S1 (11/44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length \u2264 136 mm) were found with more CoV infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group D betacoronavirus (n = 64) and alphacoronavirus (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: The fact that CoV infection and shedding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may suggest transmission from mother during peripartum period. Whether viral reactivation during parturition period or stress is responsible in maintaining transmission in the bat colony needs to be explored.","publish_time":"2018-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wacharapluesadee, Supaporn; Duengkae, Prateep; Chaiyes, Aingorn; Kaewpom, Thongchai; Rodpan, Apaporn; Yingsakmongkon, Sangchai; Petcharat, Sininat; Phengsakul, Patcharakiti; Maneeorn, Pattarapol; Hemachudha, Thiravat","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccde33bdca9b5c7f879f105a4596e5b1ad3f9408.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5819653.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-0950-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463282/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lyle"],"organizations":["Betacoronavirus","BCI"],"locations":["Chonburi"],"keyphrases":["detection of CoV","CoV detection","lylei bats","CoV outbreak","strain of CoV","adult bats","infection-age","foraging sites","uninfected bats","age-specific pattern of CoV infection","average BCI of CoV infected bats","S1","juveniles","S2","S3","Pteropus lylei","transmission","viral shedding","Alphacoronavirus","bat roost","adults","Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","detected CoVs","s roosts","viral reactivation","rectal swabs","parturition period","peripartum period","bat colony","group D betacoronavirus","total rectal swab positives","stress","prevalence","human dwellings","Chonburi province","structure model","coronaviruses","areas","mother","impact","novel viruses","natural reservoirs","Nested RT-PCR","Lyle\u2019s flying fox","fruit trees","proximity","sequencing","fact","open pig farm","Knowledge","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","humans","animals","forearm length","gender difference","ratio","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To examine the seriousness of the high-density problem, this study aims to survey the health and safety performance of apartment buildings in a densely populated city, Hong Kong, using a simplified assessment scheme. An assessment scheme based on a hierarchy of building performance indicators concerning the quality of: (a) architectural design, (b) building services design, (c) the surrounding environment, (d) operations and maintenance, and (e) management approaches was developed. One hundred forty (140) apartment buildings were surveyed and assessed through site inspections, desk searches, and interviews. A performance analysis was conducted to examine and compare the overall health and safety performance of the buildings. We found that there were considerable variations in health and safety conditions across buildings, even though they are located within a single district. Most of the variations in building health and safety conditions were attributed to differences in building management systems rather than building design. Enhancing strategic management approaches (e.g. a better delineation of owners\u2019 rights and duties) appears to be the most critical factor that underperformers should consider in order to improve their buildings.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Daniel Chi-Wing; Chau, Kwong-Wing; King-Chung Cheung, Alex; Yau, Yung; Wong, Siu-Kei; Leung, Hing-Fung; Siu-Yu Lau, Stephen; Wong, Wah-Sang","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3236f64261aaa7ebb89cbd7b3301d55a35211b9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126377.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288001/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132307000352; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2007.01.035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132307000352","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["building health","safety performance of apartment buildings","safety conditions","respect of health","overall health","building management systems","hierarchy of building performance indicators","performance analysis","services design","strategic management approaches","architectural design","high-density built environment","simplified assessment scheme","surrounding environment","considerable variations","high-density problem","challenges","Hong Kong","idea of sustainable development","better delineation of owners\u2019 rights","operations","populated city","differences","desk searches","duties","site inspections","maintenance","quality","SARS outbreak","underperformers","interviews","order","study","critical factor","seriousness","structural problems","single district"],"language":"en"},

Firstly, new ducts and side-branches thereof need to be established during pregnancy to generate an extensive ductal tree allowing the secretion and transport of milk. A second wave of remodelling occurs during mammary involution after weaning. We have analysed the role of the cell surface protease aminopeptidase N (Anpep, APN, CD13) during these processes using Anpep deficient and Anpep over-expressing mice. We find that APN deficiency significantly delays mammary gland morphogenesis during gestation. The defect is characterised by a reduction in alveolar buds and duct branching at mid-pregnancy. Conversely over-expression of Anpep leads to accelerated ductal development. This indicates that Anpep plays a critical role in the proteolytic remodelling of mammary tissue during adult mammary development.","publish_time":"2012-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kolb, Andreas F.; Sorrell, David; Lassnig, Caroline; Lillico, Simon; Carlisle, Ailsa; Neil, Claire; Robinson, Claire; M\u00FCller, Mathias; Whitelaw, C.

It reflects that diseases are not randomly distributed in the population and that individuals have certain characteristics that predispose to, or protect against, a variety of different diseases. Disease is the result of an epidemiological triad, where disease results from the interaction of: the human host, an infectious agent or toxin, and the environment that promotes the exposure. This chapter focuses on the use of epidemiology to identify the source of diseases caused by microorganisms or toxins. Microorganisms are very efficient at infecting humans, using a number of different strategies and mechanisms. The deliberate dissemination of a biological agent by many of these mechanisms presents the latest challenge to public health. It requires a careful epidemiologic investigation to determine whether an outbreak of infectious disease is because of the intentional release of an agent, or is naturally occurring. A number of molecular techniques have been developed for sub typing bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, which will facilitate this investigation as well as identify clusters of related microorganisms.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"MORSE, STEPHEN A.; KHAN, ALI S.","journal":"Microbial Forensics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da214d4b0e7f7bb7d851fe7d2d38b30989b097fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149997.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780120884834500111; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780120884834500111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious agent","study","determinants of health","mechanisms","biological agent","public health","outbreak of infectious disease","disease results","clusters of related microorganisms","health problems","source of diseases","variety of different diseases","number of different strategies","related states","use of epidemiology","Publisher Summary Epidemiology","number of molecular techniques","careful epidemiologic investigation","events","specied populations","sub","application","distribution","epidemiological triad","human host","infecting humans","viruses","fungi","interaction","latest challenge","intentional release","individuals","certain characteristics","bacteria","protozoa","environment","deliberate dissemination","chapter","toxins","exposure"],"language":"en"},

In order to anticipate the reinstatement of delayed interventions, surgical activity reduction analysis is essential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction of urological surgery in adult during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. Material: The data regarding urological procedures realized in the 8 academic urological departments of Parisians centres (AP-HP) were compared over two similar periods (14-29 March 2019 and 12-27 March 2020) using the centralized surgical planning software shared by these centres. Procedure title, type of surgery and outpatient ratio were collected. The interventions were sorted into 16 major families of urological interventions. Results: Overall, a 55% decrease was observed concerning urological procedures over the same period between 2019 and 2020 (995 and 444 procedures respectively). Oncology activity and emergencies decreased by 31% and 44%. The number of kidney transplantations decreased from 39 to 3 (-92%). Functional, andrological and genital surgical procedures were the most impacted among the non-oncological procedures (-85%, -81% and -71% respectively). Approximatively 1033 hours of surgery have been delayed during this 16-day period. Conclusion: Lockdown and postponement of non-urgent scheduled urological procedures decisions has led to a drastic decrease in surgical activity in AP-HP. Isolated Kidney transplantation has been stopped (national statement). Urologists must anticipate for lockdown exit in order to catch-up delayed surgeries.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinar, Ugo; Anract, Julien; Duquesne, Igor; Dariane, Charles; Chartier-Kastler, Emmanuel; Cussenot, Olivier; Desgrandchamps, Fran\u00E7ois; Hermieu, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Irani, Jacques; de La Taille, Alexandre; M\u00E9jean, Arnaud; Mongiat-Artus, Pierre; Peyromaure, Micha\u00EBl; Barrou, Benoit; Zerbib, Marc; Roupr\u00EAt, Morgan","journal":"Prog Urol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/305894b2518e07b31d2b4402fafe1b3e6c973b39.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32430140/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.purol.2020.05.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["genital surgical procedures","reduction of urological surgery","non-oncological procedures","non-emergency surgical activity","surgical activity reduction analysis","major families of urological interventions","postponement of non-urgent scheduled urological procedures decisions","Oncology activity","reinstatement of delayed interventions","academic urological departments of Parisians centres","Lockdown","centralized surgical planning software","type of surgery","pandemic","COVID","order","hours of surgery","catch-up delayed surgeries","AP-HP","drastic decrease","day period","Isolated Kidney transplantation","number of kidney transplantations","France","adult","andrological","Procedure title","outpatient ratio","Conclusion","Material","data","national statement","study","emergencies","similar periods","objective","Introduction","Urologists","Results"],"language":"en"},

Due to costly antibiotic treatment, and increasing resistance of pneumococcus, developing high-efficient protective vaccine against this pathogen is an urgent need. Although the pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and pneumonia conjugate vaccines (PCV) are the efficient pneumococcal vaccine in children and adult groups, but the serotype replacement of S. pneumoniae strains causes the reduction in efficacy of such vaccines. For overcoming the aforesaid drawbacks epitope-based vaccines are introduced as the relevant alternative. In our previous research, the epitope vaccine was designed based on immunodominant epitopes from PspA, CbpA antigens as cellular stimulants and PhtD, PiuA as humoral stimulants. Because the low immunogenicity is the main disadvantage of epitope vaccine, in the current study, we applied coiled-coil self-assembled structures for developing our vaccine. Recently, self-assembled peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) have gained much attention in the field of vaccine development due to their multivalency, self-adjuvanticity, biocompatibility, and size similarity to pathogen. In this regard, the final designed vaccine is comprised of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes from PspA and CbpA, helper T lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes from PhtD and PiuA, the pentamer and trimmer oligomeric domains form 5-stranded and 3-stranded coiled-coils as self-assembled scaffold, Diphtheria toxoids (DTD) as a universal T-helper, which fused to each other with appropriate linkers. The four different arrangements based on the order of above-mentioned compartments were constructed, and each of them were modeled, and validated to find the 3D structure. The structural, physicochemical, and immunoinformatics analyses of final vaccine construct represented that our vaccine could stimulate potent immune response against S. pneumoniae; however, the potency of that should be approved via various in vivo and in vitro immunological tests.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dorosti, Hesam; Eslami, Mahboobeh; Nezafat, Navid; Fadaei, Fardin; Ghasemi, Younes","journal":"Molecular and Cellular Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b86c590a17d44679d13f690c7eb082d56c195777.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126903.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2019.101446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520715/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850819303007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850819303007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine","final designed vaccine","efficient pneumococcal vaccine","main disadvantage of epitope vaccine","field of vaccine development","high-efficient protective vaccine","immunoinformatics analyses of final vaccine construct","pneumoniae strains","self-assembled scaffold","self-assembled structures","self-adjuvanticity","helper T lymphocytes","Abstract Streptococcus pneumoniae","self-assembled peptide nanoparticles","aforesaid drawbacks epitope-based vaccines","PspA","PhtD","immunodominant epitopes","cytotoxic T lymphocytes","PiuA","universal T-helper","children","pathogen","pneumonia conjugate vaccines","CbpA antigens","cellular stimulants","humoral stimulants","coiled-coils","main cause of diseases","HTL","adult groups","pentamer","biocompatibility","DTD","Diphtheria toxoids","PCV","CTL","PPV","resistance of pneumococcus","serotype replacement","meningitis","SAPNs","multivalency","trimmer oligomeric domains form","size similarity","attention","sepsis","reduction","efficacy","potent immune response","current study","low immunogenicity","costly antibiotic treatment","order of above-mentioned compartments","previous research","regard","different arrangements","old people","relevant alternative","urgent need","immunological tests","appropriate linkers","potency"],"language":"en"},

Recently, we demonstrated that a recombinant MVTT expressing the spike glycoprotein of SARS\u2010CoV (namely MVTT\u2010S) is superior to the non\u2010replicating modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA\u2010S) for inducing high level of neutralizing antibodies through mucosal vaccination. In this study, we further determined the tissue tropism and safety of MVTT\u2010S after the vaccine was administrated through various routes including: intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), and intravaginal (i.vag.) inoculations, respectively. Using real\u2010time PCR, nested PCR, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization assays, we found that MVTT\u2010S was able to produce a transient infection in all cases within 48 hr post\u2010inoculation, yet the major site of viral replication in various tissues or organs was dependent on the route of viral administration. We demonstrated that i.m. injection of MVTT\u2010S primarily targeted draining inguinal lymph nodes, whereas mucosal inoculation had broader range of tissue infections. i.n. inoculation involved infections in lungs, kidneys, spleens and cervix lymph nodes while i.vag. administration targeted uteruses, ovaries, kidneys and spleens. Critically, the infection did not cause severe pathogenic consequences in infected tissues, which was consistent to the attenuated phenotype of MVTT\u2010S.

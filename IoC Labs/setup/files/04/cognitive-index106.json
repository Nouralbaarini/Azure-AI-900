Non-human primate (NHP) models for malaria are admittedly under-used, although they are probably closer models than mice for human malaria; in particular, NHP models allow the use of human pathogens (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi). NHPs, whether natural hosts or experimentally challenged with a simian Plasmodium, can also serve as robust pre-clinical models. Some simian parasites are closely related to a human counterpart, with which they may share a common ancestor, and display similar major features with the human infection and pathology. NHP models allow longitudinal studies, from the early events following sporozoite inoculation to the later events, including analysis of organs and tissues, particularly liver, spleen, brain and bone marrow. NHP models have one other significant advantage over mouse models: NHPs are our closest relatives and thus their biology is very similar to ours. Recently developed in vivo imaging tools have provided insight into malaria parasite infection and disease in mouse models. One advantage of these tools is that they limit the need for invasive procedures, such as tissue biopsies. Many such technologies are now available for NHP studies and provide new opportunities for elucidating host/parasite interactions. The aim of this review is to bring the malaria community up to date on what is currently possible and what soon will be, in terms of in vivo imaging in NHP models of malaria, to consider the pros and the cons of the various techniques, and to identify challenges.","publish_time":"2014-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beignon, Anne-Sophie; Le Grand, Roger; Chapon, Catherine","journal":"Parasitology International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a0512f674192c9d6b90e0d6e44fa68b8db06fbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108422.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383576913001323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24042056/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2013.09.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1383576913001323","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NHP models of malaria","mouse models","human malaria","closer models","Abstract Animal models of malaria","NHP studies","human infection","malaria community","simian Plasmodium","malaria parasite infection","robust pre-clinical models","Plasmodium vivax","Plasmodium falciparum","Plasmodium malariae","Plasmodium knowlesi","human counterpart","use of human pathogens","Non-human primate","parasite interactions","mice","NHPs","imaging tools","elucidating host","later events","knowledge of host","early events","longitudinal studies","pathogen interactions","significant advantage","simian parasites","similar major features","new opportunities","insight","disease","immune responses","spleen","sporozoite inoculation","analysis of organs","closest relatives","invasive procedures","brain","drug","tissues","large contribution","various techniques","bone marrow","common ancestor","cons","tissue biopsies","need","biology","review","date","pros","pathology","technologies","terms of","vaccine design","natural hosts","challenges","aim"],"language":"en"},

The infection of target cells by the SARS CoV is mediated through the interaction of the viral Spike (S) protein (1255 amino acids) and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (amino acids N318\u2013T509 of S protein) harbors an extended excursion along its periphery that contacts ACE2 and is designated the receptor-binding motif (RBM, amino acids S432\u2013T486). In addition, the RBM is a major antigenic determinant, able to elicit production of neutralizing antibodies. Hence, the role of the RBM is a bi-functional bioactive surface that can be demonstrated by antibodies such as the neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody (mAb) 80R which targets the RBM and competes with the ACE2 receptor for binding. Here, we employ phage-display peptide-libraries to reconstitute a functional RBM. This is achieved by generating a vast collection of candidate RBM peptides that present a diversity of conformations. Screening such \u2018Conformer Libraries\u2019 with corresponding ligands has produced short RBM constructs (ca. 40 amino acids) that can bind both the ACE2 receptor and the neutralizing mAb 80R.","publish_time":"2015-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freund, Natalia T.; Roitburd-Berman, Anna; Sui, Jianhua; Marasco, Wayne A.; Gershoni, Jonathan M.","journal":"Protein Eng Des Sel","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4809b01edea8239cfc5fbdb65da3388e1f8876c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107155.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26487711/; https://doi.org/10.1093/protein/gzv052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS CoV","RBM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functional RBM","ACE2 receptor","SARS CoV receptor-binding domain","amino acids N318","amino acids S432","short RBM constructs","receptor-binding motif","cellular receptor","neutralizing mAb","contacts ACE2","vast collection of candidate RBM peptides","production of neutralizing antibodies","neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody","T509 of S protein","bi-functional bioactive surface","corresponding ligands","extended excursion","severe acute respiratory syndrome","major antigenic determinant","coronavirus","interaction","Conformer Libraries\u2019","periphery","viral Spike","angiotensin","enzyme","T486","phage-display peptide-libraries","infection of target cells","Screening","diversity of conformations","addition","role","people"],"language":"en"},

Macrodomains, which are functionally promiscuous, have been studied intensively for the past decade due to their importance in the regulation of cellular responses to DNA damage, chromatin remodeling, transcription and tumorigenesis. Recent structural, phylogenetic and biological analyses, however, suggest the need for some reconsideration of the evolutionary advantage of concentrating such a plethora of diverse functions into the macrodomain and of how macrodomains could perform so many functions.

We report the clinical presentation, contact, and environmental investigations of a patient infected with this virus, and assess the origin and genetic characteristics of the isolated virus. METHODS: A 20-year-old woman with an influenza-like illness presented to a hospital with shortness of breath in May, 2013. An unsubtyped influenza A virus was isolated from her throat-swab specimen and was transferred to the Taiwan Centres for Disease Control (CDC) for identification. The medical records were reviewed to assess the clinical presentation. We did a contact and environmental investigation and collected clinical specimens from the case and symptomatic contacts to test for influenza virus. The genomic sequences of the isolated virus were determined and characterised. FINDINGS: The unsubtyped influenza A virus was identified as the H6N1 subtype, based on sequences of the genes encoding haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The source of infection was not established. Sequence analyses showed that this human isolate was highly homologous to chicken H6N1 viruses in Taiwan and had been generated through interclade reassortment. Notably, the virus had a G228S substitution in the haemagglutinin protein that might increase its affinity for the human \u03B12-6 linked sialic acid receptor. INTERPRETATION: This is the first report of human infection with a wild avian influenza A H6N1 virus. A unique clade of H6N1 viruses with a G228S substitution of haemagglutinin have circulated persistently in poultry in Taiwan. These viruses continue to evolve and accumulate changes, increasing the potential risk of human-to-human transmission. Our report highlights the continuous need for preparedness for a pandemic of unpredictable and complex avian influenza.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus, is a promising vaccine vector against human and veterinary pathogens. Avirulent NDV strains LaSota and B1 have long track records of safety and efficacy. Therefore, use of these strains as vaccine vectors is highly safe in avian and non-avian species. NDV replicates efficiently in the respiratory track of the host and induces strong local and systemic immune responses against the foreign antigen. As a vaccine vector, NDV can accommodate foreign sequences with a good degree of stability and as a RNA virus, there is limited possibility for recombination with host cell DNA. Using NDV as a vaccine vector in humans offers several advantages over other viral vaccine vectors. NDV is safe in humans due to host range restriction and there is no pre-existing antibody to NDV in the human population. NDV is antigenically distinct from common human pathogens.

We sought a common denominator in lung transplant recipients, analyzing risk factors that trigger immune responses that lead to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Methods We collected blood from patients who underwent lung transplant at our institution. Exosomes were isolated from the sera of recipients with risk factors for chronic rejection and from stable recipients. Exosomes were analyzed with western blot, using antibodies to lung self-antigens K alpha 1 tubulin and collagen-V, costimulatory molecules (costimulatory molecule 80, costimulatory molecule 86), transcription factors (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03B1, Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator), and 20S proteasome. Results Of the 90 patients included, we identified 5 with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, 5 without, 15 with respiratory viral infection, 10 with acute rejection, 10 with donor-specific antibodies (DSA), 5 without DSA, and 10 who were stable for exosome isolation. Recipients with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, respiratory viral infection, acute rejection, and DSA had exosomes containing self-antigens; exosomes from stable recipients did not. Exosomes from recipients with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, acute rejection, and DSA also demonstrated costimulatory molecule 80, costimulatory molecule 86, major histocompatibility complex class II, transcription factor, and 20S proteasome. Conclusions Transplanted lungs with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, symptomatic respiratory viral infection, acute rejection, and immune responses induce exosomes that contain self-antigens, costimulatory molecules, major histocompatibility complex class II, transcription factors, and 20S proteasome.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) involved excessive inflammatory response to IAV infection profoundly contributes to the virus pathogenesis. However, the precise mechanisms underlying such a response are poorly understood. Here we found from both in vivo and in vitro studies that IAV not only induced a surge of IL-6 release, but also greatly upregulated expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), the potent suppressor of IL-6-associated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. Interestingly, there existed a cytokine-independent mechanism of the robust induction of SOCS3 by IAV at early stages of the infection. Furthermore, we employed SOCS3-knockdown transgenic mice (TG), and surprisingly observed from virus challenge experiments using these mice that disruption of SOCS3 expression provided significant protection against IAV infection, as evidenced by attenuated acute lung injury, a higher survival rate of infected animals and lower viral load in infected tissues as compared with those of wild-type littermates under the same condition. The activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF\u03BAB) and the expression of its target gene IL-6 were suppressed in SOCS3-knockdown A549 cells and the TG mice after infection with IAV. Moreover, we defined that enhanced STAT3 activity caused by SOCS3 silencing was important for the regulation of NF\u03BAB and IL-6. These findings establish a critical role for IL-6-STAT3-SOCS3 axis in the pathogenesis of IAV and suggest that influenza virus may have evolved a strategy to circumvent IL-6/STAT3-mediated immune response through upregulating SOCS3.","publish_time":"2019-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Shasha; Yan, Ruoxiang; Chen, Biao; Pan, Qidong; Chen, Yuhai; Hong, Jinxuan; Zhang, Lianfeng; Liu, Wenjun; Wang, Song; Chen, Ji-Long","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3669fc36015db30aaecba5e7d608584d9a2cdfa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6706793.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474976/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01843","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TG","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IAV infection","SOCS3 silencing","upregulating SOCS3","pathogenesis of IAV","STAT3-SOCS3 axis","disruption of SOCS3 expression","surge of IL","SOCS3-knockdown transgenic mice","robust induction of SOCS3","potent suppressor of IL","SOCS3-knockdown A549 cells","target gene IL","virus pathogenesis","influenza virus","TG mice","enhanced STAT3 activity","upregulated expression of suppressor","immune response","virus challenge experiments","excessive inflammatory response","infected tissues","regulation of NF\u03BAB","cytokine-independent mechanism","higher survival rate of infected animals","activity of nuclear factor-kappa B","lower viral load","significant protection","associated signal transducer","world","acute lung injury","activator of transcription","major public health threat","early stages","release","critical role","wild-type littermates","findings","strategy","severe pneumonia","condition","precise mechanisms","Interleukin","studies"],"language":"en"},

We have shown that infection with RbCV results in the development of myocarditis and congestive heart failure and that some survivors of RbCV infection go on to develop dilated cardiomyopathy in the chronic phase. Serial ECGs were recorded on 31 RbCV-infected rabbits. Measurements of heart rate; P-R interval; QRS duration; QTc interval; and P-, QRS-, and T-wave voltages were taken. The recordings were also examined for disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. The acute and subacute phases were characterized by sinus tachycardia with depressed R- and T-wave voltages as well as disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. In most animals in the chronic phase, the sinus rate returned to near-baseline values with resolution of the QRS voltage changes. The ECG changes observed during RbCV infection are similar to the spectrum of interval/segment abnormalities, rhythm disturbances, conduction defects, and myocardial pathology seen in human myocarditis, heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Because animals often died suddenly in the absence of severe clinical signs of congestive heart failure during the acute phase, RbCV infection may increase ventricular vulnerability, resulting in sudden cardiac death. RbCV infection may provide a rare opportunity to study sudden cardiac death in an animal model in which the ventricle is capable of supporting ventricular fibrillation, and invasive techniques monitoring cardiac function can be performed.","publish_time":"1999-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alexander, Lorraine K.; Keene, Bruce W.; Yount, Boyd L.; Geratz, Joachim Dieter; Small, J.David; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"Journal of Electrocardiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89c1764db023518c70301bd34aa180d8c5d98e51.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022073699900183; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022073699900183","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["survivors of RbCV infection","RbCV results","disturbances of conduction","rhythm disturbances","RbCV-infected rabbits","chronic phase","ECG changes","P-R interval","Measurements of heart rate","sudden cardiac death","QRS voltage changes","spectrum of interval","QTc interval","QRS duration","sinus rate","conduction defects","cardiac function","dilated cardiomyopathy","T-wave voltages","repolarization","animals","study","absence of severe clinical signs of congestive heart failure","development of myocarditis","depressed R","ventricular fibrillation","human myocarditis","ventricular vulnerability","sinus tachycardia","segment abnormalities","resolution","myocardial pathology","rare opportunity","near-baseline values","animal model","rabbit coronavirus","ventricle","invasive techniques","subacute phases","Serial ECGs","recordings"],"language":"en"},

Conditions of modern life, some of them related to or being the result of globalization, ensure that factors responsible for disease emergence are more prevalent than ever. Categorization of the factors is somewhat arbitrary but are representative of the underlying processes that cause emergence. Major responsible factors include ecological changes, such as changes due to agriculture or economic development or to anomalies in climates, human demographical changes and behaviour, travel and commerce, technology and industry, microbial adaptation and change, and the breakdown of public health measures (Morse, Emerg. Infect. Dis., 1, 1995, 7). Furtheron, concerning pathogens, their most striking feature emerging and re\u2010emerging is their diversity, ranging from viruses and prions, over bacteria and rickettsia, fungi, protozoa to helminths. As presently the epidemiological perspective does not permit reliable prediction and prevention of most damaging new pathogens, and as the evolutionary perspective only provides rough theoretical estimates for selective processes in pathogen populations, surveillance and monitoring remain the most important methods to recognize early that \u2018something has happened\u2019. In light of the complexity and diversity of likely new emerging diseases, such surveillance may be more broadly targeted and aimed more realistically at early recognition of disease syndromes rather than at identifying microbial diseases.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to estimate the effect of influenza and RSV on excess hospitalizations for acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) in children aged \u22645. METHODS: Retrospective, population\u2010based study was performed for five seasons (2006\u20132011). Slovenian national hospital discharge data and surveillance data were used to estimate the effect of influenza and/or RSV on ALRTI hospitalizations (acute bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and acute bronchitis) using rate difference method. RESULTS: An excess was observed in average weekly ALRTI hospitalizations per 100 000 among children aged \u22645 in all five seasons during influenza and/or RSV active period. During three seasons, there was higher excess in ALRTI hospitalizations in the period when influenza/RSV cocirculated compared with the RSV period. In pandemic season (2009/2010), the only one without influenza/RSV overlap, excess hospitalization was higher in RSV period. The highest excess of hospitalizations was found among the youngest children (0\u20105 months old). In all five seasons, acute bronchiolitis was the most common ALRTI recorded in hospitalized young children. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory syncytial viruses was leading viral pathogen associated with ALRTI hospitalizations in children aged \u22645. The cocirculation of influenza virus increased the burden of ALRTI hospitalizations especially in seasons with A(H3) predominance.","publish_time":"2013-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"U\u010Dakar, Veronika; So\u010Dan, Maja; Trilar, Katarina Prosenc","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06d7c3e1e46a199332798bd18e31d49787b39f99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4634267.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23782430/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["excess hospitalizations","RSV period","burden of ALRTI hospitalizations","seasons","RSV overlap","effect of influenza","highest excess of hospitalizations","RSV active period","common ALRTI","average weekly ALRTI hospitalizations","higher excess","acute bronchiolitis","cocirculation of influenza virus","youngest children","acute bronchitis","respiratory syncytial viruses","hospitalized young children","acute lower respiratory tract infections","surveillance data","important viral pathogens","Slovenian national hospital discharge data","pneumonia","based study","Retrospective","population","rate difference method","BACKGROUND","METHODS","childhood","CONCLUSIONS","months old","aim","H3","predominance","pandemic season","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Since angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease, thus they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, we hypothesize that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-COV2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brojakowska, Agnieszka; Narula, Jagat; Shimony, Rony; Bander, Jeffrey","journal":"J Am Coll Cardiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da87d746da07b29ae9513e4a0b5ed4867f8cca35.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305401/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735109720350014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109720350014?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 receptor expression","SARS-CoV infections","increased ACE2 activity","receptor blockers","benefits of treatment","anti-inflammatory benefits","Ang1","viral disease","cardiovascular disease","disease protection","renin-angiotensin system inhibitors","Mas axis downregulation","Abstract SARS-CoV2 host cell infection","mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists","ACE inhibitors","demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement","MRAs","ARBs","binding","upregulation","agents","high-risk patients","Systemic dysregulation","enzyme","use","risks"],"language":"en"},

While HeV is confined to Australia, more recent NiV outbreaks have been reported in Bangladesh, India and the Philippines. The clinical manifestations of both henipaviruses in humans appear similar, with a predominance of an acute encephalitic syndrome. Likewise, the pathological features are similar and characterized by disseminated, multi\u2010organ vasculopathy comprising endothelial infection/ulceration, vasculitis, vasculitis\u2010induced thrombosis/occlusion, parenchymal ischemia/microinfarction, and parenchymal cell infection in the central nervous system (CNS), lung, kidney and other major organs. This unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis\u2010induced microinfarction and neuronal infection causes severe tissue damage in the CNS. Both viruses can also cause relapsing encephalitis months and years after the acute infection.

Modelling, which is like any other hypothesis-driven approach, aims to develop a better understanding of biological phenomena. However, diseases processes generally, and particularly those related to transmission, will in many cases be imperfectly understood or too complex to systematically describe, so models will necessarily be simplifications of the overall system. It is essential, therefore, that models are designed carefully and used appropriately. Key to this is identifying what specific questions a model might be expected to answer and what data is available to inform the model. A particular type of model might be fine for one particular situation but highly inappropriate for another. It is also important to appreciate and communicate what simplifications and assumptions have had to be made and how this might affect the robustness of the modelling results. It is also particularly important to understand that models frequently make what can be hidden assumptions about underlying processes because of the way they have been constructed and these assumptions also need to be carefully considered and made explicit, particularly for non-expert audiences. This chapter, therefore, provides a brief introduction to some of these aspects of epidemic modelling for those that might be less familiar with them.","publish_time":"2010-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leach, Steve; Hall, Ian","journal":"Diagnostic Virology Protocols","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0332a68a1f00f80bc0c76cc6c191f9c67bb53001.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120695.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-60761-817-1_23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21116814/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mathematical models","particular type of model","simplifications","hidden assumptions","modelling results","aspects of epidemic modelling","particular situation","underlying processes","diseases processes","infectious disease data","useful insights","possible future impacts of potential emerging epidemics","better understanding of biological phenomena","non-expert audiences","way","brief introduction","specific questions","hypothesis-driven approach","cases","overall system","robustness","transmission","chapter","Key"],"language":"en"},

Patients and methods We prospectively included all adult and pediatric patients admitted to Necker hospital (Paris) between October 2018 and February 2019 with a diagnosis of RSV-associated ALRI. We compared characteristics of ALRIs between patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial infections and, in each group, between children and adults. Results Community-acquired and nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs were diagnosed in 229 and 11 inpatients, respectively. The burden of community-acquired infections was higher in children than in adults: 2.1% versus 0.2% of the total number of pediatric and adult inpatients, respectively (p \u003C 0.0001); 4.2% versus 0.2% of the total number of hospitalization days in pediatric and adult units, respectively (p \u003C 0.0001). Compared to inpatients with community-acquired ALRIs, those with nosocomial infections were more frequently adults (45.5% versus 2.6%, p = 0.0005) and subjects with at least one chronic complex condition (100.0% versus 41.0%, p \u003C 0.0001). The total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial ALRIs was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p \u003C 0.0001). Conclusions Nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs rarely occurred, suggesting a good effectiveness of our infection control strategy. However, the burden of nosocomial infection was higher in adults than in children, suggesting that education and training of healthcare personnel, patients and visitors about the risk of nosocomial RSV infections should be reinforced in adult wards.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frange, Pierre; Toubiana, Julie; Parize, Perrine; Moulin, Florence; Scemla, Anne; Leruez-Ville, Marianne","journal":"Infection Prevention in Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f738928dba37be9b02edcdaf480cc8c653614585.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590088920300056; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590088920300056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nosocomial ALRIs","nosocomial infections","adults","Conclusions Nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs","risk of nosocomial RSV infections","burden of nosocomial infection","pediatric patients","adult inpatients","burden of community","children","characteristics of ALRIs","total number of pediatric","adult units","diagnosis of RSV","adult wards","Results Community","total number of hospitalization days","acute lower respiratory tract infections","infection control strategy","effectiveness of existing infection control measures","good effectiveness","Necker hospital","respiratory syncytial virus","French tertiary hospital","visitors","training of healthcare personnel","education","subjects","group","chronic complex condition","Paris","Summary Objective","methods"],"language":"en"},

These are abundantly found in plants, animals and many other species and are known to agglutinate various blood groups of erythrocytes. Further, due to the unique carbohydrate recognition property, lectins have been extensively used in many biological functions that make use of protein-carbohydrate recognition like detection, isolation and characterization of glycoconjugates, histochemistry of cells and tissues, tumor cell recognition and many more. In this review, we have summarized the immunomodulatory effects of plant lectins and their effects against diseases, including antimicrobial action. We found that many plant lectins mediate its microbicidal activity by triggering host immune responses that result in the release of several cytokines followed by activation of effector mechanism. Moreover, certain lectins also enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages during microbial infections. Lectins along with heat killed microbes can act as vaccine to provide long term protection from deadly microbes. Hence, lectin based therapy can be used as a better substitute to fight microbial diseases efficiently in future.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mishra, Abtar; Behura, Assirbad; Mawatwal, Shradha; Kumar, Ashish; Naik, Lincoln; Mohanty, Subhashree Subhasmita; Manna, Debraj; Dokania, Puja; Mishra, Amit; Patra, Samir K.; Dhiman, Rohan","journal":"Food and Chemical Toxicology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6e2788b9dc61518de1393680c77e231ff53a037.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115788.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278691519306179; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691519306179; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.110827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542433/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abstract Lectins","certain lectins","immunomodulatory effects of plant lectins","microbial diseases","unique carbohydrate recognition property","tumor cell recognition","microbicidal activity","microbial infections","deadly microbes","various sugar structures","phagocytic activity of macrophages","various blood groups of erythrocytes","histochemistry of cells","reversible linkages","interaction","characterization of glycoconjugates","tissues","high degree of stereospecificity","isolation","detection","use of protein","vaccine","long term protection","proteins","host immune responses","cytokines","release","glyco-conjugate complexes","better substitute","activation of effector mechanism","biological functions","species","antimicrobial action","heat","plants","animals","therapy","future","review"],"language":"en"},

The interquartile range (IQR) score for knowledge is 18.0 (6.0), the mean scores of attitude and practice are 32.65 (4.72) and 25.30 (4.9). respectively. Significant and negative linear correlations between knowledge and practice (r = \u22120.232, p \u003C 0.001), and attitude and practice (r = 0.134, p = 0.045) were observed. Results from the current study showed good knowledge of RTIs among Malaysian pilgrims. However, a poor attitude was reflected in their preventive practice behaviors. This will further help in the prevention and management of RTIs during Hajj and Umrah. Therefore, an extensive educational health campaign should be provided to pilgrims to create awareness.","publish_time":"2019-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dauda Goni, Mohammed; Hasan, Habsah; Naing, Nyi Nyi; Wan-Arfah, Nadiah; Zeiny Deris, Zakuan; Nor Arifin, Wan; Abubakar Baaba, Aisha","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfbb7bb506552b06794dbcefe56911e2a91a908b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6888533.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16224569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752224/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Makkah"],"keyphrases":["Hajj pilgrims","Umrah pilgrims","practice of Malaysian Hajj","Malaysian pilgrims","good knowledge of RTIs","prevention of RTIs","poor attitude","preventive practice behaviors","mean scores of attitude","private Hajj","RTI prevention","Umrah companies","management of RTIs","current study","cross-sectional study","negative linear correlations","major public health challenge","extensive educational health campaign","weekly orientation course","Muslim pilgrimage","validated self-administered questionnaire","IQR","KAP","interquartile range","Respiratory tract infection","Makkah","respondents","female","SD","Results","participants","years","domains","awareness"],"language":"en"},

However, several studies have indicated that influenza C virus causes severe acute respiratory illness and pneumonia in all ages. Objective We conducted a study to identify influenza C virus among young children in South Korea.Study design. From October 2013 to September 2016, 973 young children with influenzalike illness (ILI) were enrolled at three university hospitals. We tested nasopharyngeal samples for 16 types of respiratory viruses. Among the tested samples, 564 were positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Except for the samples where 16 types of respiratory viruses were found, 409 negative samples were examined for the presence of influenza C virus, using a matrix gene specific primer set. Results Among 409 nasopharyngeal samples, five influenza C viruses were detected. The manifestation of influenza C virus infection in young children was observed acute respiratory illness, such as fever, rhinorrhea, and cough, but no pneumonia or severe respiratory illness. Nucleotide sequencing was conducted and a phylogenetic tree was generated. We found that C/Sao Paulo/387/82-like lineage viruses circulated in South Korea, and the fully sequenced virus (C/Seoul/APD462/2015) was closely related to C/Victoria/2/2012 and C/Tokyo/4/2014 strains. Conclusions This study was the first report of influenza C virus detection in South Korea. Although severe illness was not observed in this study, we suggest the necessity for influenza C virus testing in pediatric patients with ILI, considering other reports of severe illnesses caused by influenza C virus infections.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Han Sol; Lim, Sooyeon; Noh, Ji Yun; Song, Joon Young; Cheong, Hee Jin; Lee, Jung Hwa; Woo, Sung Il; Kim, Woo Joo","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1afff219f11d2a1a11cc75d12db262630290569.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106441.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2019.03.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653219300721; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653219300721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30978620/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["influenza C viruses","influenza C virus testing","presence of influenza C virus","influenza C virus infections","report of influenza C virus detection","manifestation of influenza C virus infection","Abstract Background Influenza C virus","sequenced virus","severe respiratory illness","types of respiratory viruses","severe acute respiratory illness","tested samples","lineage viruses","nasopharyngeal samples","orB viruses","young children","South Korea","influenzalike illness","negative samples","Study design","ILI","reports of severe illnesses","pneumonia","pediatric patients","matrix gene specific primer set","fever","necessity","cough","Seoul","Sao Paulo","rhinorrhea","Tokyo","ages","APD462","Victoria","studies","Nucleotide sequencing","phylogenetic tree","Conclusions","strains","Results","university hospitals","clinical practices","Objective"],"language":"en"},

In this study, 13 recombinant proteins associated with four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) and five putative uncharacterized proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a and 9b) of the SARS-CoV were prepared and used for screening and monitoring their specific IgG antibodies in SARS patient sera by protein microarray. Antibodies to proteins S, 3a, N and 9b were detected in the sera from convalescent-phase SARS patients, whereas those to proteins E, M, 3b, 6 and 7a were undetected.

Confirmed modes of viral transmission are primarily, but not exclusively, contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and aerosolization. Evidence-based improvement strategies for attenuation of residual environmental contamination involve a combination of deep cleaning with surface disinfectants and ultraviolet light (UV-C). (1) Place alcohol-based hand rubs on the intravenous (IV) pole to the left of the provider. Double glove during induction. (2) Place a wire basket lined with a zip closure plastic bag on the IV pole to the right of the provider. Place all contaminated instruments in the bag (eg, laryngoscope blades and handles) and close. Designate and maintain clean and dirty areas. After induction of anesthesia, wipe down all equipment and surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol. Use a top-down cleaning sequence adequate to reduce bioburden. Treat operating rooms using UV-C. (3) Decolonize patients using preprocedural chlorhexidine wipes, 2 doses of nasal povidone-iodine within 1 hour of incision, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse. (4) Create a closed lumen IV system and use hub disinfection. (5) Provide data feedback by surveillance of Enterococcus, Staphylococcusaureus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE)transmission. (6) To reduce the use of surgical masks and to reduce potential COVID-19 exposure, use relatively long (eg, 12hours) staff shifts. If there are 8 essential cases to be done (each lasting 1\u20132 hours), the ideal solution is to have 2 teams complete the 8 cases, not 8 first case starts. (7) Do 1 case in each operating room daily, with terminal cleaning after each case including UV-C or equivalent.

METHODS: From February 29\u2013May 29, 2016, we actively identified and enrolled patients in two hospitals with acute respiratory infections (ARI) that met all PUE case criteria. We reviewed medical records for documented exposure history associated with respiratory infectious diseases, collected throat samples that were tested for seasonal and avian influenza, and interviewed clinicians regarding reasons for reporting or not reporting PUE cases. We described and analyzed the proportion of PUE cases reported and clinician awareness of and practices related to the PUE system. RESULTS: Of 2619 ARI admissions in two hospitals, 335(13%) met the PUE case definition; none were reported. Of 311 specimens tested, 18(6%) were seasonal influenza virus-positive; none were avian influenza-positive. \u003C 10% PUE case medical records documented whether or not there were exposures to animals or others with respiratory illness.

During the past few years, insights into human CDI epidemiology changed and C. difficile is also considered as an emerging community-acquired pathogen. Certain ribotypes (RT) are possibly associated with zoonotic transmission. The objective of this study was to assess the presence of C. difficile in a population of pets and to characterise the isolates. RESULTS: Faecal samples from a total of 90 diarrhoeic dogs and 24 from exotic animal species (both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic) were analysed. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 6 (6.7%) dogs and one reptile sample (4.2%). Four (66.7%) of the six dog strains were capable of producing toxins. Four known different RTs were detected in dogs (010, 014, 123 and 358) and a new one was found in a faecal sample of an exotic animal. This new RT isolate was negative for all toxin genes tested and belonged to sequence type 347 which has been proposed as a Clade-III member. Importantly, two dog strains showed a stable resistance to metronidazole (initial MIC values: 128 and 48 \u03BCg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implementation of antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance programs to assess the prevalence of metronidazole resistance in dogs; molecular studies to elucidate C. difficile metronidazole resistance mechanisms are warranted. Based on the similarity between the ribotypes observed in dogs and those described in humans, the zoonotic transmission should be further explored. Furthermore, exotic animals have shown to harbor uncommon C. difficile strains which require further genomic studies.

STEM has been used to study variations in transmission of seasonal influenza in Israel by strains; evaluate social distancing measures taken to curb the H1N1 epidemic in Mexico City; study measles outbreaks in part of London and inform local policy on immunization; and gain insights into H7N9 avian influenza transmission in China. A multistrain dengue fever model explored the roles of the mosquito vector, cross-strain immunity, and antibody response in the frequency of dengue outbreaks. STEM has also been used to study the impact of variations in climate on malaria incidence. During the Ebola epidemic, a weekly conference call supported the global modeling community; subsequent work modeled the impact of behavioral change and tested disease reintroduction via animal reservoirs. Work in Germany tracked salmonella in pork from farm to fork; and a recent doctoral dissertation used the air travel feature to compare the potential threats posed by weaponizing infectious diseases. Current projects include work in Great Britain to evaluate control strategies for parasitic disease in sheep, and in Germany and Hungary, to validate the model and inform policy decisions for African swine fever. STEM Version 4.0.0, released in early 2019, includes tools used in these projects and updates technical aspects of the framework to ease its use and re-use.","publish_time":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Douglas, Judith V.; Bianco, Simone; Edlund, Stefan; Engelhardt, Tekla; Filter, Matthias; G\u00FCnther, Taras; Hu, Kun (Maggie); Nixon, Emily J.; Sevilla, Nereyda L.; Swaid, Ahmad; Kaufman, James H.","journal":"Health Secur","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7788ab137f05cf1c247c60dbe388b80fb5764a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6708268.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2019.0018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433284/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Eclipse Foundation"],"locations":["Israel","Mexico City","London","China","Germany","Hungary"],"keyphrases":["STEM Version","control outbreaks of infectious disease","parasitic disease","specific disease","global community of researchers","study measles outbreaks","global modeling community","tested disease reintroduction","subsequent work","impact of variations","frequency of dengue outbreaks","multistrain dengue fever model","Current projects","Germany","integration of community models","transmission of seasonal influenza","review of multiple projects","control strategies","H1N1 epidemic","H7N9 avian influenza transmission","modular framework","policy decisions","animal reservoirs","animal populations","Ebola epidemic","local policy","re-use","impact of behavioral change","weaponizing infectious diseases","African swine fever","reusable plug-in components","roles","potential threats","air travel feature","Great Britain","cross-strain immunity","strains","denominator data","antibody response","Israel","exchange","insights","sheep","London","Mexico City","human","mosquito vector","weekly conference","open source software project","recent doctoral dissertation","immunization","Eclipse Foundation","social distancing measures","public health officials","updates technical aspects","farm","climate","China","salmonella","pork","malaria incidence","Spatiotemporal Epidemiologic Modeler","capabilities","Hungary","tools"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In total, 44 children aged 0 to 24 months with febrile UTI and 35 age- and sex-matched controls with fever from other causes were enrolled in the study. ELISA was performed to determine the level of YKL-40 in urine collected from each child. RESULTS: The ratio of urinary YKL-40 to creatinine (Cr) was higher in the children with a UTI than in the controls (P\u003C0.001). The area under the ROC curve for detecting UTI was 0.88 for the urinary YKL-40/Cr ratio, 0.86 for pyuria, and 0.71 for positive nitrite on urinalysis. We applied a cut-off value of 125.23 pg/mg to urinary YKL-40/Cr for detecting UTI. Eight of nine children in the control group with pyuria had urinary YKL-40/Cr levels lower than 125.23 pg/mg, and the one child in the UTI group without pyuria or positive nitrite had a urinary YKL-40/Cr level greater than 125.23 pg/mg. CONCLUSIONS: Determining the levels of urinary YKL-40/Cr may help identify true cases of UTI in febrile young children, especially when they have pyuria but not nitrite, or have neither pyuria nor nitrite in the urine.","publish_time":"2017-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyun Hee; Chung, Mi Hae; Bin, Joong Hyun; Cho, Kyoung Soon; Lee, Juyoung; Suh, Jin-Soon","journal":"Ann Lab Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/404f219ad630336f512bb52d5e6b357adf10e130.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5700145.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3343/alm.2018.38.1.39; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29071817/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["levels of urinary YKL","ratio of urinary YKL","febrile UTI","level of YKL","pyuria","UTI group","Cr ratio","febrile children","urinary tract infection","true cases of UTI","Cr level greater","Cr levels lower","febrile young children","pg","positive nitrite","urine","control group","sex-matched controls","age","causes","fever","CONCLUSIONS","association","months","creatinine","ROC curve","RESULTS","known marker of inflammation","area","cut-off value","METHODS","total","urinalysis","study","ELISA","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

This study proposes a dynamic statistical model to estimate the daily number of new cases and the daily cumulative number of infected cases, which was then applied to historic dengue fever data. METHODS: The duration between the date of disease onset and date of laboratory confirmation was assumed to follow a gamma distribution or a nonparametric distribution. A conditional probability of a case being a real case among the unconfirmed cases on a given date was then calculated. This probability along with the observed confirmed cases was integrated to estimate the daily number of new cases and the cumulative number of infected cases. RESULTS: The distribution of the onset-to-confirmation time for the positive cases was different from that of the negative cases. The daily new cases and cumulative epidemic curves estimated by the proposed method have a lower absolute relative bias than the values estimated solely based on the available daily-confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: The proposed method provides a more accurate real-time estimation of the daily new cases and daily cumulative number of infected cases. The model makes use of the most recent \u0022moving window\u0022 of information relative to suspect cases and dynamically updates the parameters. The proposed method will be useful for the real-time evaluation of a disease outbreak when case classification requires a time-consuming laboratory process to identify a confirmed case.","publish_time":"2010-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chuang, Pei-Hung; Chuang, Jen-Hsiang; Lin, I-Feng","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5133d66a71eb5add9881ec5f254fc0757a7ee06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2894833.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20504379/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["daily new cases","number of confirmed cases","daily number of new cases","unconfirmed cases","positive cases","negative cases","number of suspect cases","daily cumulative number of infected cases","observed confirmed cases","proposed method","date of laboratory confirmation","date of disease onset","case classification","real case","confirmation time","cumulative epidemic curves","disease outbreak","time-consuming laboratory process","given date","gamma distribution","nonparametric distribution","infectious disease surveillance","real-time evaluation","information relative","time lag","conditional probability","accurate real-time estimation","dynamic statistical model","lower absolute relative bias","values","window","duration","historic dengue fever data","study","BACKGROUND","use","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","parameters"],"language":"en"},

The morphology of the microfiber mat was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The thermal and mechanical properties, water contact angle, surface area and pore size of the microfiber mats were characterized. Due to the introduction of graphene which can interact with silk fibroin, the SF/PLGA/GO microfiber mat, compared with the silk fibroin/poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (SF/PLGA) microfiber mat, has higher strength, greater Young\u0027s modulus and better thermal stability which can meet the requirements of protective fabric. The microfiber mat is biodegradable because its main component is silk fibroin and PLGA. In particular, the microfiber mat has a small pore size range of 4 \u223C 10 nm in diameter, a larger surface area of 2.63 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 7.09 \u00D7 10(-3) cm(3) g(-1). The small pore size of the mat can effectively block the particulate pollutants and pathogenic particles in the air. The larger surface area and pore volume of the mat are effective for breathability. Therefore, the fabricated SF/PLGA/GO microfiber mat has great application potentials for protective fabrics.","publish_time":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zulan; Shang, Songmin; Chiu, Ka-lok; Jiang, Shouxiang; Dai, Fangyin","journal":"Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7fa104d1259d9cc1801864a819513f26469bd7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125840.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928493119331364; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928493119331364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31761229/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2019.110308","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Scanning Electron Microscope","SF/PLGA","PLGA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PLGA","microfiber mats","pore volume","biodegradable silk fibroin","fabricated SF","small pore size range","larger surface area","protective fabrics","poly","lactic-co-glycolic acid","requirements of protective fabric","graphene oxide","introduction of graphene","better thermal stability","water contact angle","greater Young\u0027s modulus","higher strength","main component","great application potentials","mechanical properties","nm","electrospinning","Scanning Electron Microscope","particulate pollutants","pathogenic particles","diameter","air","SEM","use","study","breathability","morphology"],"language":"en"},

There are three types of cell-based reporter systems that express certain reporter protein for positive-sense single strand RNA virus infections. The first type is classical reporter system, which relies on recombinant virus, reporter virus particle, or subgenomic replicon. During infection with the recombinant virus or reporter virus particle, the reporter protein is expressed and can be detected in real time in a dose-dependent manner. Using subgenomic replicon, which are genetically engineered viral RNA molecules that are capable of replication but incapable of producing virions, the translation and replication of the replicon could be tracked by the accumulation of reporter protein. The second type of reporter system involves genetically engineered cells bearing virus-specific protease cleavage sequences, which can sense the incoming viral protease. The third type is based on viral replicase, which can report the specific virus infection via detection of the incoming viral replicase. This review specifically focuses on the major technical breakthroughs in the design of cell-based reporter systems and the application of these systems to the further understanding and control of viruses over the past few decades.","publish_time":"2016-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Linzhu; Peng, Zhiyuan; Chen, Xinrong; Ouyang, Hongsheng","journal":"Appl Biochem Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15c3e1dc328a24a254c79d897ca607284eeaed52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091396.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26728654/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1968-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reporter virus particle","Cell-based reporter systems","virus detection","recombinant virus","type of reporter system","certain reporter protein","accumulation of reporter protein","classical reporter system","specific virus infection","studies of viral replication","incoming viral protease","incoming viral replicase","virus-specific protease cleavage sequences","engineered viral RNA molecules","subgenomic replicon","positive-sense single strand RNA virus infections","capable of replication","design of cell","types of cell","engineered cells","pathogenesis","major technical breakthroughs","drug susceptibility testing","control of viruses","translation","virions","dose-dependent manner","application","real time","past","understanding","decades","review"],"language":"en"},

A noncanonical, four-stranded structure formed in guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences, G-quadruplexes can readily form under physiologically relevant conditions and are globularly folded structures. DNA is widely recognized as a double-helical structure essential in genetic information storage. However, only ~3% of the human genome is expressed in protein; RNA and DNA may form noncanonical secondary structures that are functionally important. G-quadruplexes are one such example which have gained considerable attention for their formation and regulatory roles in biologically significant regions, such as human telomeres, oncogene-promoter regions, replication initiation sites, and 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA. They are shown to be a regulatory motif in a number of critical cellular processes including gene transcription, translation, replication, and genomic stability. G-quadruplexes are also found in nonhuman genomes, particularly those of human pathogens. Therefore, G-quadruplexes have emerged as a new class of molecular targets for drug development. In addition, there is considerable interest in the use of G-quadruplexes for biomaterials, biosensors, and biocatalysts. The First International Meeting on Quadruplex DNA was held in 2007, and the G-quadruplex field has been growing dramatically over the last decade. The methods used to study G-quadruplexes have been essential to the rapid progress in our understanding of this exciting nucleic acid secondary structure.","publish_time":"2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Danzhou","journal":"G-Quadruplex Nucleic Acids","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff1be979fed9e2b6048aed72fe3e5919e0306444.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444741/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9666-7_1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G-quadruplexes","use of G","G-quadruplex field","Quadruplex DNA","noncanonical secondary structures","exciting nucleic acid secondary structures","stranded structure","guanine-rich DNA","human telomeres","folded structures","human pathogens","double-helical structure essential","significant regions","RNA sequences","regulatory roles","regulatory motif","considerable attention","oncogene-promoter regions","replication initiation sites","translation","number of critical cellular processes","gene transcription","understanding","genetic information storage","new class of molecular targets","biomaterials","drug development","rapid progress","protein","biosensors","example","relevant conditions","nonhuman genomes","untranslated region","UTR","mRNA","genomic stability","International Meeting","biocatalysts","G4s","methods","addition","decade"],"language":"en"},

We explored whether ICU data reflect influenza like illness (ILI) activity in the general population, and whether ICU respiratory infections can predict influenza epidemics. METHODS: We calculated the time lag and correlation between ILI incidence (from ILI sentinel surveillance, based on general practitioners (GP) consultations) and percentages of ICU admissions with a respiratory infection (from the Dutch National Intensive Care Registry) over the years 2003\u20132011. In addition, ICU data of the first three years was used to build three regression models to predict the start and end of influenza epidemics in the years thereafter, one to three weeks ahead. The predicted start and end of influenza epidemics were compared with observed start and end of such epidemics according to the incidence of ILI. RESULTS: Peaks in respiratory ICU admissions lasted longer than peaks in ILI incidence rates. Increases in ICU admissions occurred on average two days earlier compared to ILI. Predicting influenza epidemics one, two, or three weeks ahead yielded positive predictive values ranging from 0.52 to 0.78, and sensitivities from 0.34 to 0.51. CONCLUSIONS: ICU data was associated with ILI activity, with increases in ICU data often occurring earlier and for a longer time period.

Following infection, IFNs induce a group of OAS genes whose products are activated by viral double-stranded RNA. OAS uses ATP to generate 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A). 2-5A binds to and activates the ubiquitous cellular endoribonuclease RNase L causing cleavages of single stranded regions of both viral and cellular RNA thus inhibiting viral replication. In addition, detection of the newly generated short RNAs by cellular pattern recognition receptors, MDA5 and RIG-I, further enhances IFN production and the ensuing antiviral activities. The intracellular concentration of 2-5A is believed to be the primary factor controlling RNase L activation. The liver contains abundant innate immune cells, which provide the first line of defense against pathogens. However, the factors that determine whether a virus can bypass this defense to access and infect the liver parenchyma are not well understood. The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain A59, infection of mice provides a model for virus induced hepatitis. The MHV accessory protein, ns2, antagonizes the type I IFN response in macrophages and promotes the induction of hepatitis. Here we will describe how the ns2 protein facilitates the development of viral hepatitis by blocking OAS-RNase L pathway. Methods Bone marrow macrophages (BMM) from wild type (wt) and RNase L\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with A59 and ns2 mutant MHV. Viral titers were determined by plaque assays. RNase L activity was monitored by rRNA integrity in RNA chips. Intracellular levels of 2-5A were measured using RNase L activation assays. Effects of ns2 on 2-5A levels in cells were determined by transfecting ns2 or mutant ns2 cDNAs into HEK-293T cells. Recombinant ns2 and mutant ns2H126R proteins were purified and incubated with 2-5A in vitro and the 2-5A breakdown products were measured by HPLC. Hepatitis was determined by histology following inoculation A59 or ns2 mutant MHV into wt and RNase L\u2212/\u2212 mice. Results We found evidence for a new molecular mechanism of subversion of the RNase L pathway in macrophages that regulates acute hepatitis during MHV infection. Coronavirus ns2 belongs to the LigT-like protein family, within the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily, some of which possess cyclophosphodiesterase activity (CPD). We have found that ns2 is not a CPD, but instead is a 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves, and thus eliminates 2-5A, the activator of RNase L. We observed that ns2 blocks the IFN inducible OAS-RNase L pathway to facilitate hepatitis development. Ns2 prevents activation of RNase L and consequently limits viral RNA degradation. An ns2 mutant virus was unable to replicate in the liver or induce hepatitis in wt mice, but was highly pathogenic in RNase L\u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, RNase L is a critical cellular factor for protection against viral infection of the liver and the resulting hepatitis.

However, select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding interleukin-6 (IL-6), escape SOX-induced cleavage. IL-6 escape is mediated through a 3\u2019 UTR RNA regulatory element that overrides the SOX targeting mechanism. Here, we reveal that this protective RNA element functions to broadly restrict cleavage by a range of homologous and non-homologous viral endonucleases. However, it does not impede cleavage by cellular endonucleases. The IL-6 protective sequence may be representative of a larger class of nuclease escape elements, as we identified a similar protective element in the GADD45B mRNA. The IL-6 and GADD45B-derived elements display similarities in their sequence, putative structure, and several associated RNA binding proteins. However, the overall composition of their ribonucleoprotein complexes appears distinct, leading to differences in the breadth of nucleases restricted. These findings highlight how RNA elements can selectively control transcript abundance in the background of widespread virus-induced mRNA degradation. The ability of viruses to control the host gene expression environment is crucial to promote viral infection. Many viruses express factors that reduce host gene expression through widespread mRNA decay. However, some mRNAs escape this fate, like the transcript encoding the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-6 during KSHV infection. IL-6 escape relies on an RNA regulatory element located in its 3\u2019UTR and involves the recruitment of a protective protein complex. Here, we show that this escape extends beyond KSHV to a variety of related and unrelated viral endonucleases. However, the IL-6 element does not protect against cellular endonucleases, revealing for the first time a virus-specific nuclease escape element. We identified a related escape element in the GADD45B mRNA, which displays several similarities with the IL-6 element. However, these elements assemble a largely distinct complex of proteins, leading to differences in the breadth of their protective capacity. Collectively, these findings reveal how a putative new class of RNA elements function to control RNA fate in the background of widespread mRNA degradation by viral endonucleases.","publish_time":"2017-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muller, Mandy; Glaunsinger, Britt A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a51b191fd6575831585eee67a0ac67f209d8fcb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/155457","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SOX","KSHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["related escape element","protective RNA element functions","RNA fate","UTR RNA regulatory element","similar protective element","GADD45B mRNA","virus-specific nuclease escape element","viral infection","background of widespread mRNA degradation","widespread mRNA decay","unrelated viral endonucleases","larger class of nuclease escape elements","protective sequence","widespread degradation of cytoplasmic messenger RNA","cellular endonucleases","immunoregulatory cytokine IL","associated RNA binding proteins","non-homologous viral endonucleases","background of widespread virus-induced mRNA degradation","putative new class of RNA elements function","GADD45B-derived elements","KSHV infection","protective capacity","SOX-induced cleavage","protective protein complex","viral endonu-clease SOX","similarities","transcript abundance","differences","distinct complex of proteins","findings","mRNAs","host gene expression environment","putative structure","range of homologous","variety of related","ability of viruses","breadth of nucleases","viruses express factors","lytic Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","time","ribonucleoprotein complexes","recruitment","overall composition","interleukin","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

However, the molecular mechanism of the regulation of chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) expression has yet to be fully elucidated. With this in mind, a \u223C2.5 kb chMDA5 gene promoter region was examined and PCR amplified to assess its role in immune response. A chMDA5 promoter reporter plasmid (piggybac-MDA5-DsRed) was constructed and transfected into DF-1 cells to establish a Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cell line. The MDA5 promoter activity was extremely low under basal condition, but was dramatically increased when cells were stimulated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), interferon beta (IFN-\u03B2) or Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV). The DsRed mRNA level represented the promoter activity and was remarkably increased, which matched the expression of endogenous MDA5. However, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to increase the MDA5 promoter activity and the expression of endogenous MDA5. The results indicated that the promoter and the Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cell line could be utilized to determine whether a ligand regulates MDA5 expression.

However, it has rarely been epidemic outside the area except one large outbreak in South Korea in May 2015. The genome of the epidemic MERS-CoV isolated from a Korean patient revealed its homology to previously reported strains. MERS-CoV encodes 5 accessory proteins and generally, they do not participate in the genome transcription and replication but rather are involved in viral evasion of the host innate immune responses. Here we report that ORF8b, an accessory protein of MERS-CoV, strongly inhibits both MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated activation of interferon beta promoter activity while downstream signaling molecules were left largely unaffected. Of note, MDA5 protein levels were significantly down-regulated by ORF8b and co-expression of ORF4a and ORF4b.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is related to the pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translation regulation in the cytoplasm. In this report, based on the relevant biophysical and biochemical assays, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS_CoV (SARS_N) was discovered to exhibit high binding affinity to human hnRNP A1. GST pull-down results clearly demonstrated that SARS_N protein could directly and specifically bind to human hnRNP A1 in vitro. Yeast two-hybrid assays further indicated in vivo that such binding relates to the fragment (aa 161\u2013210) of SARS_N and the Gly-rich domain (aa 203\u2013320) of hnRNP A1. Moreover, kinetic analyses by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology revealed that SARS_N protein has a specific binding affinity against human hnRNP A1 with K(D) at 0.35 \u00B1 0.02 \u03BCM (k(on) = 5.83 \u00B1 0.42 \u00D7 10(3) M(\u22121) s(\u22121) and k(off) = 2.06 \u00B1 0.12 \u00D7 10(\u22123) s(\u22121)). It is suggested that both SARS_N and hnRNP A1 proteins are possibly within the SARS_CoV replication/transcription complex and SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction might function in the regulation of SARS_CoV RNA synthesis. In addition, the determined results showed that SARS_N protein has only one binding domain for interacting with human hnRNP A1, which is different from the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) binding case where the nucleocapsid protein of MHV (MHV_N) was found to have two binding domains involved in the MHV_N/hnRNP A1 interaction, thereby suggesting that SARS_N protein might carry out a different binding mode to bind to human hnRNP A1 for its further function performance in comparison with MHV_N.","publish_time":"2005-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Haibin; Chen, Qing; Chen, Jing; Chen, Kaixian; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hualiang","journal":"FEBS Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/325b2c30b4ea2744c6afe98696b53ee2ca2faea4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4c7a75b5ee08440c390b0ba779c986bd21ac2f42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094256.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579305004321; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579305004321","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","GST","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N protein","nucleocapsid protein of SARS","regulation of SARS","protein of SARS coronavirus","hnRNP A1 proteins","human hnRNP A1 interaction","nucleocapsid protein of MHV","multifunctional protein","binding case","binding domains","Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1","specific binding affinity","high binding affinity","different binding mode","CoV replication","CoV RNA synthesis","translation regulation","viral RNA replication","biochemical assays","determined results","hybrid assays","function performance","Gly-rich domain","GST pull-down results","technology","surface plasmon resonance","transcription complex","SPR","mouse hepatitis virus","nucleus","kinetic analyses","major structural component of virions","cytoplasm","pre-mRNA","comparison","report","Yeast","addition","fragment","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

Methods A retrospective cohort study in Korean military hospitals was conducted between January 2012 and December 2018. Patients with potentially severe HAdV pneumonia with risk factors for respiratory failure were included and divided into early (within 7 days from symptom onset) and delayed (after 7 days from symptom onset) treatment groups. The primary outcome was respiratory failure development within 21 days after symptom onset. Results A total of 89 patients with potentially severe HAdV pneumonia were enrolled in the cohort; they included 62 early and 27 delayed treatment patients. All patients were males in their early 20s. Significantly fewer patients in the early treatment group progressed to respiratory failure (8/62, 12.9%), compared to the delayed group (18/27, 66.7%, p \u003C 0.001).

Though viral respiratory tract infections are reported triggers for exacerbations, information on these infections with asthma is sparse in Caribbean territories. We examined the distribution of respiratory viruses and their association with seasons in acute and stable asthmatic children in Trinidad. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 70 wheezing children attending the emergency department for nebulisation and 80 stable control subjects (2 to 16 yr of age) in the asthma clinic, nasal specimens were collected during the dry (n = 38, January to May) and rainy (n = 112, June to December) seasons. A multitarget, sensitive, specific high-throughput Respiratory MultiCode assay tested for respiratory-virus sequences for eight distinct groups: human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and enterovirus. RESULTS: Wheezing children had a higher [\u03C7(2 )= 5.561, p = 0.018] prevalence of respiratory viruses compared with stabilized asthmatics (34.3% (24) versus (vs.) 17.5% (14)). Acute asthmatics were thrice as likely to be infected with a respiratory virus (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.2 \u2013 5.3). The predominant pathogens detected in acute versus stable asthmatics were the rhinovirus (RV) (n = 18, 25.7% vs. n = 7, 8.8%; p = 0.005), respiratory syncytial virus B (RSV B) (n = 2, 2.9% vs. n = 4, 5.0%), and enterovirus (n = 1, 1.4% vs. n = 2, 2.5%). Strong odds for rhinoviral infection were observed among nebulised children compared with stable asthmatics (p = 0.005, OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.4 \u2013 9.3,). RV was prevalent throughout the year (Dry, n = 6, 15.8%; Rainy, n = 19, 17.0%) and without seasonal association [\u03C7(2 )= 0.028, p = 0.867]. However it was the most frequently detected virus [Dry = 6/10, (60.0%); Rainy = 19/28, (67.9%)] in both seasons. CONCLUSION: Emergent wheezing illnesses during childhood can be linked to infection with rhinovirus in Trinidad\u0027s tropical environment. Viral-induced exacerbations of asthma are independent of seasons in this tropical climate. Further clinical and virology investigations are recommended on the role of infections with the rhinovirus in Caribbean childhood wheeze.","publish_time":"2009-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matthew, Jason; Pinto Pereira, Lexley M; Pappas, Tressa E; Swenson, Cheri A; Grindle, Kris A; Roberg, Kathy A; Lemanske, Robert F; Lee, Wai-Ming; Gern, James E","journal":"Ital J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25f4a5990fcb174f80bc472629eb47be50d5b3f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2717562.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19555507/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1824-7288-35-16","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Caribbean","Trinidad"],"keyphrases":["respiratory-virus sequences","respiratory syncytial virus B","detected virus","parainfluenza virus","prevalence of respiratory viruses","stable asthmatics","distribution of respiratory viruses","viral respiratory tract infections","wheezing children","Childhood asthma","Acute asthmatics","stable asthmatic children","human rhinovirus","nebulised children","asthma clinic","independent of seasons","stabilized asthmatics","Caribbean childhood wheeze","Viral-induced exacerbations of asthma","specific high-throughput Respiratory MultiCode assay","stable control subjects","role of infections","Caribbean territories","RV","enterovirus","Emergent wheezing illnesses","RSV B","rhinoviral infection","tropical climate","seasonal association","Trinidad\u0027s tropical environment","distinct groups","nebulisation","metapneumovirus","triggers","emergency department","adenovirus","CONCLUSION","cross-sectional study","nasal specimens","coronavirus","information","year","yr of age","predominant pathogens","virology investigations","multitarget","Strong odds","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","morbidity"],"language":"en"},

Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirus-induced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three G-tetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs.","publish_time":"2018-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zahin, Maryam; Dean, William L.; Ghim, Shin-je; Joh, Joongho; Gray, Robert D.; Khanal, Sujita; Bossart, Gregory D.; Mignucci-Giannoni, Antonio A.; Rouchka, Eric C.; Jenson, Alfred B.; Trent, John O.; Chaires, Jonathan B.; Chariker, Julia H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5891072.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29630682/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0195625","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Florida","United States"],"keyphrases":["formation of G4","enrichment of G4 sequences","TmPVs","E2 region","DNA sequences","G-tetrad structures","G-quadruplex structures","formation of non-canonical structures","genital lesions","E4 region","G-tetrads","L2 region","vast majority of sequences","induced lesions","cutaneous lesions","viral genomes","non-coding regions","similar regional locations","viral papillomatosis","human PVs","reverse strand","Florida manatees","viral control","DNA strands","putative E2 binding sites","multiple targets","Computational analysis","manatee papillomaviruses","biophysical analysis","threatened aquatic mammal","Trichechus manatus latirotris","appearance of papillomavirus","United States coastal waters","potential","possible regulatory elements","research","TmPV1","parallel topology","management","past decade","concern","contrast","findings","TmPV3","TmPV4","date","rehabilitation","species","cases","structural stability"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The seroprevalence study was done from the random sampling (n=1000) of blood collected from 29 dual-purpose herds, located in three municipalities (Aguachica, Rio de Oro, and La Gloria) of Cesar department. The presence of antibodies against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI-3V) in the samples was detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Epidemiological data were obtained using a questionnaire administered to the owner or manager of each herd. RESULTS: The overall highest seroprevalence was observed for BHV-1 (94.7%), followed by BRSV (98.6%), BVDV (35.2%), and BPI-3V (47.1%). Regarding the seroprevalence by municipalities, there was a statistical association (p\u003C0.05) for BVDV; however, for BRSV, BHV-1, and BPI-3V, no statistical association was found (p\u003E0.05) between seropositive values and the municipalities, indicating that animal was seropositive in similar proportions in the three municipalities. Female sex and older animals (\u003E24 months) were a significant risk factor for BHV-1 and BPI-3V infection. Regarding the clinical signs, there was a statistical association (p\u003C0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV and most of clinical signs observed, except for abortion. CONCLUSION: This research confirms the high seroprevalence of the respiratory viral pathogens in nonvaccinated cattle within the study areas. Therefore, appropriate sanitary management practices and routine vaccination programs should be adopted to reduce the seroprevalence of these infectious agents.","publish_time":"2019-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Le\u00F3n, Juan Carlos Pinilla; Diaz, Wilson; Vasquez, Mar\u00EDa Cristina; Tob\u00F3n, Julio Cesar; S\u00E1nchez, Alfredo; Ortiz, Diego","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0ec066b46e51073a3ccfbc05fe626d0c93f8b29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6702553.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2019.951-958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528017/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rio de Oro","BRSV","BVDV"],"locations":["Colombia"],"keyphrases":["seroprevalence study","BHV","BPI","Gloria municipalities","high seroprevalence","BRSV","statistical association","seropositive values of BVDV","bovine viral diarrhea virus","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory viral pathogens","overall highest seroprevalence","bovine parainfluenza","bovine herpesvirus type","dual-purpose cattle of Aguachica","Oro","Rio","Cesar department","clinical signs","research","significant risk factor","nonvaccinated cattle","study areas","dual-purpose herds","appropriate sanitary management practices","routine vaccination programs","months","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","questionnaire","older animals","presence of antibodies","similar proportions","Colombia","random sampling","owner","manager","Female sex","blood","samples","RESULTS","MATERIALS","METHODS","Epidemiological data","CONCLUSION","abortion","infectious agents","AIM","infection"],"language":"en"},

Of the several SARS CoV structural proteins, the nucleocapsid protein has been shown to be a good diagnostic marker. In this study, an ssDNA aptamer that specifically binds to SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein was isolated from a DNA library containing 45-nuceotide random sequences in the middle of an 88mer single-stranded DNA. After twelve cycles of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure, 15 ssDNA aptamers were identified. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis was then used to identify the aptamer with the highest binding affinity to the SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein. Using this approach, an ssDNA aptamer that binds to the nucleocapsid protein with a K d of 4.93\u00B10.30nM was identified. Western blot analysis further demonstrated that this ssDNA aptamer could be used to efficiently detect the SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein when compared with a nucleocapsid antibody.

Singular PCV2 infection rarely results in clinical disease; however, PCVAD is often accelerated in onset, enhanced in severity and prolonged in duration by concurrent viral or bacterial infections. Due to its effect on the immune system, PCV2 has also been shown to enhance protozoal, metazoal, and fungal infections. Several retrospective or cross-sectional studies have investigated the presence and prevalence of various infectious agents associated with PCVAD under field conditions. Experimental models confirm that PCV2 replication and associated lesions can be enhanced by concurrent infection with other viruses or bacteria. The exact mechanisms by which concurrent pathogens upregulate PCV2 are unknown. Co-infections may promote PCV2 infection by increasing immune host cell replication and accumulation in tissues thereby enhancing targets for PCV2 replication. It has also been proposed that co-infections interfere with PCV2 clearance by alteration of cytokine production and profiles. The outcome of differences in timing of co-infections in PCV2-infected pigs is also likely very important and is an area where more research is needed. Given the current knowledge base, it is important that veterinarians do a thorough diagnostic investigation on herds where PCVAD is a recurrent problem in order to implement the most appropriate and cost effective intervention strategies.","publish_time":"2012-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Opriessnig, Tanja; Halbur, Patrick G.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c64459702f78aac9778ccc9c0d63a9bf6d1f26e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114432.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.09.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211003510; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211003510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21959087/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","North America"],"keyphrases":["PCV2 replication","PCV2 clearance","Singular PCV2 infection","PCVAD","PCV2-infected pigs","concurrent infection","timing of co-infections","bacterial infections","fungal infections","clinical disease","disease syndrome","essential component of porcine circovirus disease","concurrent pathogens","Abstract Porcine circovirus type","associated lesions","immune host cell replication","immune system","tissues","presence","herds","accumulation","duration","prevalence of various infectious agents","PCVD","thorough diagnostic investigation","alteration of cytokine production","veterinarians","Europe","severity","order","recurrent problem","targets","cross-sectional studies","field conditions","outcome of differences","exact mechanisms","current knowledge base","Experimental models","effective intervention strategies","profiles","area","onset","metazoal","viruses","North America","research"],"language":"en"},

There was no significant change in the tumor type or reason for referral. Short fractionation schedules were employed for 35% of treated patients compared with 34% in 2002. Patient waiting times between referral and treatment decreased during the period of interest, from 16 days to 8 days (P = 0.021). This study demonstrates a reduction in palliative RT services that is similar in magnitude to decreases observed in other essential cancer services during the SARS epidemic. Use of single-fraction RT and delayed follow-up visits may help to minimize hospital transfers and visits in the event of future infectious disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2005-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Justin; Holden, Lori; Fung, Kinwah; Danjoux, Cyril; Chow, Edward; Gillies, Carol","journal":"Supportive Cancer Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9c9540862cb3533272f1a352de1bd7b962b9395.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1543291213600454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18628197/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1543291213600454; https://doi.org/10.3816/sct.2005.n.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic","number of patients","palliative RT services","treated patients","single-fraction RT","reduction","referral","days","study","times","number of patient consultations","peak period of incidence","single institution","Treatment characteristics","delayed follow-up visits","essential cancer services","utilization of palliative radiation therapy","access","severe acute respiratory syndrome","event of future infectious disease outbreaks","tumor type","impact","hospital transfers","reason","retrospective chart review","magnitude","significant change","Short fractionation schedules","total"],"language":"en"},

However, the mechanisms by which environmental factors, such as infection, contribute to the pathogenesis and/or symptom exacerbation remain to be fully elucidated. Relapse frequency in MS patients contributes to neurological impairment and, in the initial phases of disease, serves as a predictor of poor disease prognosis. The purpose of this review is to examine the evidence that supports a role for peripheral infection in modulating the natural history of this disease. Evidence supporting a role for infection in promoting exacerbation in animal models of MS is also reviewed. Finally, a few mechanisms by which infection may exacerbate symptoms of MS and other neurological diseases are discussed. Those who comprise the majority of MS patients acquire approximately two upper-respiratory infections per year; furthermore, this type of infection doubles the risk for MS relapse, underscoring the contribution of this relationship as being potentially important and particularly detrimental.","publish_time":"2015-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steelman, Andrew J.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d44571bd848bc813e4cdd2fe8c36b922433ec4da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4609887.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26539193/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00520","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MS relapse","symptoms of MS","peripheral infection","type of infection","majority of MS patients","animal models of MS","disease intervention","initial phases of disease","role","evidence","mechanisms","predictor of poor disease prognosis","neurological impairment","symptom exacerbation","neurological diseases","Relapse frequency","environmental factors","pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis","effective therapeutic strategies","year","upper-respiratory infections","natural history","risk","significant advances","past","decades","approval","contribution","relationship","review","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Since children are less than 1% of reported cases, there is limited information to develop evidence-based practice recommendations. The objective of this study was to rapidly gather expert knowledge and experience to guide the care of children with chronic kidney disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A four-round multi-center Delphi exercise was conducted among 13 centers in 11 European countries of the European Pediatric Dialysis Working Group (EPDWG) between March, 16th and 20th 2020. Results were analyzed using a mixed methods qualitative approach and descriptive statistics. RESULTS Thirteen COVID-19 specific topics of particular need for guidance were identified. Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3). Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines. CONCLUSIONS As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available. This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists\u0027 response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis.

To investigate the clinical relevance of RSV-A ON1,acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases enrolled to our population-based prospective pediatric ARI surveillance at Khanh Hoa General Hospital, Central Vietnam from January 2010 through December 2012 were studied. Clinical-epidemiological information and nasopharyngeal samples were collected. Multiplex PCR assays were performed for screening 13 respiratory viruses. RSV-positive samples were further tested for subgroups (A/B) and genotypes information by sequencing the G-glycoprotein 2nd hypervariable region. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of RSV-A ON1. A total of 1854 ARI cases were enrolled and 426 (23.0%) of them were RSV-positive. During the study period, RSV-A and B had been co-circulating. NA1 was the predominant RSV-A genotype until the appearance of ON1 in 2012. RSV-related ARI hospitalization incidence significantly increased after the emergence of ON1. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that risk of lower respiratory tract infection was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.37\u20133.72) times, and radiologically-confirmed pneumonia was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.01\u20133.87) times greater in ON1 compared to NA1 cases.

In vitro, sarcoid derived fibroblasts are invasive and express matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -1, -2 and -9. It was hypothesised that the MMPs produced by neoplastic cells play a role in both their local invasiveness and interaction with the overlying epidermis (picket fence formation). The objective of this morphological study was to investigate the local behaviour and in situ MMP expression pattern in sarcoids of different clinical types. A total of 43 surgically excised sarcoids were examined by histology, immunohistology for the expression of MMP-1, -2 and -9, and transmission electron microscopy. Regardless of the clinical type, sarcoids showed local invasion of the dermis and damage to the basement membrane in areas of interaction with the epidermis. This was associated with MMP-1 expression in both neoplastic cells and epidermis.

Confluent lesions covering the whole inoculated area were produced by 107 viable units of the fungus, whereas the minimal infective dose of 103 viable units produced limited areas of infection only. The level of nutrition within the limits imposed had no effect on the extent or severity of lesions. The fungus was found to invade the keratinized portions of skin and hair of cattle of all ages at the same rate. However, both the cutaneous inflammatory response and the resolution of lesions were most rapid in older animals. The ability to eliminate infection more rapidly was associated with a marked delayed hypersensitivity response commencing 14 days after infection. Such hypersensitivity was not detectable by this means after the resolution of lesions. T. verrueosum could not be isolated in culture from skin lesions until 21 days after inoculation and could only be isolated for half the period that lesions were present. Cattle were resistant to cutaneous reinfection with viable T. verrueosum on previously infected or fresh skin sites at 2 months and at more than one year after the resolution of primary lesions.

We hypothesize that dysbiosis between regular residents of the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome, that is balance between commensals and potential pathogens, is involved in pathogen overgrowth and consequently disease. We compared oropharyngeal microbiota of elderly pneumonia patients (n=100) with healthy elderly (n=91) by 16S-rRNA-based sequencing and verified our findings in young adult pneumonia patients (n=27) and young healthy adults (n=187). Microbiota profiles differed significantly between elderly pneumonia patients and healthy elderly (PERMANOVA, P\u003C0.0005). Highly similar differences were observed between microbiota profiles of young adult pneumonia patients and their healthy controls. Clustering resulted in 11 (sub)clusters including 95% (386/405) of samples. We observed three microbiota profiles strongly associated with pneumonia (P\u003C0.05) and either dominated by lactobacilli (n=11), Rothia (n=51) or Streptococcus (pseudo)pneumoniae (n=42). In contrast, three other microbiota clusters (in total n=183) were correlated with health (P\u003C0.05) and were all characterized by more diverse profiles containing higher abundances of especially Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella and Leptotrichia. For the remaining clusters (n=99), the association with health or disease was less clear. A decision tree model based on the relative abundance of five bacterial community members in URT microbiota showed high specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 84% (89% and 73%, respectively, after cross-validation) for differentiating pneumonia patients from healthy individuals. These results suggest that pneumonia in elderly and young adults is associated with dysbiosis of the URT microbiome with bacterial overgrowth of single species and absence of distinct anaerobic bacteria. Whether the observed microbiome changes are a cause or a consequence of the development of pneumonia or merely coincide with disease status remains a question for future research.","publish_time":"2015-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Steenhuijsen Piters, Wouter A A; Huijskens, Elisabeth G W; Wyllie, Anne L; Biesbroek, Giske; van den Bergh, Menno R; Veenhoven, Reinier H; Wang, Xinhui; Trzci\u0144ski, Krzysztof; Bonten, Marc J; Rossen, John W A; Sanders, Elisabeth A M; Bogaert, Debby","journal":"The ISME Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4c42ddd0d0d9ce2037d2cd40f991afff3408b95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4681870.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2015.99; https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201599.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151645/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bacterial pneumonia","healthy elderly","oropharyngeal microbiota of elderly pneumonia patients","differentiating pneumonia patients","microbiota profiles of young adult pneumonia patients","development of pneumonia","total n","URT microbiota","microbiota clusters","young healthy adults","URT microbiome","young adults","healthy individuals","healthy controls","diverse profiles","observed microbiome changes","dysbiosis","disease status","remaining clusters","bacterial overgrowth of single species","bacterial community members","pathogen overgrowth","based sequencing","major cause of morbidity","relative abundance","upper respiratory tract","findings","Prevotella melaninogenica","higher abundances","high specificity","absence of distinct anaerobic bacteria","regular residents","PERMANOVA","Veillonella","question","mortality","consequence","Streptococcus","decision tree model","potential pathogens","future research","S-rRNA","cross-validation","Leptotrichia","commensals","pseudo","pneumoniae","similar differences","association","sensitivity","sub","contrast","results","Rothia","Clustering","lactobacilli","samples"],"language":"en"},

Methods Fifteen left single-lung transplantations were done in weight-mismatched canine pairs. The animals were divided into 3 groups: group 1, in which transplantation was done without cardiopulmonary bypass; group 2, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and in which the cardiopulmonary bypass flow was decreased slowly with controlled pulmonary artery pressure; and group 3, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration. Hemodynamic parameters and lung function were monitored for 6 hours after reperfusion. The grafts were harvested for histologic studies, myeloperoxidase assay, and real-time quantitive reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction of mRNA encoding interleukin 6. Results The hemodynamic parameters were similar among the 3 groups. In group 1 Pao 2 and alveolar to arterial gradient for O2 levels were excellent throughout the 6-hour observation period, but in group 2 they progressively deteriorated. However, ultrafiltration significantly (P = .02) improved the Pao 2 level in group 3. On histology, interstitial edema and polynuclear cell infiltration were most marked in group 2 and significantly worse than in groups 1 and 3. Myeloperoxidase assay and real-time quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction showed increased myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression in group 2 grafts compared with group 1 grafts. Myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression were suppressed with ultrafiltration. Conclusions Cardiopulmonary bypass had negative effects on the graft, but ultrafiltration attenuated acute lung dysfunction by reducing the inflammatory response.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saitoh, Masayuki; Tsuchida, Masanori; Koike, Terumoto; Satoh, Koichi; Haga, Manabu; Aoki, Tadashi; Toyabe, Shin-ichi; Hayashi, Jun-ichi","journal":"The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a09678dcc66bd682efd73b5587e18189dc8e946.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127439.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022522306014383; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022522306014383","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pao"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ultrafiltration","effects of cardiopulmonary bypass","cardiopulmonary bypass flow","Conclusions Cardiopulmonary bypass","myeloperoxidase assay","lung function","interleukin","grafts","groups","canine single-lung transplantation model","increased myeloperoxidase activity","graft function","gene expression","left single-lung transplantations","acute lung dysfunction","Pao","Hemodynamic parameters","real-time quantitive reverse transcription","real-time quantitative reverse transcription","polymerase chain reaction of mRNA","negative effects","weight-mismatched canine pairs","polynuclear cell infiltration","arterial gradient","interstitial edema","O2 levels","controlled pulmonary artery pressure","histologic studies","histology","Methods","hour observation period","inflammatory response","study","hours","Objective","purpose","reperfusion","animals"],"language":"en"},

As of March 31, 2020, a total of 82,631 cases of COVID-19 in China were confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China. METHODS: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. RESULTS: A total of 198 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 139 dates of infections were identified among 14,829 confirmed cases outside Hubei Province as reported as of March 31, 2020. Based on this information, we found that the serial interval had an average of 4.60 days with a standard deviation of 5.55 days, the incubation period had an average of 8.00 days with a standard deviation of 4.75 days and the infectious period had an average of 13.96 days with a standard deviation of 5.20 days. The estimated controlled reproduction numbers, [Formula: see text] , produced by all three methods in all analyzed regions of China are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers [Formula: see text]. CONCLUSIONS: The controlled reproduction number in China is much lower than one in all regions of China by now. It fell below one within 30 days from the implementations of unprecedent containment measures, which indicates that the strong measures taken by China government was effective to contain the epidemic. Nonetheless, efforts are still needed in order to end the current epidemic as imported cases from overseas pose a high risk of a second outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"You, Chong; Deng, Yuhao; Hu, Wenjie; Sun, Jiarui; Lin, Qiushi; Zhou, Feng; Pang, Cheng Heng; Zhang, Yuan; Chen, Zhengchao; Zhou, Xiao-Hua","journal":"Int J Hyg Environ Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5d475f0a67034f1bd432df91907ef606801be48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211652.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463920302133?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463920302133","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["days","China government","analyzed regions of China","basic reproduction numbers","average","standard deviation","estimated controlled reproduction numbers","cases of COVID","confirmed cases","dynamic model-based method","Poisson likelihood-based method","exponential growth rate-based method","Formula","imported cases","outbreak","total","METHODS","text","dates of infections","strong measures","incubation period","infectious period","current epidemic","dates of symptoms onset","implementations of unprecedent containment measures","EGR","stochastic Susceptible-Infected","Wuhan","chains of transmission","National Health Commission","NHC","approaches","SIR","novel coronavirus","high risk","order","world-wide attention","Hubei Province","serial interval","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","efforts","information"],"language":"en"},

Seven expression plasmids differing in the resistance gene, origin of replication, promoter sequence, and fusion protein tag were generated and transformed into four different E. coli expression strains, resulting in 18 strains that were tested for glycosylation efficiency with terpenols and a phenol. E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao yielded the highest titres. The product concentration was improved 8.6-fold compared with E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS/pET29a_VvGT14ao.

However, little is known about their clinical performance. Here, we compared two commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays. METHODS 103 specimens from 48 patients with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 153 control specimens were analyzed using SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays by Abbott and EUROIMMUN (EI). Duration from symptom onset was determined by medical record review. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and concordance were calculated. RESULTS The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had a diagnostic specificity of 99.4% (95% CI; 96.41-99.98%), and sensitivity of 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at \u003C3 days post symptom onset, 30.0% (95% CI; 11.89-54.28) at 3-7d, 47.8% (95% CI; 26.82-69.41) at 8-13d and 93.8% (95% CI; 82.80-98.69) at \u226514d. Diagnostic specificity on the EI assay was 94.8% (95% CI; 89.96-97.72) if borderline results were considered positive and 96.7% (95% CI; 92.54-98.93) if borderline results were considered negative.

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway. The present study was designed to investigate whether there is a multi-gene family in I. Indigotic and, if so, to characterize their properties. We conducted a comprehensive survey on the transcription profiling database by using tBLASTn analysis. Several bioinformatics methods were employed to perform the prediction of composition and physicochemical characters. The expression levels of IiPAL genes in various tissues of I. indigotica with stress treatment were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Protoplast transient transformation was used to observe the locations of IiPALs. IiPALs were functionally characterized by expression with pET-32a vector in Escherichia colis strain BL21 (DE3). Integration of transcripts and metabolite accumulations was used to reveal the relation between IiPALs and target compounds. An new gene (IiPAL2) was identified and both IiPALs had the conserved enzymatic active site Ala-Ser-Gly and were classified as members of dicotyledon. IiPAL1 and IiPAL2 were expressed in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers, with the highest expression levels of IiPAL1 and IiPAL2 being observed in stems and roots, respectively. The two genes responded to the exogenous elicitor in different manners. Subcellular localization experiment showed that both IiPALs were localized in the cytosol. The recombinant proteins were shown to catalyze the conversion of L-Phe to trans-cinnamic acid. Correlation analysis indicated that IiPAL1 was more close to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites than IiPAL2. In conclusion, the present study provides a basis for the elucidation of the role of IiPALs genes in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, which will help further metabolic engineering to improve the accumulation of bioactive components in I. indigotica.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"MA, Rui-Fang; LIU, Qian-Zi; XIAO, Ying; ZHANG, Lei; LI, Qing; YIN, Jun; CHEN, Wan-Sheng","journal":"Chinese Journal of Natural Medicines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1b623a045c20902da9d01d0eb127c9664079ad2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1875536416300978; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875536416300978; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1875-5364(16)30097-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27914524/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Phenylalanine"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Escherichia"],"keyphrases":["IiPAL2","role of IiPALs genes","locations of IiPALs","biosynthesis of phenolic compounds","expression levels of IiPAL genes","highest expression levels of IiPAL1","phenylpropanoid pathway","indigotica","Abstract Phenolic compounds","target compounds","stems","roots","present study","biosynthesis of secondary metabolites","important role","tBLASTn analysis","Correlation analysis","new gene","multi-gene family","various tissues of","conserved enzymatic active site Ala-Ser","transcription profiling database","stress treatment","vector","Escherichia colis strain BL21","Gly","growth","flowers","elucidation","environmental adaptation","DE3","comprehensive survey","accumulation of bioactive components","exogenous elicitor","key enzyme","basis","quantitative real-time PCR","prediction of composition","metabolite accumulations","trans-cinnamic acid","conversion","physicochemical characters","Integration of transcripts","Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase","different manners","plants","metabolic engineering","pET","leaves","Subcellular localization experiment","Protoplast transient transformation","conclusion","recombinant proteins","bioinformatics methods","members of dicotyledon","cytosol","properties"],"language":"en"},

The characterization of these important populations may enable development of new therapeutics to treat acute or chronic lung disease. In this study, we aimed to establish the presence of bronchioloalveolar progenitors in ovine lungs and to characterize their potential to differentiate into specialized cells. RESULTS: Lung cells were studied using immunohistochemistry on frozen sections of the lung. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry were conducted on ex-vivo derived pulmonary cells. The bronchioloalveolar progenitors were identified by their co-expression of CCSP, SP-C and CD34. A minor population of CD34(pos)/SP-C(pos)/CCSP(pos) cells (0.33% \u00B1 0.31) was present ex vivo in cell suspensions from dissociated lungs. Using CD34 magnetic positive-cell sorting, undifferentiated SP-C(pos)/CCSP(pos) cells were purified (\u003E80%) and maintained in culture. Using synthetic media and various extracellular matrices, SP-C(pos)/CCSP(pos) cells differentiated into either club cells (formerly named Clara cells) or alveolar epithelial type-II cells. Furthermore, these ex vivo and in vitro derived bronchioloalveolar progenitors expressed NANOG, OCT4 and BMI1, specifically described in progenitors or stem cells, and during lung development. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time in a large animal the existence of bronchioloalveolar progenitors with dual differentiation potential and the expression of specialized genes. These newly described cell population in sheep could be implicated in regeneration of the lung following lesions or in development of diseases such as cancers.","publish_time":"2013-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Archer, Fabienne; Abi-Rizk, Alain; Desloire, Sophie; Dolmazon, Christine; Gineys, Barbara; Guiguen, Fran\u00E7ois; Cottin, Vincent; Mornex, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Leroux, Caroline","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c52ffa67fea523c74bd0c0f45033183f403692ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3831758.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24206786/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-9-224","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCSP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lung cells","specialized cells","Clara cells","club cells","stem cells","lung development","derived pulmonary cells","derived bronchioloalveolar progenitors","existence of bronchioloalveolar progenitors","presence of bronchioloalveolar progenitors","Airways progenitors","lung repair","undifferentiated SP-C","chronic lung disease","co-expression of CCSP","described cell population","cell suspensions","development of diseases","minor population of CD34","CD34 magnetic positive-cell sorting","development of new therapeutics","expression of specialized genes","ovine lungs","dissociated lungs","present ex","dual differentiation potential","various extracellular matrices","large animal","NANOG","OCT4","alveolar epithelial type","immunohistochemistry","synthetic media","important populations","sheep","lesions","embryogenesis","BMI1","flow cytometry","frozen sections","time","regeneration","Immunocytochemistry","characterization","cancers","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","study","culture","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The most active fraction and these compounds were also assayed to determine the viral multiplication step(s) upon which they act as well as their potential synergistic effects.

With concerns that this vulnerable group could be at higher risk of contracting the disease or spreading it to others, the implementation of health promotion activities appropriate to this group was considered to be essential during the epidemic. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of delivering a telephone health education programme dealing with anxiety levels, and knowledge and practice of measures to prevent transmission of SARS among a group of older adults with low SES. Design Pretest/posttest design. Settings Subjects were recruited from registered members of a government subsidized social service center in Hong Kong and living in low-cost housing estates. Participants The eligibility criteria were: (1) aged 55 or above; (2) able to speak Cantonese; (3) no hearing impairment, and (4) reachable by telephone. Of the 295 eligible subjects, 122 older adults completed the whole study. Methods The interviewers approached all eligible subjects by telephone during the period of 15\u201325 May 2003. After obtaining the participants\u2019 verbal consent, the interviewer collected baseline data by use of a questionnaire and implemented a health education programme. A follow-up telephone call was made a week later using the same questionnaire. Results The level of anxiety was lowered (t=3.28, p\u003C0.001), and knowledge regarding the transmission routes of droplets (p\u003C0.001) and urine and feaces (p\u003C0.01) were improved after the intervention. Although statistical significant difference was found in the practice of identified preventive measures before and after intervention, influence on behavioral changes needed further exploration. Conclusion The telephone health education seemed to be effective in relieving anxiety and improving knowledge of the main transmission routes of SARS in this group, but not the practice of preventing SARS. Telephone contact appears to be a practical way of providing health education to vulnerable groups when face-to-face measure is not feasible and may be useful in raising health awareness during future outbreaks of emerging infections.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Sophia S.C.; So, Winnie K.W.; Wong, David C.N.; Lee, Angel C.K.; Tiwari, Agnes","journal":"International Journal of Nursing Studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/720937e57c7f2604c9ab4c653dafe12b73e9f63f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094290.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748906001313; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020748906001313","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SES","SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["telephone health education programme","health awareness","group of older adults","transmission of SARS","Telephone contact","follow-up telephone","knowledge","implementation of health promotion activities appropriate","main transmission routes of SARS","eligible subjects","practice of measures","Hong Kong","anxiety levels","low SES","transmission routes of droplets","relieving anxiety","level of anxiety","Settings Subjects","questionnaire","intervention","vulnerable groups","preventive measures","Design Pretest","posttest design","low socio-economic status","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","government","social service center","baseline data","registered members","face-to-face measure","future outbreaks of emerging infections","influence","practical way","challenges","Abstract Background","participants\u2019 verbal consent","behavioral changes","use","higher risk","interviewers","effectiveness","low-cost housing estates","exploration","Methods","urine","week","period","Conclusion","statistical significant difference","Cantonese","eligibility criteria","hearing impairment","disease","feaces","study","concerns","epidemic","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

For many years, baculoviruses have been applied as targeted biocontrol agents against forestry and agriculture pests. Baculovirus insecticides are effective against insect pests such as velvetbean caterpillar (Anticarsia gemmatalis), cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa zea), and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). Baculoviruses are transmitted to insects by the oral route mediated by the occlusion-derived virus (ODV). The ODV is also specialized to exploit the insect midgut that is one of the most extreme biological environments where the viruses are subject to caustic pH and digestive proteases. The molecular biology of the ODV reveals new frontiers in protein chemistry. Finally, ODVs establishes infection in insect gut tissues that are virtually nonsupportive to virus replication and which are continuously sloughed away. ODVs carry with them a battery of proteins that enable them to rapidly exploit and harness these unstable cells for virus replication.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slack, Jeffery; Arif, Basil M.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fadf4fb25c197f042a64d5aaf13a10335288d0b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112300.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352706690039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352706690039","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ODV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["insect pests","insect midgut","virus replication","insect gut tissues","size of insect populations","ODVs","Publisher Summary Baculoviruses","occlusion-derived virus","agriculture pests","important ecological role","Anticarsia gemmatalis","velvetbean caterpillar","Helicoverpa zea","cotton bollworm","new frontiers","targeted biocontrol agents","gypsy moth","caustic pH","forestry","nonsupportive","digestive proteases","protein chemistry","infection","Baculovirus insecticides","extreme biological environments","oral route","molecular biology","Lymantria dispar","insects","unstable cells","battery of proteins","years"],"language":"en"},

With its high economic burden, it is considered a disease of major public health importance by the World Health Organization. The link between respiratory tract infections and acute exacerbation has been recognized for a long time. The aim of this retrospective study in routine care was to evaluate our practices concerning microbiological prescriptions in children hospitalized for asthma exacerbation. STUDY DESIGN: All children aged from 2 to 15 years hospitalized for asthma exacerbation between January 2010 and December 2011 in our unit were included in the study. Microbiological prescriptions, their indications, their results, and their cost were studied. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven children were included in the study. A potential causative agent was sought in 79.7% of the children (n = 157) by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The main indications were upper airway infections, hypoxemia, and pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 23.8% of them (30/126). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by PCR in only 3.2% of these patients (4/125). No other bacterial agent was identified. There was no correlation between the severity of asthma exacerbation and the microbiological diagnosis of infection. The results did not influence the therapy given. These prescriptions represented a substantial cost for each child. CONCLUSION: These analyses do not seem to have a real advantage for the patient except for epidemiology. It would be important to conduct a new study analyzing the role of rhinovirus, and of other viruses such as coronavirus, bocavirus, and enterovirus, not routinely investigated in our hospital, and to question the value of these costly microbiological tests.","publish_time":"2014-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sauvaget, E.; Bresson, V.; Oudyi, M.; Bosdure, E.; Loundou, A.-D.; Chabrol, B.; Charrel, R.; Dubus, J.-C.","journal":"Arch Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c8bed54ed240f5412d435914ec507b190f8bcd8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7133295.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25284733/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2014.08.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","microbiological prescriptions","severity of asthma exacerbation","new study","retrospective study","STUDY DESIGN","results","acute exacerbation","microbiological diagnosis of infection","costly microbiological tests","PCR","Viruses","main indications","substantial cost","bacterial agent","disease of major public health importance","upper airway infections","World Health Organization","respiratory tract infections","common chronic disease","potential causative agent","hypoxemia","practices","routine care","IFA","link","value","polymerase chain reaction","role of rhinovirus","real advantage","epidemiology","immunofluorescence assay","coronavirus","bocavirus","childhood","aim","correlation","years","high economic burden","enterovirus","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","BACKGROUND","long time","CONCLUSION","analyses","hospital","therapy","unit","patients"],"language":"en"},

In hospitals, the risk of virus diffusion mainly depends on air flow behavior and changes in direction caused by supply air and exhaust air locations. An improved isolation room ventilation strategy has been suggested, and is found to be the most efficient in removing contaminants based on the observations and simulation results from three ventilation systems. The results show that ventilation systems utilizing the \u201Clow-level extraction\u201D technique are very effective at removing pollutants in the human breathing zone.

Here, we utilized the in-silico approaches to identify possible protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. Potential compounds were screened from the CHEMBL database, ZINC database, FDA approved drugs and molecules under clinical trials. Our study is based on 6Y2F and 6W63 co-crystallized structures available in the protein data bank (PDB). Seven hundred compounds from ZINC/CHEMBL databases and fourteen hundred compounds from drug-bank were selected based on positive interactions with the reported binding site. All the selected compounds were subjected to standard-precision (SP) and extra-precision (XP) mode of docking. Generated docked poses were carefully visualized for known interactions within the binding site. Molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations were performed to screen the best compounds based on docking scores and binding energy values. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out on four selected compounds from the CHEMBL database to validate the stability and interactions. MD simulations were also performed on the PDB structure 6YF2F to understand the differences between screened molecules and co-crystallized ligand. We screened 300 potential compounds from various databases, and 66 potential compounds from FDA approved drugs. Cobicistat, ritonavir, lopinavir, and darunavir are in the top screened molecules from FDA approved drugs.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we found that TGEV infection severely disrupted intestinal homeostasis via inhibition of self-renewal and differentiation in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Profoundly, TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex-mediated the inactivation of Notch signaling provided a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Initial invasions by TGEV-targeted Paneth cells through aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor, then inducing mitochondrial damage and ROS generation in them, ultimately causing Paneth cell decrease and loss of Notch factors (DII4 and Hes5), which are essential for Lgr5 ISCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interestingly, loss of Notch signaling induced goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive enterocytes and promoted mucins secretion, which accelerated TGEV replication. Therefore, the more differentiation of goblet cells, the greater TGEV infection in jejunum. These results provide a detailed mechanistic pathway by which villous atrophy sharply occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum within 48 h. Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a \u201Cbottom up scenario\u201D, which is contrary to the traditional \u201Ctop down\u201D hypothesis. Together, our findings provide a potential link between diarrheal virus infection and crypt cells response that regulates Paneth cells function and Lgr5 ISCs fate and could be exploited for therapeutic application.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Aimin; Yu, Bing; Zhang, Keying; Xu, Zhiwen; Wu, De; He, Jun; Luo, Junqiu; Luo, Yuheng; Yu, Jie; Zheng, Ping; Che, Lianqiang; Mao, Xiangbing; Huang, Zhiqing; Wang, Lan; Zhao, Jun; Chen, Daiwen","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/486ad1536fb8f8a3ac0f4a38ee97fc8af2435cc0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6971083.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31959773/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-2233-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV-targeted Paneth cells","TGEV replication","pathogenesis of TGEV","greater TGEV infection","differentiation of goblet cells","TGEV-infected jejunum","Paneth cells function","TGEV-encoded NSP10","Lgr5 intestinal stem cells","induced goblet cells differentiation","crypt cells response","Lgr5 ISCs self-renewal","diarrheal virus infection","Lgr5 ISCs fate","disrupted intestinal homeostasis","inactivation of Notch","loss of Notch factors","villous atrophy","inhibition of self-renewal","mechanistic explanation","detailed mechanistic pathway","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","aminopeptidase N","NSP16 protein complex","cost of absorptive enterocytes","APN","mucins secretion","potential link","receptor","mitochondrial damage","Initial invasions","Hes5","DII4","ROS generation","findings","results","underlying mechanisms","phenomenon","study","therapeutic application","scenario","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Accordingly, the serological detection of corresponding antibodies would be beneficial to diagnose PEDV indirectly to control the disease. In this study, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the recombinant truncated spike (S) protein of PEDV was developed and validated. RESULTS: The reaction conditions of the developed indirect ELISA were optimized. This indirect ELISA was compared to indirect immunoinfluscent assay (IFA), and the overall coincidence rate was 96.74% based on testing 368 clinical serum samples with different PEDV antibody levels. No cross-reactivity with other common swine pathogens was detected for the developed S1 indirect ELISA. Finally, the S1 indirect ELISA was applied to detect serum antibodies of 3304 field samples collected from different pig farms in eastern China, and it presented an overall substantial agreement on the PEDV infection status. CONCLUSIONS: This established S1 indirect ELISA is capable of detecting serum antibodies against PEDV, and due to its high sensitivity and specificity, it could be applied for serological evaluation and indirect diagnosis of PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2018-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Huixing; Zhou, Hong; Gao, Lu; Li, Bin; He, Kongwang; Fan, Hongjie","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb833d8df33cd6cc025d22afa9b7831725ea0afb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6102851.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30126390/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1570-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed indirect ELISA","developed S1 indirect ELISA","indirect diagnosis of PEDV infection","established S1 indirect ELISA","protein of PEDV","indirect immunoinfluscent assay","PEDV infection status","serum antibodies","different PEDV antibody levels","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","clinical serum samples","economies of swine","serological detection of corresponding antibodies","common swine pathogens","major causative agent of swine viral diarrhea","field samples","serological evaluation","different pig farms","overall substantial agreement","overall coincidence rate","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","recombinant truncated spike","testing","IFA","reaction conditions","eastern China","massive losses","CONCLUSIONS","cross-reactivity","BACKGROUND","study","high sensitivity","specificity","RESULTS","countries","disease"],"language":"en"},

As a consequence of viral RNA degradation, infected cells can accumulate virus\u2010derived small RNAs at high levels compared to cellular molecules. These small RNAs are imprinted with molecular characteristics that reflect their origin. First, small RNAs can be used to reconstruct viral sequences and identify the virus from which they originated. Second, other molecular features of small RNAs such as size, polarity, and base preferences depend on the type of viral substrate and host mechanism of degradation. Thus, the pattern of small RNAs generated in infected cells can be used as a molecular footprint to identify and characterize viruses independent on sequence homology searches against known references. Hence, sequencing of small RNAs obtained from infected cells enables virus discovery and characterization using both sequence\u2010dependent strategies and novel pattern\u2010based approaches.

Their effective usefulness as biomarkers resides in their stability and high availability in all the biological fluids, combined with the limited invasiveness of intervention. Among the circulating molecules, miRNAs represent a novel class of biomarkers as they possess all the required characteristics such as sensitivity, predictivity, specificity, robustness, translatability, and noninvasiveness. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, that act as inhibitors of protein translation, and intervene in the complex network of the post-transcriptional mechanisms finely regulating gene expression. The emerging role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers for clinical applications (e.g., cancer and cardiovascular diseases diagnosis and prediction, musculoskeletal disease diagnosis and bone fracture risk prediction), however, requires the standardization of miRNA processing, from sample collection and sample storage, to RNA isolation, RNA reverse-transcription, and data analyses. Normalization is one of the most controversial issues related to quantitative Real-Time PCR data analysis since no universally accepted normalization strategies and reference genes exist, even more importantly, for circulating miRNA quantification. As it is widely demonstrated that the choice of different normalization strategies influences the results of gene expression analysis, it is important to select the most appropriate normalizers for each experimental set. This review discloses on the different strategies adopted in RT-qPCR miRNA normalization and the concerning issues to highlight on the need of a universally accepted methodology to make comparable the results produced by different studies.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faraldi, Martina; Gomarasca, Marta; Banfi, Giuseppe; Lombardi, Giovanni","journal":"Advances in Clinical Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2934f58cc9a896c0490861fb4be66fad771a6f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112021.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.acc.2018.07.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065242318300386; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065242318300386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30342709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential biomarkers","accepted normalization strategies","different strategies","choice of different normalization strategies","RT-qPCR miRNA normalization","results of gene expression analysis","novel class of biomarkers","different studies","miRNA quantification","Abstract Circulating molecules","emerging role of miRNAs","standardization of miRNA processing","RNA isolation","sample storage","sample collection","controversial issues","accepted methodology","concerning issues","data analyses","quantitative Real-Time PCR data analysis","musculoskeletal disease diagnosis","cardiovascular diseases diagnosis","RNA reverse-transcription","bone fracture risk prediction","predictivity","post-transcriptional mechanisms","cancer","specific stimuli","clinical applications","robustness","sensitivity","biological fluids","complex network","high availability","small non-coding RNAs","appropriate normalizers","translatability","specificity","circulation","response","stability","need","pathological processes","reference genes","required characteristics","limited invasiveness of intervention","experimental set","inhibitors of protein translation","effective usefulness","noninvasiveness","review"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0\u20133.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6\u201314.6%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9\u20138.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI 5.7\u20138.9%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Barbouni, Anastasia; Niaura, Raymond","journal":"Intern Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0add73701e755696c13cbaa63b9378a24fe2879b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7210099.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02355-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385628/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Corona Virus Disease"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["current smoking prevalence","pooled prevalence of current smoking","low prevalence of current smoking","current smokers","effects of smoking","smoking status","China","CI","pooled analysis","hospitalized patients","studies","secondary analysis","clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID","pooled estimate","high-population","random-effect meta-analysis","well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine","pharmaceutical nicotine","findings","measure","Corona Virus Disease","presenting data","health risk","potential treatment option","systematic review","literature","PubMed","generalized advice","admission","study","conclusion","hospitalization","purpose","total","possibility"],"language":"en"},

In Europe, brucellosis has been eradicated in domestic ruminants from most countries and wild ruminants have not been considered important reservoirs so far. However, a high prevalence of Brucella melitensis infection has been recently identified in a French population of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), after the emergence of brucellosis was confirmed in a dairy cattle farm and two human cases. This situation raised the need to identify the factors driving the persistence of Brucella infection at high prevalence levels in this ibex population. In the present paper, we studied the shedding pattern of B. melitensis in ibex from Bargy Massif, French Alps. Bacteriological examinations (1\u201315 tissues/samples per individual) were performed on 88 seropositive, supposedly infected and euthanized individuals. Among them, 51 (58%) showed at least one positive culture, including 45 ibex with at least one Brucella isolation from a urogenital sample or a lymph node in the pelvic area (active infection in organs in the pelvic area). Among these 45 ibex, 26 (30% of the total number of necropsied animals) showed at least one positive culture for a urogenital organ and were considered as being at risk of shedding the bacteria at the time of capture. We observed significant heterogeneity between sex-and-age classes: seropositive females were most at risk to excrete Brucella before the age of 5 years, possibly corresponding to abortion during the first pregnancy following infection such as reported in the domestic ruminants. The high shedding potential observed in young females may have contributed to the self-sustained maintenance of infection in this population, whereas males are supposed to play a role of transmission between spatial units through venereal transmission during mating. This heterogeneity in the shedding potential of seropositive individuals should be considered in the future to better evaluate management scenarios in this system as well as in others.","publish_time":"2018-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lambert, S\u00E9bastien; Gilot-Fromont, Emmanuelle; Freycon, Pauline; Th\u00E9bault, Anne; Game, Yvette; To\u00EFgo, Carole; Petit, Elodie; Barthe, Marie-No\u00EBlle; Reynaud, Ga\u00EBl; Ja\u00FF, Maryne; Garin-Bastuji, Bruno; Ponsart, Claire; Hars, Jean; Rossi, Sophie","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/648043eabf0ac87a2bd28909cd4a739f8b2c4a35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5985404.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29892274/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["ibex population","Capra ibex","persistence of Brucella infection","high prevalence of Brucella melitensis infection","active infection","French population of Alpine ibex","high shedding potential","shedding potential of seropositive individuals","seropositive females","Brucella isolation","domestic ruminants","shedding pattern of","high prevalence levels","pelvic area","self-sustained maintenance of infection","wild ruminants","positive culture","risk","venereal transmission","role of transmission","urogenital sample","young females","French Alps","age classes","management scenarios","urogenital organ","important reservoirs","euthanized individuals","emergence of brucellosis","significant heterogeneity","major management issues","Wildlife reservoirs of infectious diseases","spatial units","organs","lymph node","Bargy Massif","dairy cattle farm","tissues","human cases","mating","sex","factors","countries","total number of necropsied animals","bacteria","future","abortion","years","present paper","time of capture","Bacteriological examinations","need","samples","system","pregnancy","situation","Europe"],"language":"en"},

Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis. We also discuss strategies to improve our understanding of viral sepsis, and ways we can integrate this new information into effective treatment.","publish_time":"2018-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Gu-Lung; McGinley, Joseph P.; Drysdale, Simon B.; Pollard, Andrew J.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/517aa0b6c174589d7183d73b1ce2f3787d86e369.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6170629.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30319615/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02147","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of sepsis","bacterial sepsis","sepsis presentations","understanding of viral sepsis","diagnosis of viral sepsis","prevalence of viral sepsis","non-bacterial causes of sepsis","majority of sepsis cases","severe viral infections","bacterial infections","culture negative","unnecessary antimicrobial use","host microbiome","antimicrobial resistance","common causes","inappropriate treatment","new information","effective treatment","dysregulated host response","immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics","effects","associated consequences","immune responses","life-threatening organ dysfunction","ways","absence of definite diagnostic criteria","vulnerable patients","excess healthcare costs","infants","neonates","initial standard of care","broad range of pathogens","virus","immunosuppressed groups","appropriate treatments","accurate estimate","strategies","outcomes","review"],"language":"en"},

High expression of active single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) in Escherichia coli has not been successful, as the protein contains three intramolecular disulfide bonds that are difficult to form correctly in the bacterial intracellular environment. To solve this problem, we fused the scFv gene against VEGF165 with a small ubiquitin-related modifier gene (SUMO) by synthesizing an artificial SUMO\u2013scFv fusion gene that was highly expressed in the BL21(DE3) strain. The optimal expression level of the soluble fusion protein, SUMO\u2013scFv, was up to 28.5% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by Ni nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) affinity chromatography and cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease to obtain the native scFv, which was further purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The result of the high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the purity of the recombinant cleaved scFv was greater than 98%. The primary structure of the purified scFv was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analysis. In vitro activity assay demonstrated that the recombinant scFv could dose-dependently inhibit VEGF165-induced human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cell proliferation.

Viruses contribute significantly to pneumonia burden, although data for low-income and tropical countries are scarce. The aim of this laboratory-enhanced, hospital-based surveillance was to characterise the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections among refugees living on the Thailand-Myanmar border. METHODS: Maela camp provides shelter for ~45,000 refugees. Inside the camp, a humanitarian organisation provides free hospital care in a 158-bed inpatient department (IPD). Between 1st April 2009 and 30th September 2011, all patients admitted to the IPD with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia were invited to participate. Clinical symptoms and signs were recorded and a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) collected. NPAs were tested for adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza A \u0026 B, and RSV by PCR. RESULTS: Seven hundred eight patient episodes (698 patients) diagnosed as pneumonia during the enhanced surveillance period were included in this analysis. The median patient age was 1 year (range: \u003C 1-70), and 90.4% were aged \u003C 5 years. At least one virus was detected in 53.7% (380/708) of episodes. Virus detection was more common in children aged \u003C 5 years old (\u003C1 year: OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.4, p = 0.01; 1-4 years: OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.8-2.3, p = 0.2). RSV was detected in 176/708 (24.9%); an adenovirus in 133/708 (18.8%); an influenza virus in 68/708 (9.6%); and hMPV in 33/708 (4.7%). Twenty-eight episodes of multiple viral infections were identified, most commonly adenovirus plus another virus. RSV was more likely to be detected in children \u003C5 years (OR 12.3, 95% CI 3.0-50.8, p = 0.001) and influenza viruses in patients \u22655 years (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.4, p = 0.002). IPD treatment was documented in 702/708 cases; all but one patient received antimicrobials, most commonly a beta-lactam (amoxicillin/ampicillin \u002B/\u2212gentamicin in 664/701, 94.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Viral nucleic acid was identified in the nasopharynx in half the patients admitted with clinically diagnosed pneumonia. Development of immunisations targeting common respiratory viruses is likely to reduce the incidence of pneumonia in children living refugee camps and similar settings.","publish_time":"2013-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turner, Paul; Turner, Claudia; Watthanaworawit, Wanitda; Carrara, Verena; Cicelia, Naw; Deglise, Carole; Phares, Christina; Ortega, Luis; Nosten, Francois","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a79ac3a49714d75cfc75c28df0a4e33d9362969.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3847692.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498873/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-434","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPD","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","incidence of pneumonia","pneumonia burden","children","influenza viruses","clinical diagnosis of pneumonia","patient episodes","years old","Virus detection","RSV","epidemiology of respiratory virus infections","common respiratory viruses","refugees","episodes of multiple viral infections","IPD treatment","hMPV","hospital-based surveillance","median patient age","enhanced surveillance period","Maela camp","Clinical symptoms","free hospital care","Viral nucleic acid","refugee camps","significant cause of morbidity","mortality","humanitarian organisation","data","human metapneumovirus","Development of immunisations","amoxicillin","ampicillin","tropical countries","signs","adenoviruses","similar settings","bed inpatient department","shelter","beta-lactam","nasopharyngeal aspirate","developing world","laboratory","METHODS","Thailand-Myanmar border","CONCLUSIONS","nasopharynx","BACKGROUND","range","cases","gentamicin","NPAs","analysis","PCR","antimicrobials","RESULTS","aim"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, the dynamics of IFN\u03B1/\u03B2 induction and responsiveness by central nervous system (CNS) resident cells in vivo in response to viral infections are poorly understood. Mice were infected with a neurotropic coronavirus with tropism for oligodendroglia and microglia to probe innate antiviral responses during acute encephalomyelitis. Expression of genes associated with the IFN\u03B1/\u03B2 pathways were monitored in microglia and oligodendroglia purified from na\u00EFve and infected mice by fluorescent activated cell sorting. Compared to microglia, oligodendroglia were characterized by low basal expression of mRNA encoding viral RNA sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), IFN\u03B1/\u03B2 receptor chains, interferon sensitive genes (ISG), as well as kinases and transcription factors critical in IFN\u03B1/\u03B2 signaling. Although PRRs and ISGs were upregulated by infection in both cell types, the repertoire and absolute mRNA levels were more limited in oligodendroglia. Furthermore, although oligodendroglia harbored higher levels of viral RNA compared to microglia, Ifn\u03B1/\u03B2 was only induced in microglia. Stimulation with the double stranded RNA analogue poly I:C also failed to induce Ifn\u03B1/\u03B2 in oligodendroglia, and resulted in reduced and delayed induction of ISGs compared to microglia. The limited antiviral response by oligodendroglia was associated with a high threshold for upregulation of Ikk\u03B5 and Irf7 transcripts, both central to amplifying IFN\u03B1/\u03B2 responses. Overall, these data reveal that oligodendroglia from the adult CNS are poor sensors of viral infection and suggest they require exogenous IFN\u03B1/\u03B2 to establish an antiviral state.","publish_time":"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kapil, Parul; Butchi, Niranjan B.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","journal":"Glia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80359465f0ac1ad4539099defea5eeb16efb518c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/622a5bc6b52302807257f0303ccde742d399fda1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3422432.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.22375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22736486/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3422432?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oligodendroglia","microglia","\u03B2 induction","\u03B2 responses","exogenous IFN\u03B1","dynamics of IFN\u03B1","\u03B2 pathways","\u03B2 receptor chains","higher levels of viral RNA","viral infections","limited antiviral response","poor sensors of viral infection","PRRs","Expression of genes","innate antiviral responses","infected mice","antiviral state","viral RNA sensing pattern recognition receptors","absolute mRNA levels","delayed induction of ISGs","adult CNS","low basal expression of mRNA","cell types","double stranded RNA analogue poly","central nervous system","interferon sensitive genes","fluorescent activated cell sorting","resident cells","responsiveness","upregulation of Ikk\u03B5","Irf7 transcripts","kinases","repertoire","transcription factors critical","high threshold","neurotropic coronavirus","Stimulation","acute encephalomyelitis","tropism","primary defense","data","interferons"],"language":"en"},

The former strategy is non-compatible for characterizing properties innate to RNA strands such as secondary structure, RNA\u2013RNA interactions, and also for nanopore direct RNA sequencing involving the sequencing of native RNA strands. The latter strategy, ultracentrifugation, causes loss in genomic information due to its inability to retrieve unassembled viral RNA. To address this, we developed a novel application of current nucleic acid hybridization technologies for direct characterization of RNA. In particular, we modified a current enrichment protocol to capture whole viral native RNA genomes for downstream RNA assays to circumvent the abovementioned problems. This technique involves hybridization of biotinylated baits at 500 nucleotides (nt) intervals, stringent washes and release of free native RNA strands using DNase I treatment, with a turnaround time of about 6 h 15 min. RT-qPCR was used as the primary proof of concept that capture-based purification indeed removes host background. Subsequently, capture-based purification was applied to direct RNA sequencing as proof of concept that capture-based purification can be coupled with downstream RNA assays. We report that this protocol was able to successfully purify viral RNA by 561- to 791-fold. We also report that application of this protocol to direct RNA sequencing yielded a reduction in human host RNA background by 1580-fold, a 99.91% recovery of viral genome with at least 15\u00D7 coverage, and a mean coverage across the genome of 120\u00D7. This report is, to the best of our knowledge, the first description of a capture-based purification method for assays that involve direct manipulation or characterisation of native RNA. This report also describes a successful application of capture-based purification as a direct RNA sequencing strategy that addresses certain limitations of current strategies in sequencing RNA viral genomes.

The risk of transfer can be modeled using harmless viruses to obtain quantitative data. To determine whether double-gloving reduces virus transfer to HCWs\u2019 hands and clothing during removal of contaminated PPE, we conducted a human challenge study using bacteriophages to compare the frequency and quantity of virus transfer to hands and clothes during PPE removal with single-gloving and double-gloving technique. Methods Each experiment had a double-gloving phase and a single-gloving phase. Participants donned PPE (ie, contact isolation gown, N95 respirator, eye protection, latex gloves). The gown, respirator, eye protection, and dominant glove were contaminated with bacteriophage. Participants then removed the PPE, and their hands, face, and scrubs were sampled for virus. Results Transfer of virus to hands during PPE removal was significantly more frequent with single-gloving than with double-gloving. Transfer to scrubs was similar during single-gloving and double-gloving. The amount of virus transfer to hands ranged from 0.15 to 2.5 log10 most probable number. Significantly more virus was transferred to participants\u2019 hands after single-gloving than after double-gloving. Conclusions Our comparison of double-gloving and single-gloving using a simulation system with MS2 and a most-probable number method suggests that double gloving can reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs\u2019 hands during PPE removal. If incorporated into practice when full PPE is worn, this practice may reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs\u2019 hands during PPE removal. The use of double gloves should be explored in larger controlled studies.","publish_time":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Casanova, Lisa M.; Rutala, William A.; Weber, David J.; Sobsey, Mark D.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f75777da1f595e72a9e488a39bbc8c55f0af672.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115263.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21831480/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2011.04.324; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655311006882; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655311006882","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["double gloving","double-gloving phase","double-gloving technique","PPE removal","single-gloving phase","removal of contaminated PPE","participants\u2019 hands","quantity of virus transfer","risk of transfer","Results Transfer of virus","comparison of double","use of double gloves","risk of viral contamination of HCWs","removal of personal protective equipment","eye protection","scrubs","practice","probable number method","N95 respirator","clothing of health care workers","patient care","isolation gown","latex gloves","clothes","bacteriophages","MS2","frequency","dominant glove","human challenge study","harmless viruses","simulation system","experiment","quantitative data","larger controlled studies","log10","face","Conclusions","Methods"],"language":"en"},

It can be successfully prevented with live attenuated CPV-2 vaccines when given at the appropriate age and in the absence of maternal antibody interference. Rapid diagnosis of parvoviral enteritis in young dogs is essential to ensuring suitable barrier nursing protocols within veterinary hospitals. The current diagnostic trend is to use multiplexed PCR panels to detect an array of pathogens commonly responsible for diarrhea in dogs. The multiplexed PCR assays do not distinguish wild from vaccine CPV-2. They are highly sensitive and detect even a low level of virus shedding, such as those caused by the CPV-2 vaccine. The aim of this study was to identify the CPV-2 subtypes detected in diagnostic specimens and rule out occult shedding of CPV-2 vaccine strains. For a total of 21 samples that tested positive for CPV-2 in a small animal fecal pathogens diagnostic multiplexed tandem PCR (MT-PCR) panel during 2014\u20132016 we partially characterized the VP2 gene of CPV-2. Vaccine CPV-2 strain, wild type CPV-2a subtypes and vaccine-like CPV-2b subtypes were detected. High copy number was indicative of wild-type CPV-2a presence, but presence of vaccine-like CPV-2b had a variable copy number in fecal samples. A yardstick approach to a copy number or C(t)-value to discriminate vaccine strain from a wild type virus of CPV-2 can be, in some cases, potentially misleading. Therefore, discriminating vaccine strain from a wild type subtype of CPV-2 remains ambitious.","publish_time":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meggiolaro, Maira N.; Ly, Anna; Rysnik-Steck, Benjamin; Silva, Carolina; Zhang, Joshua; Higgins, Damien P.; Muscatello, Gary; Norris, Jacqueline M.; Krockenberger, Mark; \u0160lapeta, Jan","journal":"Mol Cell Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8dc402c1d9094683f65a385a921fc1c511e4fef1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125668.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850817300191; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850817300191; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2017.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254505/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine CPV","wild type CPV","wild type virus of CPV","wild type subtype of CPV","occult shedding of CPV","live attenuated CPV","VP2 gene of CPV","presence of vaccine","vaccine strains","indicative of wild","multiplexed PCR panels","multiplexed PCR assays","MT-PCR","young dogs","b subtypes","variable copy number","High copy number","small animal fecal pathogens diagnostic multiplexed tandem PCR","diagnostic specimens","fecal samples","current diagnostic trend","array of pathogens","low level of virus shedding","Rapid diagnosis of parvoviral enteritis","important cause of devastating enteritis","suitable barrier nursing protocols","veterinary hospitals","vaccines","diarrhea","value","absence of maternal antibody interference","appropriate age","yardstick approach","total","study","Canine parvovirus","cases","aim"],"language":"en"},

For the period post-2020, one of the most relevant changes could be the upgrading of the crops diversification, imposing it as an obligation to rotate crops by introducing legumes in the cropping patterns. This paper proposes an assessment of the possible effects of such obligation on the arable crops sector in Italy. The analysis uses a mathematical programming model calibrated and validated by way positive approach and is conducted on data of about 2800 Italian farms of the Farm Accountancy Data Network. Moreover, the analysis is structured by geographical area and altimetric level in order to consider typical specificities of Italian farms according to their localization. Our results show the legume-supported crop rotations reduce the general environmental pressure of agricultural activities and affect a large part of the arable land, against reduced economic impacts. In the majority of farms the lost income per hectare is lower than the national average value of the decoupled payments. Yet, the legume-supported crop rotations determine a reduction in the production of main crops and, especially in some areas, negative economic and social impacts. All this suggests that the legume-supported crop rotations are an opportunity to adopting sustainable agricultural practices and that Member States could implement the agronomic practice differently for areas and use additional instruments to meet the EU\u0027s objectives. Especially the decoupled and coupled payments are needed to limit economic losses and incentivize farmers towards virtuous behaviour.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cortignani, Raffaele; Dono, Gabriele","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61492f146a7b46c583d859366c873686c3a7437f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720329818?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425253/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139464; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720329818","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Common Agricultural Policy","Farm Accountancy Data Network","EU"],"locations":["European Union"],"keyphrases":["crop rotations","crops diversification","arable crops sector","economic losses","areas","majority of farms","reduced economic impacts","obligation","decoupled payments","production of main crops","analysis","typical specificities of Italian farms","sustainable agricultural practices","Common Agricultural Policy","general environmental pressure of agricultural activities","arable land","gradual integration of environmental objectives","social impacts","EU\u0027s objectives","Farm Accountancy Data Network","order","Member States","hectare","national average value","altimetric level","geographical area","lost income","opportunity","reduction","agronomic practice","additional instruments","mathematical programming model","possible effects","farmers","upgrading","legumes","way positive approach","virtuous behaviour","assessment","Italy","cropping patterns","European Union","relevant changes","paper","localization","results","period post-","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Four species of small interfering RNA (siRNA), targeting different regions of the PHE-CoV spike glycoprotein and replicase polyprotein genes, were prepared by in vitro transcription. After transfection of PK-15 cells with each of the siRNAs followed by infection with PHE-CoV, the cytopathic effect (CPE) was examined by phase-contrast microscope, and viral proliferation within cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, hemagglutination (HA) test, TCID(50) assay and real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Examination of CPE demonstrated that the four siRNAs were capable of protecting cells against PHE-CoV invasion with very high specificity and efficiency. At 48 h post-infection, only a few siRNA-treated cells were positive for viral antigen staining, whereas most untreated virus-infected cells were positive. Transfection with siRNAs also suppressed the production of infectious virus by up to 18- to 32-fold as assessed by a HA test and 93- to 494-fold as assessed by TCID(50) assay. Furthermore, treatment with siRNAs caused a 53-91% reduction in the viral genome copy number as assessed by real-time RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that the four species of siRNAs can efficiently inhibit PHE-CoV genome replication and infectious virus production.","publish_time":"2011-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lan, Y.; Lan, Yungang; Lu, Huijun; Zhao, Kui; He, Wenqi; Chen, Keyan; Wang, GaiLi; Song, Deguang; Gao, Feng","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90695778d85ce96665b76564554d0eae7bb1a360.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179546.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000323523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21372550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCID","CPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PHE-CoV invasion","PHE-CoV genome replication","species of siRNAs","PHE-CoV spike glycoprotein","untreated virus-infected cells","siRNA-treated cells","production of infectious virus","infectious virus production","viral genome","viral proliferation","HA test","TCID","real-time RT-PCR","assay","RESULTS","fold","replication of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","viral antigen staining","specific effect of RNA interference","species of small interfering RNA","cytopathic effect","Examination of CPE","transfection of PK","h post-infection","hemagglutination","replicase polyprotein genes","indirect immunofluorescence microscopy","number","different regions","high specificity","phase-contrast microscope","efficiency","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","reduction","transcription","CONCLUSION","treatment"],"language":"en"},

Here we report the structural and functional characterization of G2, a neutralizing antibody targeting MERS-CoV S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD). Structures of G2 alone and in complex with the MERS-CoV S1-NTD defined a site of vulnerability comprising two loops, each of which contained a residue mutated in G2-escape variants. Cell-surface binding studies and in vitro competition experiments demonstrated that G2 strongly disrupts the attachment of MERS-CoV S to its receptor DDP4, with the inhibition requiring the native trimeric S conformation.

The antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the 1162-residue sequence. The N-terminal region of one of the two subunits, S2, was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies. This clearly immunodominant region contains at least two adjacent or overlapping epitopes, one of which has been localized within 18 residues. The epitopes found as antigenic pEX expression products do not coincide with the regions in the S1 subunit that have been found to contain hypervariable sequences. We suggest that these regions constitute conformation dependent neutralization epitopes that cannot be detected in the pEX system.

We examined the in vitro translation property of the conserved MHV 5\u2032leader RNA sequence by constructing chimeric mRNAs in which the 72-nt 5\u2032-leader of M protein mRNA (A59 strain) was positioned upstream of the human \u03B1-globin coding region in a T7 expression vector. Synthetic 5\u2032-capped transcripts of these mRNA constructs were translated in cell-free extracts prepared from uninfected and MHV-infected murine DBT cells. Nonviral mRNAs translated readily in both uninfected and infected cell-free extracts. By contrast, replacement of the human \u03B1-globin 5\u2032-untranslated region (UR) with the MHV 5\u2032-leader increased translation ca. three- to fourfold in cell-free extracts from MHV-infected cells versus translation in extracts from uninfected cells. Chimeric globin mRNA containing the reverse complementary sequence of the viral leader RNA in the 5\u2032-UR showed no such increase in translation, indicating sequence specificity for the effect. A 13-nt region (-UCUAAUCCAAACA-) immediately proximal to the start codon was found to be important for the increased translation of the MHV leader-containing mRNAs. These data indicate that the apparent down-regulation of host translation is not primarily due to an inhibition of host translation but also involves a significant stimulation of viral translation in cis by a structural feature of the MHV 5\u2032-leader RNA sequence in conjunction with a virus-specified or virus-induced factor.","publish_time":"1994-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tahara, Stanley M.; Dietlin, Therese A.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.; Nelson, Gary W.; Kyuwa, Shigeru; Anthony, Richard P.; Stohlman, Stephen A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682284713833; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682284713833","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV leader","MHV-infected cells","increased translation","translation property","leader RNA sequence","conserved MHV","viral leader RNA","regulation of host translation","inhibition of host translation","MHV-infected murine DBT cells","uninfected cells","infected cell-free extracts","significant stimulation of viral translation","protein mRNA","viral protein synthesis","Chimeric globin mRNA","sequence specificity","Abstract Cells","nt region","chimeric mRNAs","human \u03B1-globin coding region","reverse complementary sequence","decreased host protein synthesis concomitant","mRNA constructs","untranslated region","Nonviral mRNAs","mouse hepatitis virus","virus-induced factor","murine coronavirus","T7 expression vector","structural feature","capped transcripts","replacement","conjunction","A59 strain","start codon","contrast","UCUAAUCCAAACA","effect","data"],"language":"en"},

Both real and simulated data validated FastViromeExplorer as a reliable tool to accurately identify viruses and their abundances in large data, as well as in a time efficient manner.","publish_time":"2017-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tithi, Saima Sultana; Jensen, Roderick V.; Zhang, Liqing","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7964b9ecb8275ef892f2fe07f88391116d81281.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9b17a9fa6be11d8b3dbed9f3dea2516020083bd3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/196998","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phages","annotating viruses","data files","simulated data","large data","abundance quantification of viruses","FastViromeExplorer","big metagenomic data","metagenomics samples","rapid identification","rapid increase","expensive running time","time efficient manner","human health","important implication","viral outbreaks","generation sequencing","existing tools","stand-alone pipeline","reliable tool","personalized medicine","abundances","paper"],"language":"en"},

Healthcare systems around the world are trying to simultaneously treat patients with COVID-19 infection, prepare for its long-term impacts, and manage patients with other acute and chronic diseases. There are multiple ways that the COVID-19 pandemic will directly affect patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD), particularly given their common risk factors for poor outcomes. Major issues for patients with ILD will include restricted access to key components of the diagnostic process, new uncertainties in the use of common ILD pharmacotherapies, limited ability to monitor both disease severity and the presence of medication adverse effects, and significantly curtailed research activities. The purpose of this review is to summarize how COVID-19 has impacted key components of the diagnosis and management of fibrotic ILD as well as to provide strategies to mitigate these challenges. We further review major obstacles for researchers and identify priority areas for future ILD research related to COVID-19. Our goals are to provide practical considerations to support the care of patients with ILD during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide a road map for clinicians caring for these patients during future infectious disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Alyson W.; Fidler, Lee; Marcoux, Veronica; Johannson, Kerri A.; Assayag, Deborah; Fisher, Jolene H.; Hambly, Nathan; Kolb, Martin; Morisset, Julie; Shapera, Shane; Ryerson, Christopher J.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3eb68abc4260b18d82f9bc7854a8919c1914456a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333929/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001236922030756X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001236922030756X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","ILD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","care of patients","future ILD research","management of fibrotic ILD","pandemic","use of common ILD pharmacotherapies","disease severity","coronavirus disease","key components","future infectious disease outbreaks","fibrotic interstitial lung disease","review","major obstacles","Major issues","common risk factors","curtailed research activities","aspects of patient care","priority areas","limited ability","diagnostic process","new uncertainties","presence of medication adverse effects","restricted access","researchers","diagnosis","poor outcomes","clinicians","infection","practical considerations","road map","SARS-CoV","world","chronic diseases","long-term impacts","multiple ways","Healthcare systems","goals","strategies","challenges","purpose"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this review was to identify the potential risk of transmission associated with key interventions (chest compressions, defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to inform international treatment recommendations. Methods We undertook a systematic review comprising three questions: 1) aerosol generation associated with key interventions; 2) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions; and 3) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organisation COVID-19 database on 24th March 2020. Eligibility criteria were developed individually for each question. We assessed risk of bias for individual studies, and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty by outcome. Results We included eleven studies: two cohort studies, one case control study, five case reports, and three manikin randomised controlled trials. We did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection. Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery. Studies provided only indirect evidence, with no study describing patients with COVID-19. Evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes. Conclusion It is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers. There is very limited evidence and a rapid need for further studies.

Methods Regional (multi-ED) surveillance was established for 2 periods, one characterized by a high-profile national sports event and the other during an international disease outbreak. Counts of patient visits meeting syndrome criteria and total patient visits were reported daily on the secure regional emergency medicine Internet site and downloaded by public health staff. Trends were analyzed and displayed on the secure Web site. ED participants were surveyed about the acceptability and time cost of the project. Results In the first (\u201CAll Star Game\u201D) project, 8 departments reported daily counts for 4 weeks, covering more than 26,000 patient visits. In the second (\u201Csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201D [SARS]) project, an average of 11 departments in the same region reported daily data on febrile respiratory illnesses, travel, and contacts for 10 weeks. Experience with the first project allowed for rapid implementation of the second project during a 3-day period. In both instances, the surveillance efforts were undertaken without the need for extraordinary ED or public health staffing requirements. Conclusion A regional emergency medicine Internet approach permitted rapid implementation of multisite syndromic surveillance without additional staff. Some problems were identified with the first project, related to clinician checklist completion and manual data tabulation and entry. The SARS project addressed these by simplifying data collection and restricting it to triage.","publish_time":"2004-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foldy, Seth; Biedrzycki, Paul A.; Barthell, Edward N.; Healy-Haney, Nancy; Baker, Bevan K.; Howe, Donna S.; Gieryn, Douglas; Pemble, Kim R.","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d435bcdab8b1d94057f836ce8e4f2f7341e57bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118944.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064404000708; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064404000708","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS project","regional emergency medicine Internet approach","regional emergency medicine Internet application","secure regional emergency medicine Internet site","extraordinary ED","multi-ED","ED participants","daily data","Methods Regional","surveillance efforts","daily counts","total patient visits","public health staffing requirements","rapid implementation of multisite syndromic surveillance","utility of emergency department","patient visits meeting syndrome criteria","departments","data collection","weeks","manual data tabulation","secure Web site","severe acute respiratory syndrome","additional staff","febrile respiratory illnesses","impact","clinician checklist completion","feasibility","travel","need","acceptability","Conclusion","entry","contacts","high-profile national sports event","Abstract Study objective","time cost","average","Star Game","international disease outbreak","instances","periods","day period","Experience","problems","Trends","Results"],"language":"en"},

It begins with the release of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 from inflammatory cells. These cytokines induce fever, leucocytosis and release of serum acute phase proteins (APPs). In this review, the characteristics of the feline APR are described. In cats with inflammatory conditions, fever is a common finding, with leucocytosis due to the release of cells from the marginal pool, followed by activation of myelopoiesis. Because excitement frequently causes leucocytosis in cats, a diagnosis of inflammation should therefore be supported by additional findings such as the presence of toxic neutrophils. The major APPs are serum amyloid A and \u03B11-acid glycoprotein (AGP), which both increase a few hours after the inflammatory stimulus and remain elevated for as long as the inflammation persists. AGP plays an important role in the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and may also be useful also in studies of FIP pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paltrinieri, Saverio","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad612720a1d577f0dd05e7181a0350ea6cdb4f4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128355.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023307002110; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023307002110","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AGP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["leucocytosis","release of cells","inflammatory cells","release of serum acute phase proteins","fever","inflammatory conditions","release of interleukin","cats","inflammatory stimulus","diagnosis of inflammation","AGP","acute phase reaction","serum amyloid","diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis","major APPs","studies of FIP pathogenesis","TNF","\u03B11-acid glycoprotein","tumour necrosis factor","marginal pool","important role","common finding","response","presence of toxic neutrophils","additional findings","cytokines","activation of myelopoiesis","pathogenic stimuli","review","characteristics","hours","excitement"],"language":"en"},

The mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an evolutionary conserved circulating host defense protein that acts as a broad-spectrum recognition molecule against a wide variety of infectious agents. Target binding triggers the MBL pathway of complement activation. MBL can be considered conceptually as an \u2018ante-antibody\u2019 because it has a role in mammals during the lag period that is required to develop an antibody response against infectious agents. Additionally, there are MBL-like homologues in animals that lack adaptive immunity that activate a primitive complement system, and under these circumstances these MBL-like molecules play an analogous role to antibodies in higher animals. These molecules might be considered to be functional antecedents of antibodies. Recent work also indicates that MBL recognizes altered self-antigens, and as such MBL has a role that extends beyond a traditional role in first line host defense as it appears to play a role as a modulator of inflammation.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takahashi, Kazue; Ip, WK Eddie; Michelow, Ian C; Ezekowitz, R Alan B","journal":"Current Opinion in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b1be3227cddaf35d98b26bdb5aac5a11842bfc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126801.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952791505002074; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791505002074","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analogous role","traditional role","MBL pathway of complement activation","line host defense","effector molecules","infectious challenge","wide variety of infectious agents","primitive complement system","evolutionary conserved circulating host defense protein","higher animals","Target binding","antibody response","ante-antibody","broad-spectrum recognition molecule","sophisticated network of recognition","mannose-binding lectin","innate immune system","functional antecedents of antibodies","adaptive immunity","hours of exposure","homologues","altered self-antigens","circumstances","minutes","mammals","lag period","Recent work","modulator of inflammation"],"language":"en"},

Since then its hydrolytic machinery, including proteases and other hydrolases, has been fairly well identified and characterized. Among these are the cysteine cathepsins, members of the family of papain-like cysteine proteases. They have unique reactive-site properties and an uneven tissue-specific expression pattern. In living organisms their activity is a delicate balance of expression, targeting, zymogen activation, inhibition by protein inhibitors and degradation. The specificity of their substrate binding sites, small-molecule inhibitor repertoire and crystal structures are providing new tools for research and development. Their unique reactive-site properties have made it possible to confine the targets simply by the use of appropriate reactive groups. The epoxysuccinyls still dominate the field, but now nitriles seem to be the most appropriate \u201Cwarhead\u201D. The view of cysteine cathepsins as lysosomal proteases is changing as there is now clear evidence of their localization in other cellular compartments. Besides being involved in protein turnover, they build an important part of the endosomal antigen presentation. Together with the growing number of non-endosomal roles of cysteine cathepsins is growing also the knowledge of their involvement in diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, among others. Finally, cysteine cathepsins are important regulators and signaling molecules of an unimaginable number of biological processes. The current challenge is to identify their endogenous substrates, in order to gain an insight into the mechanisms of substrate degradation and processing. In this review, some of the remarkable advances that have taken place in the past decade are presented.

Using routine hospital data, we aimed to examine the spatial distribution, temporal trends and climatic risk factors of paediatric ARIs in Vietnam. METHODS: Data from hospitalised paediatric (\u003C16 years) patients with ARIs residing in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) between 2005 and 2010 were retrieved from the two main Children\u2019s Hospitals and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in HCMC. Spatial mapping and time series analysis were performed after disaggregating data into upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs). RESULTS: Over the study period, there were 155 999 paediatric patients admitted with ARIs (33% of all hospital admissions). There were 68 120 URIs (14%) and 87 879 LRIs (19%). The most common diagnoses were acute pharyngitis (28% of all ARI), pneumonia (21%), bronchitis (18%) and bronchiolitis (16%). A significant increasing trend over time was found for both URIs (mean weekly incidence per 1000 population, I=3.12), incidence rate ratio for 1-week increase in time (RR 1.0, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17) for URI and (I=4.02, RR 1.08 (95% CI 1.006 to 1.16)) for LRI. The weekly URI incidence peaked in May\u2013June and was significantly associated with lags in weekly URI incidence and the average humidity, rainfall and water level. The weekly LRI incidence exhibited significant seasonality (P\u003C0.0001), with an annual peak in September\u2013October and was significantly associated with lags in weekly LRI incidence and lags in weekly average temperature, rainfall and water level. CONCLUSIONS: ARIs are a leading cause of childhood hospitalisation in HCMC, Vietnam. The incidence of ARIs was higher in the wet season and in specific HCMC districts. These results may guide health authorities in where and when to effectively allocate resources for the prevention and control of ARIs.","publish_time":"2018-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Nhan Thi; Thompson, Corinne; Nhan, Le Nguyen Thanh; Van, Hoang Minh Tu; Dung, Nguyen Thanh; Tran My, Phuc; Quang, Vo Minh; Minh, Ngo Ngoc Quang; Tuan, Tran Anh; Hung, Nguyen Thanh; Tuan, Ha Manh; Vinh Chau, Nguyen Van; Wolbers, Marcel; Thwaites, Guy E; Choisy, Marc; Baker, Stephen","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e50c8a016885a30fcf67cee1b1e70c56b5c27e2a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2975cca0a160177ac01195442ee8f6a55c59bd24.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5fa442d7a4a81f82d7c5f0ecc72ab708ac2a7266.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780701.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29358416/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016349","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARIs"],"organizations":["URI","LRI"],"locations":["Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["incidence of ARIs","weekly incidence","weekly LRI incidence","weekly URI incidence","control of ARIs","weekly average temperature","lags","incidence rate ratio","URIs","Acute respiratory tract infections","climatic risk factors of paediatric ARIs","lower respiratory tract infections","upper respiratory tract infections","paediatric patients","routine hospital data","rainfall","water level","specific HCMC districts","Vietnam","hospital admissions","RESULTS","RR","LRIs","leading cause of morbidity","time series analysis","average humidity","leading cause of childhood hospitalisation","spatial distribution","significant seasonality","Spatial mapping","acute pharyngitis","significant increasing trend","young children","temporal trends","mortality","wet season","Ho Chi Minh City","Tropical Diseases","middle-income countries","main Children\u2019s Hospitals","years","BACKGROUND","study period","common diagnoses","prevention","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","bronchitis","pneumonia","resources","health authorities","population","annual peak","bronchiolitis"],"language":"en"},

The present study describes the mode of action of trypsin in enhancing PEDV infection in Vero cells during different stage of the virus life cycle. During the viral entry stage, trypsin increased the penetration of Vero-cell-attached PEDV by approximately twofold. However, trypsin treatment of viruses before receptor binding did not enhance infectivity, indicating that receptor binding is essentially required for trypsin-mediated entry upon PEDV infection. Trypsin treatment during the budding stage of virus infection induces an obvious cytopathic effect in infected cells. Furthermore, we also show that the PEDV spike (S) glycoprotein is cleaved by trypsin in virions that are bound to the receptor, but not in free virions. These findings indicate that trypsin affects only cell-attached PEDV and increases infectivity and syncytium formation in PEDV-infected Vero cells by cleavage of the PEDV S protein. These findings strongly suggest that the PEDV S protein may undergo a conformational change after receptor binding and cleavage by exogenous trypsin, which induces membrane fusion.","publish_time":"2011-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Jung-Eun; Cruz, Deu John M.; Shin, Hyun-Jin","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2392ff75d2947e71b5d465a61fb2cd6247d4b67e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087168.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21667287/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-011-1044-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infection","PEDV spike","exogenous trypsin","PEDV-infected Vero cells","PEDV S protein","trypsin treatment of viruses","trypsin-mediated entry","receptor binding","infected cells","budding stage of virus infection","penetration of Vero","cleavage","different stage","viral entry stage","infectivity","findings","virus life cycle","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","free virions","conformational change","syncytium formation","obvious cytopathic effect","mode of action","glycoprotein","present study","membrane fusion","undefined mechanism"],"language":"en"},

At least one positive sample was detected on 74 of the farms (92.5%) by IFAT microscopy. The prevalence in cattle was 10.2% (95% CI 9.4\u201311.1%), with greater prevalences detected in calf samples, especially from those under 1 month (45.1%). Young calves were also more likely to be shedding Cryptosporidium parvum and larger concentrations of oocysts, whereas older calves and adult cattle were more likely to be shedding Cryptosporidium bovis and Cryptosporidium andersoni, respectively. The C. parvum subtypes detected were predominantly from types commonly identified in UK cattle (67% were either IIaA15G2R1 or IIaA17G1R1). A novel subtype, IIaA17G1R2, was identified from one cattle sample. The prevalence in co-grazed sheep was low (4%). Birds and rodents may represent significant reservoirs of Cryptosporidium due to high prevalence, large oocyst concentrations, and the detection of a C. parvum subtype known to be present in human populations, identified in samples from these wildlife. Cryptosporidium were detected in dirty water and manure, and also from pasture samples where slurry had been spread. On 64% of the farms, identical Cryptosporidium species were detected (mainly C. parvum or C. bovis) from different cattle groups on the farms, although no direct or indirect contact between the groups were recorded, apart from sharing staff. The same Cryptosporidium species were found in cattle, farm wastes and bird samples on the same farms, but rarely, or not at all, present in sheep or rodent samples. The matching of species/subtypes was also related to the proximity of the different sample sources which may indicate a potential transmission route.","publish_time":"2014-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, R.

In water-borne outbreaks, the connection between poor microbial water quality and disease can be quickly identified. The impact of non-compliant drinking water samples due to E. coli taken for regular monitoring on the incidence of notified acute gastrointestinal infections has not yet been studied. METHODS: The objective of this study was to analyse the geographical distribution of notified acute gastrointestinal infections (AGI) in Slovenia in 2010, with hotspot identification. The second aim of the study was to correlate the fecal contamination of water supply system on the settlement level with the distribution of notified AGI cases. Spatial analysis using geo-information technology and other methods were used. RESULTS: Hot spots with the highest proportion of notified AGI cases were mainly identified in areas with small supply zones. The risk for getting AGI was drinking water contaminated with E. coli from supply zones with 50\u20131000 users: RR was 1.25 and significantly greater than one (p-value less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed the correlation between the frequency of notified AGI cases and non-compliant results in drinking water monitoring.","publish_time":"2015-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"GRILC, Eva; GALE, Ivanka; VER\u0160I\u010C, Ale\u0161; \u017DAGAR, Tina; SO\u010CAN, Maja","journal":"Zdr Varst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ed5058204d1330e780f20fca2694bc0fd20d329.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4820156.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646727/; https://doi.org/10.1515/sjph-2015-0028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["AGI"],"locations":["Slovenia"],"keyphrases":["drinking water monitoring","distribution of notified AGI cases","frequency of notified AGI cases","highest proportion of notified AGI cases","fecal contamination of water supply system","study","impact of non-compliant drinking water samples","brief episodes of fecal contamination of drinking water","poor microbial water quality","incidence of notified acute gastrointestinal infections","geographical distribution of notified acute gastrointestinal infections","non-compliant results","coli","small supply zones","METHODS","regular monitoring","settlement level","connection","geo-information technology","Slovenia","correlation","areas","Hot spots","Spatial analysis","disease","outbreaks","INTRODUCTION","users","illness","p-value","hotspot identification","CONCLUSION","objective","risk","consumers","aim"],"language":"en"},

New kinds of biological weapons which fall outside of traditional Cold War era thinking can be created synthetically using genetic code.

We investigate here the role of a 3-3-1 hydrophobic repeat containing nonpolar amino acids at the a, d, and g positions in determining the structures of coiled coils using mutants of the GCN4 leucine zipper dimerization domain. When three charged residues at the g positions in the parental sequence are replaced by nonpolar alanine or valine side chains, stable four-helix structures result. The X-ray crystal structures of the tetramers reveal antiparallel, four-stranded coiled coils in which the a, d, and g side chains interlock in a combination of knobs-into-knobs and knobs-into-holes packing. Interfacial interactions in a coiled coil can therefore be prescribed by hydrophobic-polar patterns beyond the canonical 3-4 heptad repeat. The results suggest that the conserved, charged residues at the g positions in the GCN4 leucine zipper can impart a negative design element to disfavor thermodynamically more stable, antiparallel tetramers.","publish_time":"2006-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Yiqun; Liu, Jie; Zheng, Qi; Eliezer, David; Kallenbach, Neville R.; Lu, Min","journal":"Structure","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18fce7553c78f84d21e05f8a2e0ea556e60189a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126439.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212606000463; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969212606000463","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["g positions","structures of coiled coils","hydrophobic repeat","chains interlock","nonpolar alanine","nonpolar amino acids","combination of knobs","amino acid repeat","antiparallel tetramers","heptad repeat","charged residues","X-ray crystal structures","helix structures result","GCN4 leucine zipper dimerization domain","coil sequences","hydrophobic-polar patterns","mutants","parental sequence","negative design element","proteins","valine","Summary","Interfacial interactions","holes packing","results","role"],"language":"en"},

A model of uncertain reasoning based on a form of logical argumentation appears to unify many diverse ideas.

To date, only a few reports of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis secondary to the H1N1 virus have been published.","publish_time":"2012-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6zkale, Yasemin; Erol, Ilknur; \u00D6zkale, Murat; Demir, \u015Eenay; Alehan, F\u00FCsun","journal":"Pediatr Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19952da63c90a701ae0ded9a46a4ff54267293a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127454.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2012.03.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887899412001579; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887899412001579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22704021/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis","H1N1 virus","reports of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis secondary","febrile respiratory signs","upper respiratory tract infection","fever","white matter","inflammatory disorder","central nervous system","spinal cord","frequencies of severe complications","influenza","self-limited course","brain","cough","sore throat","death","demyelination","date"],"language":"en"},

All virus strains were resistant to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine), but susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) (oseltamivir and zanamivir). One strain (A/shanghai/1/2013) contained the R294K substitution in the neuraminidase (NA) gene, indicating resistance to oseltamivir. Pyrosequencing has proven to be a useful tool in the surveillance of drug resistance in influenza A viruses. Here, we describe a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay coupled with pyrosequencing to identify the NA residues E120, H276, and R294 (N9 numbering) of H7N9 viruses. A total of 43 specimens (26 clinical samples and 17 isolates) were tested. Only one isolate containing the E120V heterogenic mutation was detected by pyrosequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. However, this mutation was not detected in the original clinical specimen. Since virus isolation might lead to the selection of variants that might not fully represent the virus population in the clinical specimens, we suggest that using pyrosequencing to detect NAI resistance in H7N9 viruses directly from clinical specimens rather than from cultured isolates. No cross-reactions with other types of influenza virus and respiratory tract viruses were found, and this assay has a sensitivity of 100 copies of synthetic RNA for all three codons. The high sensitivity and specificity of the assay should be sufficient for the detection of positive clinical specimens. In this study, we provide a rapid and reliable method for the characterization of NAI resistance in H7N9 viruses.","publish_time":"2014-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Yuhua; Fan, Huan; Qi, Xian; Zhu, Zheng; Guo, Xiling; Chen, Yin; Ge, Yiyue; Zhao, Kangchen; Wu, Tao; Li, Yan; Shan, Yunfeng; Zhou, Minghao; Shi, Zhiyang; Wang, Hua; Cui, Lunbiao","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef6d7a0388ffb5da9be98050ccc242315fac44a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126809.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213003730; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213003730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24211668/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.10.026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["NA","NAI"],"locations":["Eastern China"],"keyphrases":["H7N9 viruses","Pyrosequencing","types of influenza virus","virus strains","virus population","virus isolation","clinical samples","detection of positive clinical specimens","characterization of NAI resistance","respiratory tract viruses","original clinical specimen","surveillance of drug resistance","PCR assay","oseltamivir","novel reassortant avian influenza","neuraminidase inhibitors","high sensitivity","cultured isolates","NA residues E120","E120V heterogenic mutation","H276","amantadine","rimantadine","NAIs","adamantanes","humans","N9 numbering","reliable method","copies of synthetic RNA","useful tool","specificity","gene","reverse transcription","Eastern China","cross-reactions","R294K substitution","codons","zanamivir","selection of variants","Sanger sequencing","total","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Prior to analysis, plasma was fractionated using ethanol precipitation. Using two dimensional SDS-PAGE; fractionated protein profiles of 20 healthy and 20 exposed patients with lung diseases were established. Selected protein spots were successfully identified with MALDI TOF MS/MS. RESULTS: The results show that \u03B11 haptoglobin isoforms were detected in plasma of the all lung disease patients but none of the healthy controls. Amyloid A1 isoforms was also detected in plasma of the lung disease patients but none of the healthy controls. Moreover, low molecular weight proteins were enriched in ethanol supernatant compared to ethanol precipitate. CONCLUSION: Our present results and previous studies suggest that ongoing tissue remodeling is involved in SM exposed lung damage patients.

It is established that plants harbour microorganisms, collectively known as endophytes. Exploring the as-yet untapped natural products from the endophytes increases the chances of finding novel compounds. The concept of natural products targeting microbial pathogens has been applied to isolate novel antimycobacterial compounds, and the rapid development of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis has significantly increased the need for new treatments against this pathogen. It remains important to continuously screen for novel compounds from natural sources, particularly from rarely encountered microorganisms, such as the endophytes. This review focuses on bioprospecting for polyketides and small peptides exhibiting antituberculosis activity, although current treatments against tuberculosis are described. It is established that natural products from these structure classes are often biosynthesised by microorganisms. Therefore it is hypothesised that some bioactive polyketides and peptides originally isolated from plants are in fact produced by their endophytes.

The manner in which multiple pathogens interact is not always straightforward, however. Bordetella bronchiseptica and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) are respiratory pathogens of pigs whose relatives, B. pertussis and the SARS virus, cause respiratory disease in humans. In an initial experiment, the effect of coinfection of PRCV and B. bronchiseptica was examined in thirty, 4-week-old pigs (10 pigs/group) that were infected with either PRCV or B. bronchiseptica, or both PRCV and B. bronchiseptica. An additional 10 pigs served as sham infected controls. Five pigs from each group were euthanized at 4 and 10 days post-infection. Gross and histopathological lung lesions were more severe in the coinfected group as compared to the groups infected with B. bronchiseptica or PRCV alone. In order to investigate the potential role of proinflammatory cytokines in disease severity after coinfection, a second experiment was performed to examine cytokine transcription in alveolar macrophages from single and dually infected pigs. A total of 48 pigs were divided equally into groups as above, but 4 pigs from each group were euthanized at 1, 4 and 10 days post-infection. Coinfected pigs showed a greater and more sustained transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 and MCP-1, than pigs infected with either PRCV or B. bronchiseptica alone. Thus, there appears to be a synergistic effect between PRCV and B. bronchiseptica with regards to proinflammatory cytokine transcription that may partially explain the increased severity of pneumonia in coinfected pigs.","publish_time":"2008-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brockmeier, S.

Thus, they will never reach the cell nucleus or the perinuclear areas where replication or reverse transcription usually takes place. It has been proposed that many unrelated viruses are transported along microtubules in a retrograde manner using the cellular dynein machinery or, at least, some dynein components. A putative employment of the dynein motor in a dynein\u2010mediated transport has been suggested from experiments in which viral capsid proteins were used as bait in yeast two\u2010hybrid screens using libraries composed of cellular proteins and dynein\u2010associated chains were retrieved as virus\u2010interacting proteins. In most cases DYNLL1, DYNLT1 or DYNLRB1 were identified as the dynein chains that interact with viral proteins. The importance of these dynein\u2013virus interactions has been supported, in principle, by the observation that in some cases the dynein\u2010interacting motifs of viral proteins altered by site\u2010directed mutagenesis result in non\u2010infective virions. Furthermore, overexpression of p50 dynamitin, which blocks the dynein\u2013dynactin interaction, or incubation of infected cells with peptides that compete with viral polypeptides for dynein binding have been shown to alter the viral retrograde transport. Still, it remains to be proved that dynein light chains can bind simultaneously to incoming virions and to the dynein motor for retrograde transport to take place. In this review, we will analyse the association of viral proteins with dynein polypeptides and its implications for viral infection.","publish_time":"2011-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Merino\u2010Gracia, Javier; Garc\u00EDa\u2010Mayoral, Mar\u00EDa F.; Rodr\u00EDguez\u2010Crespo, Ignacio","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f5e10ffa1e08bc2b6ccda9a0c7e182306b0befb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164101.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08252.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21777384/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dynein chains","dynein motor","dynein polypeptides","dynein binding","dynein components","cellular dynein machinery","dynein light chains","viral polypeptides","association of viral proteins","motifs of viral proteins","viral capsid proteins","viral retrograde transport","cellular proteins","viral particles","viral infection","associated chains","retrograde manner","mediated transport","place","cellular plasma membrane","incoming virions","virus interactions","cases DYNLL1","non\u2010infective virions","perinuclear areas","replication","endosomal membranes","bait","site","libraries","mutagenesis result","hybrid screens","incubation of infected cells","reverse transcription","yeast","DYNLRB1","experiments","implications","dynactin interaction","microtubules","cell nucleus","DYNLT1","fusion","observation","importance","putative employment","overexpression of p50 dynamitin","crowded cytoplasm environment","unrelated viruses","principle","review"],"language":"en"},

The objective was to estimate the economic benefit of participation in the AJDI. A decision tree was constructed in which disease prevalence, test characteristics, and probabilities for implementation of best management practices suggested by herd veterinarians were implemented. Analysis was performed using a Markov analysis, and input data were assigned using estimates from the AJDI and published data. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed and the net benefit of participation (from the perspective of a dairy farmer) in the AJDI compared with no participation was calculated. A series of 1-way sensitivity analyses were used to control for uncertainty. Farms participating in the AJDI were estimated to have a net benefit of Can$74 per cow over the course of 10yr. If project costs were covered by the participating farm, the net benefit was Can$27. In addition to the effects on MAP infection, a reduction in calf diarrhea was modeled for farms that improved their calf management through the use of pasteurizers. In that case, the additional costs outweighed additional revenues compared with the baseline analysis, resulting in a reduced net benefit of Can$19. Participation would not be cost effective if cows in early stages of MAP infection did not have decreased production and if prevalence of MAP infection did not increase on farms with poor management. A limitation of the study, despite high uncertainty in some input parameters, was the lack of knowledge regarding changes in prevalence on farms with various management strategies. In conclusion, participation in the AJDI was cost effective for the average Alberta dairy farm.","publish_time":"2014-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolf, R.; Clement, F.; Barkema, H.

This study aimed to characterise the antimicrobial resistance patterns, molecular subtypes, and integron types and resistance gene cassettes in S. sonnei from Jiangsu Province, China. METHODS: In total, 340 S. sonnei were collected in 2002\u20132011 throughout Jiangsu Province. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), PCR amplification of integrons, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing of cassette regions were performed. RESULTS: Resistance rates to ampicillin (67.7%), nalidixic acid (75.2%), tetracycline (73.7%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (68.7%) remained high. Strains from Centre and South Jiangsu showed higher resistance and multiresistance rates compared with the North. PFGE analysis indicated that large-scale clonal transmission among different cities occurred several times during 10 years. Among all strains, 55.9% (190/340) harboured class 1 integrons, 80.3% (273/340) harboured class 2 integrons and 49.4% (168/340) harboured an atypical class 1 integron. Resistance rates to nine antimicrobials in the class 1 integron-positive group were significantly higher than in the negative group (P \u003C 0.05). Seven different gene cassettes were detected in class 1 integrons. The most prevalent type was aacA4\u2013cmlA1 (114/286). Class 2 integrons carried the gene cassette array dfrA1\u2013sat1\u2013aadA1, and the atypical class 1 integron carried bla(OXA-30)\u2013aadA1. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing antimicrobial resistance and significant clonal transmission of S. sonnei circulating in Jiangsu were closely related to the high prevalence of integrons and gene cassettes. Long-term cross-regional monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is urgently required for S. sonnei.","publish_time":"2017-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Bing; Xu, Ting; Kang, Haiquan; Xu, Yanling; Liu, Genyan; Pan, Shiyang; Qian, Huimin; Ma, Ping","journal":"J Glob Antimicrob Resist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f43b3d3fa582e9990f290c0ddf7696503f3e46a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103933.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213716517300747; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213716517300747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28606485/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2017.03.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. sonnei"],"organizations":["Centre and South Jiangsu","PFGE"],"locations":["Jiangsu","China"],"keyphrases":["harboured class","resistance gene cassettes","higher resistance","atypical class","increasing antimicrobial resistance","antimicrobial resistance patterns","different gene cassettes","high prevalence of integrons","Jiangsu Province","PCR amplification of integrons","Long-term cross-regional monitoring of antimicrobial resistance","integron types","South Jiangsu","resistant Shigella sonnei","integron-positive group","gene cassette array dfrA1","Antimicrobial susceptibility testing","multiresistance rates","aadA1","Strains","large-scale clonal transmission","significant clonal transmission","PFGE analysis","different cities","negative group","DNA sequencing of cassette regions","RFLP","restriction fragment length polymorphism","molecular subtypes","field gel electrophoresis","sat1","rapid emergence of drug","serious public health problem","Centre","times","ampicillin","bla","antimicrobials","prevalent type","aacA4","cmlA1","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","China","tetracycline","trimethoprim","nalidixic acid","years","sulfamethoxazole","North","total","study","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we demonstrated that the infection of SARS-CoV and a pseudovirus bearing the S protein of SARS-CoV was inhibited by a protease inhibitor Ben-HCl. Also, the protease Factor Xa, a target of Ben-HCl abundantly expressed in infected cells, was able to cleave the recombinant and pseudoviral S protein into S1 and S2 subunits, and the cleavage was inhibited by Ben-HCl. Furthermore, this cleavage correlated with the infectivity of the pseudovirus.

However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats\u2019 age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters. RESULTS: In the multivariable random intercept model, the odds of FIV compared to FeLV positive ELISA results were greater for adults (OR = 2.09, CI: 1.50-2.92), intact males (OR = 3.14, CI: 1.85-3.76), neutered males (OR = 2.68, CI: 1.44- 3.14), cats with outdoor access (OR = 2.58, CI: 1.85-3.76) and lower for cats with clinical illness (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.90). The variance components obtained from the model indicated clustering at the testing facility level. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors that have a greater effect on FIV seropositivity include adulthood, being male (neutered or not) and having access to outdoors, while clinical illness was a stronger predictor for FeLV seropositivity. Further studies are warranted to assess the implications of these results for the management and control of these infections.","publish_time":"2015-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chhetri, Bimal K; Berke, Olaf; Pearl, David L; Bienzle, Dorothee","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72e37ddb3310bf50385723819244148ab9a787f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4332748.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889006/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0339-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIV"],"locations":["United States","Canada"],"keyphrases":["FIV seropositivity","FIV infection","FeLV seropositivity","FeLV infections","odds of FIV","IDEXX FIV","cats seropositive","similar risk factors","reported risk factors","effect of known risk factors","infected cats","FeLV ELISA kits","FeLV positive ELISA results","type of testing facility","testing facility level","testing practices","greater effect","stronger effect","multivariable random intercept model","case-case study design","clustering","clinical illness","retrospective study","outdoor access","neutered males","random intercept logistic regression models","Feline immunodeficiency virus","feline leukemia virus","health status","neuter status","similar recommendations","outdoor exposure","stronger predictor","intact males","cross sectional studies","cats\u2019 age","sex","literature","regard","adults","adulthood","account","samples","United States","individual clinics","management","independent variables","BACKGROUND","shelters","implications","control","Canada","contrasting evidence","variance components","Data","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Among these proteins, the multifunctional viral protein \u03B334.5 crucially interferes with or disrupts several antiviral pathways at multiple levels. The current study shows that \u03B334.5 utilizes nucleolar protein NOP53 to facilitate the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2\u03B1 for efficient viral translation. Our study shows that: (1) ectopic expression of NOP53 greatly increases the intracellular and extracellular viral yields of HSV-1 (wild strain F) in type I interferon-deficient Vero cells, and more subtly promotes viral replication of \u03B334.5 deletion mutant virus HSV-1/\u0394\u03B334.5. (2) NOP53 is migrated from nuclei in HSV-1/F infected cells, but is redistributed incompletely after infection by either HSV-1/\u0394\u03B334.5 or ICP4 deletion mutant virus HSV-1/d120 (replication inadequate). Ectopic expression of \u03B334.5, consequently, induces cytoplasmic translocation of NOP53 in response to HSV-1/\u0394\u03B334.5 infection. (3) Increase of NOP53, in two forms of transient transfection and in vitro expression, attenuates the phosphorylation level of eIF2\u03B1 in HSV-1/F infected cells, but fails to affect eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation induced by HSV-1/\u0394\u03B334.5 infection. (4) Knockdown of NOP53, which impairs the specific interaction between \u03B334.5 and protein phosphatase PP1\u03B1, disrupts the ability of \u03B334.5 to maintain HSV-1 virulence. (5) NOP53 knockdown also significantly reduces tissue damage and decreases viral yield in livers of HSV-1 infected mice. Our findings expand the understanding of the underlying mechanism by which viral protein \u03B334.5 induces NOP53 redistribution; cytoplasmic NOP53 facilitates \u03B334.5 recruitment of PP1\u03B1 to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03B1, for optimal viral replication. This paper also demonstrates that blocking the specific interaction between \u03B334.5 and PP1\u03B1 would be a useful approach for the development of antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2018-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, Wen; Han, Shi-Chong; Li, Cui-Cui; Dong, Hui-Jun; Wang, Xiao-Jia","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19758fc382a2921a000c9d85a33300d3e3b0e2b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5833762.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29367603/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-017-0116-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral replication of \u03B334","livers of HSV","multifunctional viral protein \u03B334","cytoplasmic NOP53","Knockdown of NOP53","NOP53 knockdown","extracellular viral yields of HSV","viral proteins","ability of \u03B334","NOP53 redistribution","Increase of NOP53","nucleolar protein NOP53","Ectopic expression of \u03B334","ectopic expression of NOP53","optimal viral replication","ICP4 deletion mutant virus HSV","cytoplasmic translocation of NOP53","\u0394\u03B334","infection","efficient viral translation","efficient virus replication","eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","F infected cells","protein phosphatase PP1\u03B1","replication inadequate","phosphorylation level of eIF2\u03B1","herpes simplex virus type","recruitment of PP1\u03B1","specific interaction","infected mice","wild strain F","dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2\u03B1","interferon-deficient Vero cells","antiviral pathways","current study","development of antiviral agents","counter host defense response","tissue damage","underlying mechanism","d120","useful approach","forms of transient transfection","understanding","multiple levels","nuclei","findings","paper","virulence"],"language":"en"},

We found that CSFV infection increased the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)2\u03B1 and its kinase PKR. However, the expression of viral proteins continued to increase. Furthermore, PKR overexpression enhanced CSFV replication, while PKR inhibition resulted in reduced CSFV replication and an increase in interferon (IFN) induction. In addition, PKR was responsible for eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation in CSFV-infected cells. These results suggest that the activation of PKR during CSFV infection is beneficial to the virus.

Some of these host proteins are enclosed within the virion structure, while others, in the case of enveloped viruses, are embedded in the host-derived membrane. While many of these host protein incorporations are likely accidental, some may play a role in virus infectivity, replication and/or immunoreactivity in the next host. Host protein incorporations may be especially important in therapeutic applications where large numbers of virus particles are administered. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is the prototypic rhabdovirus and a candidate vaccine, gene therapy and oncolytic vector. Using mass spectrometry, we previously examined cell type dependent host protein content of VSV virions using intact (\u201Cwhole\u201D) virions purified from three cell lines originating from different species. Here we aimed to determine the localization of host proteins within the VSV virions by analyzing: i) whole VSV virions; and ii) whole VSV virions treated with Proteinase K to remove all proteins outside the viral envelope. A total of 257 proteins were identified, with 181 identified in whole virions and 183 identified in Proteinase K treated virions. Most of these proteins have not been previously shown to be associated with VSV. Functional enrichment analysis indicated the most overrepresented categories were proteins associated with vesicles, vesicle-mediated transport and protein localization. Using western blotting, the presence of several host proteins, including some not previously shown in association with VSV (such as Yes1, Prl1 and Ddx3y), was confirmed and their relative quantities in various virion fractions determined. Our study provides a valuable inventory of virion-associated host proteins for further investigation of their roles in the replication cycle, pathogenesis and immunoreactivity of VSV.","publish_time":"2014-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moerdyk-Schauwecker, Megan; Hwang, Sun-Il; Grdzelishvili, Valery Z.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/167b459cba8933f49d8cb5585f442a68fe326361.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4126742.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25105980/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0104688","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV","Proteinase K"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated host proteins","localization of host proteins","encoded proteins","host protein incorporations","immunoreactivity of VSV","examined cell type dependent host protein content of VSV virions","host-derived membrane","protein localization","virus infectivity","Vesicular stomatitis virus","large numbers of virus particles","virion structure","Proteinase","valuable inventory of virion","various virion fractions","cell lines","replication cycle","candidate vaccine","vesicles","therapeutic applications","gene therapy","overrepresented categories","vesicle-mediated transport","prototypic rhabdovirus","roles","pathogenesis","investigation","oncolytic vector","relative quantities","Yes1","presence","Functional enrichment analysis","mass spectrometry","different species","study","Prl1","western blotting","case of enveloped viruses","Ddx3y","association","viral envelope","total"],"language":"en"},

In 2007, the first canine norovirus (CNV) was identified and characterized in Italy. Subsequent studies have identified CNV in stools of dogs from Portugal, Greece, and the United States. To investigate the prevalence of CNV in the UK dog population, 228 canine stool samples were screened for CNV by qPCR, and 396 serum samples were screened for anti-CNV antibodies. qPCR of RNA extracted from canine stool samples did not reveal any CNV-positive samples, based on samples collected from diarrhoeic and control dogs in 2012\u20132013. CNV virus-like particles to three different CNV strains were produced using recombinant baculoviruses and a seroprevalence screen undertaken. Anti-CNV antibodies were identified at significant levels in canine serum; 38.1% of samples collected between 1999\u20132001 and 60.1% of samples collected in 2012\u20132013 were seropositive. The increase in seroprevalence over time (p\u003C0.001) suggests that the CNV strains screened for are becoming more widespread. Variation in seroprevalence to different CNV strains was also identified. Two-thirds of the dogs were seropositive to a single strain, whereas the remaining third were seropositive to two or three of the strains analysed. This study has provided the first evidence that CNV is present in the UK, with seroprevalence identified to multiple circulating strains. This warrants further study and increased awareness of this recently discovered canine virus.","publish_time":"2013-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caddy, Sarah; Emmott, Edward; El-Attar, Laila; Mitchell, Judy; de Rougemont, Alexis; Brownlie, Joe; Goodfellow, Ian","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f53604d28e212733384d7ec28e84d4a62e506254.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3855277.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24339947/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0081596","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNV","UK","RNA"],"locations":["Greece","United States"],"keyphrases":["CNV virus","CNV-positive samples","prevalence of CNV","different CNV strains","anti-CNV antibodies","canine stool samples","serum samples","canine serum","canine virus","canine norovirus","seroprevalence screen","stools of dogs","control dogs","multiple circulating strains","study","qPCR of RNA","UK dog population","recombinant baculoviruses","significant levels","humans","cows","Greece","Portugal","particles","intestinal disease","increased awareness","pigs","single strain","Variation","mice","warrants","time","Subsequent studies","evidence","United States","Noroviruses","thirds","Italy"],"language":"en"},

Strong empirical evidence is found that unemployment as a side effect of the Open Door Policy, and the deregulation of SOE and collective enterprises were the main causes for the decreasing trend. For example, urban areas that were highly affected by the Open Door Policy were associated with 17 percentage points decrease in the insurance coverage. Moreover, I found evidence that the gaps between SOE and non-SOE employees, collective and non-collective employees, urban and rural employees have considerably decreased during the ten years.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Juan","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49cc1908e7527a90bfb01d2f05bf16cb9a57a12f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116972.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953609002949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19520475/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.05.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953609002949","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SOE","GLS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["collective enterprises","non-collective employees","coverage of public health insurance","non-SOE employees","changing pattern of health insurance coverage","fixed effects logit model","rural employees","Health Survey","random effects GLS model","fixed effects linear model clustering","deregulation of SOE","effects of specific policies","China Nutrition","Open Door Policy","Chinese state-owned enterprises","transitional period of China","urban areas","Strong empirical evidence","pooled OLS","panel data","SOEs","reforms","province level","main causes","gaps","alternative models","percentage points","unemployment","results","estimation","decreasing trend","paper","Abstract","example","attempt","literature","years"],"language":"en"},

In this article, we review old and new literature about the functions of the three domains. Much progress in recent years has contributed to a picture of nsP3, particularly through its HVD as a hub for interactions with host cell molecules, with multiple effects on the biology of the host cell at early points in infection.

Here we show that this type of interference can be observed in individuals after immunization with recombinant E1E2 proteins. One hundred and twelve blinded serum samples from a Phase I, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial using recombinant HCV E1E2 with MF59C.1 adjuvant in healthy HCV-negative adults were tested in ELISA for binding reactivity to peptides representing the E2 regions 412\u2013426 (EP-I) and 434\u2013446 (EP-II). All samples were subsequently tested for neutralizing activity using HCVcc 1a(H77)/2a chimera, HCVpp H77 and HCVpp HCV-1 after treatment to remove EP-II-specific antibodies or mock treatment with a control peptide. Among the 112 serum samples we found 22 double positive (EP-I and EP-II), 6 EP-II positive only, 14 EP-I positive only and 70 double negative. Depleting EP-II antibodies from double positive serum samples increased ID(50) neutralizing antibody titers (up to 4.9-fold) in up to 72% of samples (p\u22640.0005) contrasting with ID(50) neutralization titer increases in 2 of 70 double negative samples (2.9%) (p\u003E0.5). In addition, EP-I-specific antibody levels in serum samples showed a significant correlation with ID(50) neutralization titers when EP-II antibodies were removed (p\u003C0.0003). CONCLUSION: These data show that antibodies to the region 434\u2013446 are induced during immunization of individuals with recombinant E1E2 proteins and that these antibodies can mask effective neutralizing activity from EP-I-specific antibodies. Elicitation of EP-II-specific antibodies with interfering capacity should be avoided in producing an effective cross-neutralizing vaccine aimed at the HCV envelope proteins.","publish_time":"2015-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kachko, Alla; Frey, Sharon E.; Sirota, Lev; Ray, Ranjit; Wells, Frances; Zubkova, Iryna; Zhang, Pei; Major, Marian E.","journal":"Hepatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6565f5a0d6c858411d2c234fc1aaa0deb8cad13c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4681649.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.28108; https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/hep.28108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26251214/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Depleting EP","Elicitation of EP","specific antibodies","double positive serum samples","double negative samples","blinded serum samples","recombinant HCV E1E2","HCVpp HCV","recombinant E1E2 proteins","HCV envelope proteins","specific antibody levels","effective neutralizing activity","healthy HCV-negative adults","neutralization titers","antibody titers","immunization of individuals","HCVpp H77","E2 regions","phenomenon of so-called antibody interference","mock treatment","type of interference","adjuvant","MF59C","dose escalation trial","vaccinated chimpanzees","infected patients","ELISA","peptides","binding reactivity","placebo","vaccine","chimera","significant correlation","Hepatitis C virus","Phase","control peptide","HCVcc","data","interfering capacity","CONCLUSION","addition","fold"],"language":"en"},

Infodemiology metrics have been widely and successfully used to assess and forecast epidemics and outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: In light of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan, China in 2019, online search traffic data from Google are used to track the spread of the new coronavirus disease in Europe. METHODS: Time series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of \u201CCoronavirus\u201D were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide and in the European countries that have been affected the most: Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations are observed between online interest and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Furthermore, a critical point, after which the Pearson correlation coefficient starts declining (even if it is still statistically significant) was identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries that have not yet peaked in COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In the past, infodemiology metrics in general and data from Google Trends in particular have been shown to be useful in tracking and forecasting outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics as, for example, in the cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, measles, and Zika.

Early detection of canine parvovirus (CPV-2) is crucial to initiating appropriate outbreak control strategies. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), a novel isothermal gene amplification technique, has been developed for the molecular detection of diverse pathogens. In this study, a real-time RPA assay was developed for the detection of CPV-2 using primers and an exo probe targeting the CPV-2 nucleocapsid protein gene. RESULTS: The real-time RPA assay was performed successfully at 38 \u00B0C, and the results were obtained within 4\u201312 min for 10(5)\u201310(1) molecules of template DNA. The assay only detected CPV-2, and did not show cross-detection of other viral pathogens, demonstrating a high level of specificity. The analytical sensitivity of the real-time RPA was 10(1) copies/reaction of a standard DNA template, which was 10 times more sensitive than the common RPA method. The clinical sensitivity of the real-time RPA assay matched 100% (n = 91) to the real-time PCR results. CONCLUSION: The real-time RPA assay is a simple, rapid, reliable and affordable method that can potentially be applied for the detection of CPV-2 in the research laboratory and point-of-care diagnosis.

As the virus uses 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as a high-affinity receptor determinant for attachment to cells, its binding activity was used to reveal O-acetylated sialic acid residues after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer onto nitrocellulose sheets of proteins and thin-layer chromatography of lipids. The specificity of the binding for O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates was investigated. Our results showed that influenza C virus could detect the different forms of the two murine glycophorins which are known to be O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates. The virus also bound to O-acetylated gangliosides isolated from embryonic chicken brain such as purified O-acetylated NeuAc\u03B1(2\u20138)NeuAc\u03B1(2\u20138)NeuAc\u03B1(2\u20133)Gal\u03B2(1\u20134)Glc\u03B2(1-1)ceramide (GT3). The esterase activity of the HEF protein of influenza C virus was used to unmask the sialic acid. After its deacetylation by the virus enzyme, the O-acetylated GT3 was recognized by a monoclonal antibody which binds only to the nonacetylated derivative. The results presented here show that influenza C virus is a discriminating analytical probe for identifying O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates directly after Western blotting of proteins and thin-layer chromatography of lipids, thus providing a new analytical tool.","publish_time":"1991-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manuguerra, Jean-Claude; DuBois, Catherine; Hannoun, Claude","journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3f41e6ee259789186950193c4f1de30601d799c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/000326979190252O; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000326979190252O","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates","O-acetylated GT3","O-acetylated gangliosides","purified O-acetylated NeuAc\u03B1","O-acetylated sialic acid residues","virus enzyme","HEF protein of influenza C virus","unique glycoprotein of influenza C virus","esterase activity","binding activity","layer chromatography of lipids","results","nitrocellulose sheets of proteins","discriminating analytical probe","Western blotting of proteins","new analytical tool","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","transfer","attachment","embryonic chicken brain","high-affinity receptor determinant","cells","different forms","designated hemagglutinin","hemagglutination","functions","murine glycophorins","fusion factor","monoclonal antibody","Glc\u03B2","ceramide","Gal\u03B2","deacetylation","specificity","nonacetylated derivative"],"language":"en"},

To overcome this obstacle, we employed a lipid-mediated protein intracellular delivery reagent (PIDR) that permits internalization of proteins into cells. Although entry of HCVcc was not enhanced by the treatment with PIDR, entry of HCVser into hepatoma cell lines (Huh7 and HepG2) and immortalized primary hepatocytes (Hc and HuS/E2) was significantly enhanced by the PIDR treatment. The entry of HCVser into Huh7 cells in the presence of PIDR was resistant to the neutralization by an anti-hCD81 antibody, suggesting that PIDR is capable of internalizing HCVser in a receptor-independent manner. Interestingly, the PIDR-mediated entry of HCVser and HCVcc was enhanced by the addition of sera from chronic hepatitis C patients but not from healthy donors. In addition, neutralization of HCVcc infection by anti-E2 antibody was canceled by the treatment with PIDR. In conclusion, the PIDR is a valuable tool to get over the obstacle of neutralizing antibodies to internalize HCV into cells and might be useful for the establishment of in vitro propagation HCVser.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fukuhara, Takasuke; Tani, Hideki; Shiokawa, Mai; Goto, Yukinori; Abe, Takayuki; Taketomi, Akinobu; Shirabe, Ken; Maehara, Yoshihiko; Matsuura, Yoshiharu","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50b1018922372959d4c12bea2f73a2069aabe0a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129305.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21262370/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457911000220; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2011.01.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457911000220","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PIDR","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PIDR treatment","PIDR-mediated entry of HCVser","presence of PIDR","propagation HCVser","entry of HCVcc","capable of internalizing HCVser","Huh7 cells","anti-E2 antibody","neutralization of HCVcc infection","presence of neutralizing antibody","anti-hCD81 antibody","obstacle of neutralizing antibodies","addition of sera","hepatoma cell lines","serum-derived HCV","reliable cell culture system","lipid-mediated protein intracellular delivery reagent","HepG2","chronic hepatitis C patients","immortalized primary hepatocytes","HuS","receptor-independent manner","tropism","healthy donors","valuable tool","internalization of proteins","establishment of","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

This material worked as an immobilisation and transduction surface. A 30-mer sequence that encodes a short lysine-rich region, unique to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, was chosen as target. A complementary strand (probe), labelled with a thiol group at the 3\u2032-end, was immobilised on the film. After blocking the surface, hybridisation with the biotin-conjugated SARS strand (at the 3\u2032-end) took place. Interaction with alkaline phosphatase-labelled streptavidin permits amplified indirect electrochemical detection. The analytical signal is constituted by an electrochemical process of indigo carmine, the soluble product of the enzymatic hydrolysis of 3-indoxyl phosphate. The use of a sensitive electrochemical technique such as square wave voltammetry allowed a detection limit of 6pM to be obtained for this DNA sequence, lower than any other found in the bibliography. The parameters affecting the methodology were studied, with special attention being placed on selectivity. Specificity was clearly enhanced when interaction time and stringency (in the form of formamide percentage) were increased. With 1h of strand interaction and employing 50% of formamide in the hybridisation buffer, a 3-base mismatch strand was perfectly distinguished from the complementary.","publish_time":"2005-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abad-Valle, Patricia; Fern\u00E1ndez-Abedul, M.

However, questions remain regarding cost-effectiveness of performing these diagnostic tests in routine and their real impact on patient care. This article will review available data and highlight unresolved questions about cost-effectiveness, infection control, clinical utility and public health impact of multiplex respiratory virus assays.","publish_time":"2013-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valli\u00E8res, Emilie; Renaud, Christian","journal":"Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7166fd934b8ddccaf01dd889975254747b5fc2b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132665.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2013.03.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889313001417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23601453/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889313001417","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical impact","real impact","clinical utility","public health impact of multiplex respiratory virus assays","cost-effectiveness","respiratory viruses","understanding of respiratory virus epidemiology","everyday clinical practice","unresolved questions","multiplex PCR","patient care","variety of molecular assays","specific patient populations","infection control","concerns","routine","available data","diagnostic tests","decade","article"],"language":"en"},

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was very recently identified as a functional receptor for SARS virus and is therefore a prime target for pathogenesis and pharmacological intervention. Rats of both genders at three distinct ages (young-adult, 3 months; middle-aged, 12 months; old, 24 months) were evaluated to determine the characteristic of ACE2 expression in lung and the effect of aging and gender on its expression. ACE2 was predominantly expressed in alveolar epithelium, bronchiolar epithelium, endothelium and smooth muscle cells of pulmonary vessels with similar content, whereas no obvious signal was detected in the bronchiolar smooth muscle cells. ACE2 expression is dramatically reduced with aging in both genders: young-adult vs. old P \u003C0.001 (by 78% in male and 67% in female, respectively) and middle-aged vs. old P \u003C0.001 (by 71% in male rats and 59% in female rats, respectively). The decrease of ACE2 content was relatively slight between young-adult and middle-aged groups (by 25% in male and 18% in female, respectively). Although there was no gender-related difference of ACE2 in young-adult and middle-aged groups, a significantly higher ACE2 content was detected in old female rats than male. In conclusion, the more elevated ACE2 in young adults as compared to aged groups may contribute to the predominance in SARS attacks in this age group.","publish_time":"2006-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xudong, Xie; Junzhu, Chen; Xingxiang, Wang; Furong, Zhang; Yanrong, Liu","journal":"Life Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7684a38d0d7d2c6e65a82b43ec39ffa64fda2297.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094566.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320505010386; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320505010386","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["young-adult","elevated ACE2","old female rats","higher ACE2 content","decrease of ACE2 content","characteristic of ACE2 expression","young adults","middle-aged groups","obvious predominance of young adult patients","gender-related difference of ACE2","old P","months","slight female proneness","bronchiolar epithelium","similar content","bronchiolar smooth muscle cells","SARS virus","SARS attacks","genders","smooth muscle cells of pulmonary vessels","alveolar epithelium","obvious signal","effect of aging","endothelium","severe acute respiratory syndrome","prime target","lung","distinct ages","pathogenesis","pharmacological intervention","age group","functional receptor","Abstract Epidemiologic data","angiotensin","enzyme","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

IFITM3 is essential for control of influenza virus infection in mice and humans. In contrast, the role of IFITM proteins in coronavirus infection is less well defined. Employing a retroviral vector system for analysis of coronavirus entry, we investigated the susceptibility of human-adapted and emerging coronaviruses to inhibition by IFITM proteins. We found that entry of the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is sensitive to inhibition by IFITM proteins. In 293T cells, IFITM-mediated inhibition of cellular entry of the emerging MERS- and SARS-CoV was less efficient than blockade of entry of the globally circulating human coronaviruses 229E and NL63. Similar differences were not observed in A549 cells, suggesting that cellular context and/or IFITM expression levels can impact inhibition efficiency. The differential IFITM-sensitivity of coronaviruses observed in 293T cells afforded the opportunity to investigate whether efficiency of entry inhibition by IFITMs and endosomal cholesterol accumulation correlate. No such correlation was observed. Furthermore, entry mediated by the influenza virus hemagglutinin was robustly inhibited by IFITM3 but was insensitive to accumulation of endosomal cholesterol, indicating that modulation of cholesterol synthesis/transport did not account for the antiviral activity of IFITM3. Collectively, these results show that the emerging MERS-CoV is a target of the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins and demonstrate that mechanisms other than accumulation of endosomal cholesterol can contribute to viral entry inhibition by IFITMs.","publish_time":"2014-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wrensch, Florian; Winkler, Michael; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fd379bd7d8ce15f444b2fa608e6c5899441d52a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4189045.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v6093683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25256397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFITM"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["efficiency of entry inhibition","IFITM-mediated inhibition of cellular entry","viral entry inhibition","role of IFITM proteins","accumulation of cholesterol","blockade of entry","accumulation of endosomal cholesterol","antiviral activity of IFITM proteins","analysis of coronavirus entry","inhibition efficiency","endosomal cholesterol accumulation correlate","IFITM expression levels","host cell entry","differential IFITM-sensitivity","emerging MERS-CoV","emerging coronaviruses","coronavirus infection","human coronaviruses","endosomal compartments","T cells","modulation of cholesterol synthesis","antiviral activity of IFITM3","IFITMs","SARS-CoV","A549 cells","control of influenza virus infection","influenza virus hemagglutinin","cellular context","susceptibility of human","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","target","mice","retroviral vector system","mechanisms","enveloped viruses","humans","transport","opportunity","interferon-inducible transmembrane","NL63","contrast","Similar differences","results","correlation"],"language":"en"},

The role of viral infections in the etiology of severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) was prospectively evaluated from 2008 to 2012 at a university-level intensive care unit. Methods. Clinical data and microbiological tests were assessed: blood cultures, urine pneumococcal and legionella antigens, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies from paired serums, and respiratory virus detection by multiplex, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs and lower tracheal specimens via intubation tube. Results. Of 49 mechanically ventilated SCAP patients (21 men and 28 women; median age, 54 years), the etiology was identified in 45 cases (92%). There were 21 pure bacterial infections (43%), 5 probably pure viral infections (10%), and 19 mixed bacterial\u2013viral infections (39%), resulting in viral etiology in 24 patients (49%). Of 26 viruses, 21 (81%) were detected from bronchial specimens and 5 (19%) from nasopharyngeal swabs. Rhinovirus (15 cases, 58%) and adenovirus (4 cases, 15%) were the most common viral findings. The bacterial\u2013viral etiology group had the highest peak C-reactive protein levels (median, 356 [25th\u201375th percentiles, 294\u2013416], P = .05), whereas patients with probably viral etiology had the lowest peak procalcitonin levels (1.7 [25th\u201375th percentiles, 1.6\u20131.7]). The clinical characteristics of pure bacterial and mixed bacterial\u2013viral etiologies were comparable. Hospital stay was longest among the bacterial group (17 vs 14 days; P = .02). Conclusions. Viral findings were demonstrated in almost half of the SCAP patients. Clinical characteristics were similar between the pure bacterial and mixed bacterial\u2013viral infections groups. The frequency of viral detection depends on the availability of PCR techniques and lower respiratory specimens.","publish_time":"2014-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karhu, J.; Ala-Kokko, T.

The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources. COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care. Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients. In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy. We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care. By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGrath, Brendan A; Brenner, Michael J; Warrillow, Stephen J; Pandian, Vinciya; Arora, Asit; Cameron, Tanis S; A\u00F1on, Jos\u00E9 Manuel; Hern\u00E1ndez Mart\u00EDnez, Gonzalo; Truog, Robert D; Block, Susan D; Lui, Grace C Y; McDonald, Christine; Rassekh, Christopher H; Atkins, Joshua; Qiang, Li; Vergez, S\u00E9bastien; Dulguerov, Pavel; Zenk, Johannes; Antonelli, Massimo; Pelosi, Paolo; Walsh, Brian K; Ward, Erin; Shang, You; Gasparini, Stefano; Donati, Abele; Singer, Mervyn; Openshaw, Peter J M; Tolley, Neil; Markel, Howard; Feller-Kopman, David J","journal":"The Lancet.

Infectious diseases are of particular concern at MGs. The aim of this review was to summarize findings in the field of infectious diseases with a variety of pathogens associated with international MGs in the last 5 years. RECENT FINDINGS: In the context of Hajj, one of the largest religious MGs at Mecca, Saudi Arabia, respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of infectious diseases in pilgrims with a prevalence of 50\u201393%. The most commonly acquired respiratory viruses were human rhinovirus, followed by human coronaviruses and influenza A virus, in decreasing order. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the predominant bacteria. The prevalence of Hajj-related diarrhea ranged from 1.1 to 23.3% and etiologies included Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli, with evidence of acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. In other MGs such as Muslim, Christian, and Hindu religious events, sports events, and large-scale open-air festivals, outbreaks have been reported less frequently. The most common outbreaks at these events involved diseases preventable by vaccination, notably measles and influenza. Gastrointestinal infections caused by a variety of pathogens were also recorded. SUMMARY: Because social distancing and contact avoidance are difficult measures to implement in the context of many MGs, individual preventive measures including vaccination, use of face mask, disposable handkerchief and hand hygiene may be recommended. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these measures has been poorly investigated in the context of MGs.","publish_time":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoang, Van-Thuan; Gautret, Philippe","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e003916d0fe7d4be308a6eecc73544a0142df871.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088693.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-018-0650-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30155747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["Muslim"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["context of MGs","international MGs","largest religious MGs","field of infectious diseases","diseases preventable","context of Hajj","leading cause of infectious diseases","sports events","Hindu religious events","vaccination","difficult measures","variety of pathogens","prevalence of Hajj","respiratory tract infections","individual preventive measures","human rhinovirus","human coronaviruses","respiratory viruses","Gastrointestinal infections","common outbreaks","predominant bacteria","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","RECENT FINDINGS","antimicrobial-resistant bacteria","Saudi Arabia","Mecca","face mask","evidence of acquisition","social distancing","Streptococcus pneumoniae","contact avoidance","large-scale open-air festivals","Staphylococcus aureus","disposable handkerchief","pilgrims","Christian","specific time","Escherichia coli","hand hygiene","high concentration of people","Mass gatherings","measles","particular concern","Haemophilus influenzae","Salmonella","location","SUMMARY","decreasing order","related diarrhea","etiologies","years","aim","effectiveness"],"language":"en"},

However, the relative severity of illness associated with different viruses is unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of hospitalization from different viruses in children presenting with an influenza\u2010like illness (ILI). METHODS: Data from children 5 years old or younger participating in an ILI natural history study from April 2010 to March 2014 was analyzed. The adjusted odds ratio for hospitalization was estimated in children with infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus, bocavirus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and influenza. RESULTS: A total of 1486 children (408 outpatients and 1078 inpatients) were included in this analysis. At least one virus was detected in 1227 (82.6%) patients. The most frequent viruses detected as single pathogens were RSV (n = 286), rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 251), parainfluenza viruses (n = 104), and influenza A or B (n = 99). After controlling for potential confounders (age, sex, recruitment site, days from symptom onset to enrollment, and underlying illnesses), children with RSV and metapneumovirus infections showed a greater likelihood of hospitalization than those infected by parainfluenza viruses (OR 2.7 and 1.9, respectively), rhinovirus/enterovirus (OR 3.1 and 2.1, respectively), coronaviruses (OR 4.9 and 3.4, respectively), adenovirus (OR 4.6 and 3.2, respectively), and influenza (OR 6.3 and 4.4, respectively).

Since then, there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), 2000 deaths, and over 14 000 cases recovered. Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak. METHODS: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. RESULTS: From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols.

Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear. Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice. In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection. Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88(\u2212/\u2212)), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection. The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection. MyD88(\u2212/\u2212) mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection. Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88(\u2212/\u2212) mice compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88(\u2212/\u2212)mice. These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15 infection.","publish_time":"2008-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheahan, Timothy; Morrison, Thomas E.; Funkhouser, William; Uematsu, Satoshi; Akira, Shizou; Baric, Ralph S.; Heise, Mark T.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6825e9b1b3377b18ec3725a954b15d2760603a28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2587915.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19079579/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000240","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mice deficient","lung inflammation","c mice","lethal rMA15 infection","destruction of lung tissue","course of infection","nonlethal infection","post-infection","wild-type mice","severe lung pathology similar","rMA15 results","genetic absence of MyD88","rMA15-induced disease","intranasal infection of young","recruitment of inflammatory monocytes","inflammatory cell recruitment","monocyte recruitment","clinical course of SARS","recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV","higher viral loads","host mediators of protection","disease pathogenesis","host factors","human cases","enhanced pulmonary pathology","novel human coronavirus","chemokines","expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines","lungs","high titer replication","humans","week-old C57BL","innate immune","useful model","mortality","loss of body weight","chemokine receptors","macrophages","Toll","TLR","day","BALB","contrast","adapter protein","laboratory","deaths","data","animal models"],"language":"en"},

During the past 10years, advances in this field allowed to achieve more and more sophisticated CyDs derivatives opening a simple access in scale-up quantities to original and better CyD-based gene delivery systems. In addition, possibility to combine covalent and supramolecular approaches offers new venues for the design of tailor-made CyD-based nanovehicles to improve their transfection ability and gene transfer in cells. In this account, we describe our recent progress in the construction of a novel CyD-based G0 (generation number) core dendrimer, scalable to CyD oligomers by a strategy using protonable guanidine tethers and whose concept can be generalized for the assembly of CyD pre-coated dendrimers.

In February 2007, mumps re-emerged in university students in Nova Scotia. Despite highly sensitive methods for mumps virus detection, only 14% (298/2082) of cases during the peak of the outbreak were laboratory confirmed. Objectives Due to the low positivity rate, this study investigated whether infection with other viral pathogens caused mumps-like presentations during the outbreak. Study design 148 buccal specimens from patients who presented with unilateral or bilateral parotitis but had negative laboratory tests for mumps virus were tested for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) by quantitative PCR and 21 different viral markers using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP). Companion sera to each buccal specimen were available for EBV and CMV serology to differentiate acute infection from reactivation. Results No correlation was observed since viral pathogens were detected in both the parotitis and non-parotitis groups. Conclusion Although there was co-circulation of other viral pathogens during the mumps outbreak, no difference was observed in the prevalence between patients who presented with or without parotitis. The low positivity rate for specimens submitted for mumps diagnostics was likely the result of increased Public Health messaging and physician inexperience in recognizing mumps infection, suggesting the clinical acumen for mumps diagnosis based solely on clinical presentation is low.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hatchette, Todd F.; Mahony, James B.; Chong, Sylvia; LeBlanc, Jason J.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a808f0fce35af7f197bb56230e61c6ca0a255f87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108216.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.09.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209004624; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209004624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19828368/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Luminex","Companion"],"locations":["Nova Scotia"],"keyphrases":["mumps outbreak","mumps diagnosis","mumps diagnostics","mumps virus detection","recognizing mumps infection","Abstract Background Mumps","viral pathogens","bilateral parotitis","low positivity rate","non-parotitis groups","EBV","different viral markers","Epstein-Barr virus","acute infection","buccal specimens","patients","Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel","CMV serology","clinical acumen","clinical presentation","Study design","negative laboratory tests","physician inexperience","result of increased Public Health messaging","quantitative PCR","cytomegalovirus","vaccine preventable disease","RVP","university students","co-circulation","sensitive methods","presentations","Companion sera","Nova Scotia","reactivation","peak","Objectives","difference","Conclusion","prevalence","cases","correlation"],"language":"en"},

This situation highlighted a requirement for supplementary tests for precise virus-typing. As a result, we developed a RT-PCR assay able to detect as well as type PRRSV. To provide maximal sequence information, complete viral open reading frames (ORFs 5 and 7) were targeted for amplification. The RT-PCR test was able to amplify complete PRRSV ORFs from complex materials such as boar semen containing as little as 1 TCID50 ml\u22121 of PRRSV. Typing of viruses was accomplished by any one of three strategies: (i) use of type-specific PCR primers, (ii) size determination of ORF 7 amplicons, (iii) DNA sequencing. All three typing strategies showed complete concordance with the currently used method of typing with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) when used on a panel of PRRSV field isolates covering the period 1992\u20131997. The ORF 7-based test had particularly desirable characteristics, namely, highly sensitive detection of PRRSV without apparent type bias, typing of the detected virus, discrimination between pure and mixed virus populations, and semi-quantitative assessment of type ratios in mixed populations, all in a single PCR reaction. In addition, the obtained sequence data were used to predict two simple and rapid strategies (single-enzyme restriction length polymorphy analysis and oligonucleotide hybridization) for confirmation of the specificity of ORF 7 RT-PCR reactions. As such, the RT-PCR assay provides a new, powerful diagnostic tool to study the population dynamics between present and emerging PRRSV-types.","publish_time":"1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oleksiewicz, M.

The existence of a paleovirus can sometimes be detected by virtue of its accidental insertion into the germline of different animal species, which allows one to date when the virus actually existed. However, the ancient and the modern often connect, as modern viruses have unexpected origins that can be traced to ancient infections. The genomes of two species of mongooses and an egg-laying mammal called an echidna show that a virus currently present in poultry, the reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), is actually of ancient exotic mammalian origin. REV apparently spread to poultry through a circuitous route involving the isolation of malaria parasites from a pheasant from Borneo housed at the Bronx Zoo that was contaminated with REV. Repeated passage of this virus in poultry adapted the virus to its new host. At some point, the virus got inserted into another virus, called fowlpox virus, which has spread back into the wild. Although REV may still exist somewhere in a mammalian host, its modern form links an 8 million-year-old infection of the ancestor of a mongoose to a virus that now is circulating in wild birds through malaria studies in the mid-20(th) century. These lessons of ancient and modern viruses have implications for modern human pandemics from viral reservoirs and for human interventions that may come with unintended consequences.","publish_time":"2013-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Etienne, Lucie; Emerman, Michael","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06c172a11ee30931ac537dfb70ce020dced50918.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3754884.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24013523/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001641","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reticuloendotheliosis virus","fowlpox virus","modern viruses","modern form","poultry","study of ancient viruses","lessons of ancient","ancient infections","REV","modern human pandemics","ancient exotic mammalian origin","mammalian host","human interventions","malaria studies","species of mongooses","wild birds","new host","isolation of malaria parasites","germline of different animal species","implications","viral reservoirs","Borneo","pheasant","ancestor","accidental insertion","circuitous route","egg","echidna","year-old infection","Repeated passage","unexpected origins","virtue","Bronx Zoo","Paleovirology","unintended consequences","paleovirus","century","genomes","date","existence","point"],"language":"en"},

Overall, phosphorylated (p-) AKT, p-ribosomal protein S6 (S6) and p-4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) expression levels were examined by immunohistochemistry in anogenital tumors both with and without positive telomerase activity. RESULTS: Positive telomerase activity was detected in 41.7% of Bowenoid papulosis and 27.3% of condyloma acuminatum compared to normal skin (p \u003C 0.001).

CONCLUSION: Combined analysis of the IAPs family, c-Myc mRNA expression, telomerase activity levels and p-Akt/p-S6 expressions may provide clinically relevant molecular markers in HPV associated anogenital tumors.","publish_time":"2010-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitsuishi, Tsuyoshi; Iwabu, Yukie; Tokunaga, Kenzo; Sata, Tetsutaro; Kaneko, Takehiko; Ohara, Kuniaki; Ohsawa, Ikuroh; Oda, Fumino; Yamada, Yuko; Kawana, Seiji; Ozaki, Kohji; Nakatake, Mayuka; Yamada, Osamu","journal":"BMC Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/241ba286b5b231ad009c7e9a28c85aacbdff49a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2868050.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20346172/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-10-118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPV","Bowenoid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p-Akt","p-4EBP1 expression","p-S6 expressions","p-ribosomal protein S6","expression levels of Bowenoid papulosis","levels of telomerase activity","telomerase activity levels","condyloma acuminatum of anogenital tumors","c-Myc mRNA expression levels","c-IAP1","c-IAP2","positive telomerase activity","HPV associated anogenital tumors","specimens of Bowenoid papulosis","specimens of condyloma acuminatum","condyloma acuminatum samples","IAPs family","anogenital areas","XIAP mRNA","high risk HPV","normal skin","regulation of apoptosis","relevant molecular markers","inhibitor of apoptosis proteins","E-binding protein","cellular proliferation","clinical course of human papillomavirus","Combined analysis","immunohistochemistry","BACKGROUND","molecules","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","contrast","genes","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases. However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the range from 16.8 \u00B0C to 27.4 \u00B0C. Each 1 \u00B0C rise of temperature was associated with a \u22124.8951% (t = \u22122.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the results of the model. The predicted R-squared of the polynomial linear regression model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8 \u00B0C to 27.4 \u00B0C. Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases. The curve flattened at a threshold of 25.8 \u00B0C. There is no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8 \u00B0C. The study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prata, David N.; Rodrigues, Waldecy; Bermejo, Paulo H.","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc7a5fcd4ce8ced4b5005d4ea8d09da2fcdf9f0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182516.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361443/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720323792; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720323792?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138862","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GAM"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["number of cases","relationship of temperature","daily number of confirmed cases","number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID","negative linear relationship","tropical temperatures of Brazil","growth curve of COVID","polynomial linear regression model","state capital cities of Brazil","nonlinear relationship","annual average temperatures","C rise of temperature","annual average temperature compensation","Cumulative data","GAM dose-response curve","generalized additive model","specific study","results","tropical climate","goal of supporting governance","variation","infection","ecological factors","search","transmission","survival","healthcare policymakers","outbreak","robustness","severe public health issue","behavior","sensitivity analysis","predicted R","novelty","coronavirus disease","range","threshold","evidence","studies","work"],"language":"en"},

Patient outcomes were followed until February 19, 2020. Patients were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications, and length of hospital stay. Abnormal liver function was defined as increased levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin. Results Fifty-five patients (37.2%) had abnormal liver function at hospital admission; 14.5% of these patients had high fever (14.5%), compared with 4.3% of patients with normal liver function (P=.027). Patients with abnormal liver function were more likely to be male, and had higher levels of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein.

The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the chronic status of CRS. STUDY DESIGN: A case\u2010control prospective study. METHODS: Fifty\u2010three control subjects, and 67 CRS with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) and 61 CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) patients without signs of acute viral infection were enrolled. Epithelial cells scraped from the middle nasal meatus were tested for the nucleic acid of nine common respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction assay. The clinical disease severity was compared between subjects with and without viral infection. RESULTS: The overall detection rate of viral infection was 75.47%, 68.66%, and 73.77% in controls, CRSwNP, and CRSsNP, respectively, and no significant difference among studied groups was observed. There was no significant difference in detection rate of any specific individual virus or multiple viruses among the groups studied either. Visual analog scale scores of symptoms, computed tomography scores, or endoscope scores did not show obvious difference between subjects with and without viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Although a high frequency of viral infection could be observed in the middle nasal meatus, no increase of frequency of viral infection could be demonstrated in chronic persistent phase of CRSsNP and CRSwNP.

The current outbreak is significant in several ways, including longevity, magnitude of morbidity and mortality, occurrence outside the traditional niches, rapid spread and potential of becoming a global health tragedy. The authors provided explicit insights into the current and historical background, drivers of the epidemic, societal impacts, status of vaccines and drugs development and proffered recommendations to halt and prevent future occurrences. The authors reviewed mainly five databases and a hand search of key relevant literature. We reviewed 51 articles that were relevant up until the 18(th) of August 2014. The authors supplemented the search with reference list of relevant articles and grey literature as well as relevant Internet websites. Article searches were limited to those published either in English or French. There are strong indications that the EVD may have been triggered by increased human activities and encroachment into the forest ecosystem spurred by increasing population and poverty-driven forest-dependent local economy. Containment efforts are being hampered by weak and fragile health systems, including public health surveillance and weak governance, certain socio-anthropological factors, fast travels (improved transport systems) and globalization. The societal impacts of the EBV outbreak are grave, including economic shutdown, weakening of socio-political systems, psychological distress, and unprecedented consumption of scarce health resources. The research and development (R\u0026D) pipeline for product against EBV seems grossly insufficient. The outbreak of Ebola and the seeming difficulty to contain the epidemic is simply a reflection of the weak health system, poor surveillance and emergency preparedness/response, poverty and disconnect between the government and the people in many West African countries. Although interventions by the United Nations and other international development agencies could ultimately halt the epidemic, local communities must be engaged to build trust and create demand for the public health interventions being implemented in the Ebola-ravaged populations. In the intermediate and long term, post-Ebola rehabilitation should focus on strengthening of health systems, improving awareness about zoonosis and health behaviors, alleviating poverty and mitigating the impact of triggering factors. Finally, national governments and international development partners should mobilize huge resources and investments to spur or facilitate R\u0026D of disease control tools for emerging and pernicious infectious diseases (not limited to EVD).","publish_time":"2016-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Omoleke, Semeeh Akinwale; Mohammed, Ibrahim; Saidu, Yauba","journal":"J Public Health Africa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5b981ab9223ede1243af2a7030ced8570c82edc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5349256.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28299152/; https://doi.org/10.4081/jphia.2016.534","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBV","United Nations"],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["health behaviors","fragile health systems","public health surveillance","weak health system","public health interventions","outbreak of Ebola","global health tragedy","current outbreak","EBV outbreak","epidemic","EVD","authors","unprecedented consumption of scarce health resources","drugs development","socio-political systems","international development partners","international development agencies","weak governance","improved transport systems","alleviating poverty","longest Ebola viral diseases","hand search of key relevant literature","post-Ebola rehabilitation","reference list of relevant articles","societal impacts","relevant Internet websites","Ebola-ravaged populations","poverty-driven forest-dependent local economy","West African countries","poor surveillance","grey literature","forest ecosystem","huge resources","local communities","West African sub-continent","certain socio-anthropological factors","pernicious infectious diseases","impact of triggering factors","D of disease control tools","fast travels","potential","zoonosis","emergency preparedness","status of vaccines","mortality","traditional niches","drivers","proffered recommendations","psychological distress","historical background","economic shutdown","longevity","rapid spread","long term","response","ways","product","United Nations","grave","pipeline","awareness","magnitude of morbidity","explicit insights","encroachment","people","investments","databases","national governments","demand","reflection","human activities","modern medical history","trust","globalization","research","difficulty","future occurrences","strong indications","Containment efforts","Article searches","English","French"],"language":"en"},

Powered by the natural diversity of immune response, hpAbs are effective in treating diseases caused by complex or quickly-evolving antigens such as viruses. We previously showed that transchromosomic (Tc) cattle carrying a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin heavy-chain (hIGH) and kappa-chain (hIGK) germline loci (named as \u03BAHAC) are capable of producing functional hpAbs when both of the bovine immunoglobulin mu heavy-chains, bIGHM and bIGHML1, are homozygously inactivated (double knockouts or DKO). However, B lymphocyte development in these Tc cattle is compromised, and the overall production of hpAbs is low. Here, we report the construction of an improved HAC, designated as cKSL-HAC\u0394, by incorporating all of the human immunoglobulin germline loci into the HAC. Furthermore, for avoiding the possible human-bovine interspecies incompatibility between the human immunoglobulin mu chain protein (hIgM) and bovine transmembrane \u03B1 and \u03B2 immunoglobulins (bIg\u03B1 and bIg\u03B2) in the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex, we partially replaced (bovinized) the hIgM constant domain with the counterpart of bovine IgM (bIgM) that is involved in the interaction between bIgM and bIg\u03B1/Ig\u03B2; human IgM bovinization would also improve the functionality of hIgM in supporting B cell activation and proliferation. We also report the successful production of DKO Tc cattle carrying the cKSL-HAC\u0394 (cKSL-HAC\u0394/DKO), the dramatic improvement of B cell development in these cattle and the high level production of hpAbs (as measured for the human IgG isotype) in the plasma.

No journal article has previously performed a comprehensive assessment of this subject. INTRODUCTION: Multiple case reports and other references demonstrate a causal association between suicidal risk and LAD. Suicide risk is greater in outdoor workers and veterans, both with greater LAD exposure. Multiple studies demonstrate many infections and the associated proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory-mediated metabolic changes, and quinolinic acid and glutamate changes alter neural circuits which increase suicidality. A similar pathophysiology occurs in LAD. METHOD: A retrospective chart review and epidemiological calculations were performed. RESULTS: LAD contributed to suicidality, and sometimes homicidality, in individuals who were not suicidal before infection. A higher level of risk to self and others is associated with multiple symptoms developing after acquiring LAD, in particular, explosive anger, intrusive images, sudden mood swings, paranoia, dissociative episodes, hallucinations, disinhibition, panic disorder, rapid cycling bipolar, depersonalization, social anxiety disorder, substance abuse, hypervigilance, generalized anxiety disorder, genital\u2013urinary symptoms, chronic pain, anhedonia, depression, low frustration tolerance, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Negative attitudes about LAD from family, friends, doctors, and the health care system may also contribute to suicide risk. By indirect calculations, it is estimated there are possibly over 1,200 LAD suicides in the US per year. CONCLUSION: Suicidality seen in LAD contributes to causing a significant number of previously unexplained suicides and is associated with immune-mediated and metabolic changes resulting in psychiatric and other symptoms which are possibly intensified by negative attitudes about LAD from others. Some LAD suicides are associated with being overwhelmed by multiple debilitating symptoms, and others are impulsive, bizarre, and unpredictable. Greater understanding and a direct method of acquiring LAD suicide statistics is needed. It is suggested that medical examiners, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other epidemiological organizations proactively evaluate the association between LAD and suicide.","publish_time":"2017-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bransfield, Robert C","journal":"Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bff87fb06752caeb076ed369f904a8c5e4797422.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5481283.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s136137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670127/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LAD suicides","greater LAD exposure","Suicide risk","direct method of acquiring LAD suicide statistics","multiple symptoms","suicidal risk","multiple debilitating symptoms","suicidality","associated diseases","metabolic changes","urinary symptoms","Multiple studies","social anxiety disorder","generalized anxiety disorder","associated proinflammatory cytokines","posttraumatic stress disorder","glutamate changes","causal association","Greater understanding","Multiple case reports","epidemiological calculations","higher level of risk","unexplained suicides","Negative attitudes","epidemiological organizations","indirect calculations","anhedonia","genital","depersonalization","substance abuse","hypervigilance","sudden mood swings","intrusive images","paranoia","low frustration tolerance","rapid cycling bipolar","dissociative episodes","chronic pain","explosive anger","quinolinic acid","depression","disinhibition","doctors","references","veterans","neural circuits","outdoor workers","Centers","Disease Control","Prevention","hallucinations","retrospective chart review","friends","infections","family","Lyme","health care system","self","significant number","comprehensive assessment","medical examiners","individuals","paper","INTRODUCTION","year","journal article","PURPOSE","aim","subject","homicidality","similar pathophysiology","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, data from developing countries are rare and dynamic change of lymphocyte counts in severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1 is scarcely reported. This study aimed to observe change of lymphocyte counts in patients with severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and to investigate the correlation of lymphopenia and severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the white blood cell counts and differentials and other clinical data in 21 hospitalized patients with severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1 confirmed by reverse-transcription PCR during 2009 and 2010. RESULTS: All patients, except two cases with bacterial co-infections, had normal or reduced white blood cell counts. Seventeen (81.0%) patients had decreased lymphocyte proportions (\u003C20%) and counts (\u003C0.8 \u00D7 10(9)/L), with the lowest value of 1.2% and 0.1 \u00D7 10(9)/L respectively. A patient with nosocomial infection of influenza A/H1N1 showed that lymphopenia occurred on the first day of illness. Lymphocyte proportions and absolute counts returned to normal or slightly higher than normal in 16 of the 17 patients within 2\u20133 weeks after the disease onset. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphopenia along with other clinical parameters may be helpful in early differential diagnosis of severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1.","publish_time":"2019-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Yandong; Zhao, Hong; Song, Peixin; Zhang, Zhaoping; Chen, Junhao; Zhou, Yi-Hua","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c74b16c930c38fdedabd3ab5fb0f11d2f7bc57da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102863.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119301856; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.05.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119301856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lymphopenia"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1","early differential diagnosis of severe pandemic influenza","absolute counts","nosocomial infection of influenza","hospitalized patients","white blood cell counts","correlation of lymphopenia","dynamic change of lymphocyte","decreased lymphocyte proportions","clinical data","clinical parameters","developing countries","developed countries","differentials","bacterial co-infections","cases","reverse-transcription PCR","weeks","disease onset","CONCLUSIONS","study","day of illness","lowest value","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

They are foremost controllers of both innate and acquired immunity, healthy tissue homeostasis, vasculogenesis and congenital metabolism. Two hallmarks of macrophages are diversity and plasticity due to which they acquire a wobbling array of phenotypes. These phenotypes are appropriately synchronized responses to a variety of different stimuli from either the tissue microenvironment or \u2013 microbes or their products. Based on the phenotype, macrophages are classified into classically activated/(M1) and alternatively activated/(M2) which are further sub-categorized into M2a, M2b, M2c and M2d based upon gene expression profiles. Macrophage phenotype metamorphosis is the regulating factor in initiation, progression, and termination of numerous inflammatory diseases. Several transcriptional factors and other factors controlling gene expression such as miRNAs contribute to the transformation of macrophages at different points in different diseases. Understanding the mechanisms of macrophage polarization and modulation of their phenotypes to adjust to the micro environmental conditions might provide us a great prospective for designing novel therapeutic strategy. In view of the above, this review summarises the activation of macrophages, the factors intricated in activation along with benefaction of macrophage polarization in response to microbial infections, pulmonary toxicity, lung injury and other inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary dysplasia (COPD), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), asthma and sepsis, along with the existing efforts to develop therapies targeting this facet of macrophage biology.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arora, Shweta; Dev, Kapil; Agarwal, Beamon; Das, Pragnya; Syed, Mansoor Ali","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0150622984aaf93314f67898865dd75ec543b00c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114886.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298517302073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146235/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2017.11.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298517302073","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different diseases","activation of macrophages","transformation of macrophages","hallmarks of macrophages","Abstract Macrophages","different points","different organs","benefaction of macrophage polarization","mechanisms of macrophage polarization","Macrophage phenotype metamorphosis","variety of different stimuli","facet of macrophage biology","transcriptional factors","termination of numerous inflammatory diseases","gene expression profiles","wobbling array of phenotypes","pulmonary toxicity","chronic obstructive pulmonary dysplasia","bronchopulmonary dysplasia","tissue microenvironment","healthy tissue homeostasis","microbial infections","COPD","lung injury","immunity","vasculogenesis","progression","M2d","regulating factor","initiation","BPD","therapies","M2c","miRNAs","congenital metabolism","synchronized responses","sepsis","novel therapeutic strategy","M2a","M2b","asthma","blood","modulation","micro environmental conditions","existing efforts","barrier","microbes","tissues","diversity","plasticity","review","foremost controllers","products","M1"],"language":"en"},

Cross-reactivity across several bacterial genera indicated that the epitopes reactive to Sal-06mAb are conserved among these members. Neutralizing effects of Sal-06mAb on Salmonella growth and survival was evaluated in vitro using bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity with and without complement and bacterial invasion inhibition assay. Sal-06mAb demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect on the growth of S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 strain which is both time and concentration (of mAb) dependent. It was also found that the bacterial growth inhibition was complement independent. When the bacterial cells were preincubated with Sal-06mAb, it reduced the adherence and invasion of bacterial cells into A549 epithelial cell line. This was confirmed by CFU count analysis, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopy. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging confirmed the antimicrobial effects of Sal-06mAb on S. typhimurium ATCC 14028.

One of the most common measurements of stress in laboratory animals is the corticosterone assessment. However, while this measurement provides a highly accurate reflection of the animal\u0027s response to acute stressors, its interpretation is more prone to error when evaluating the effect of chronic stress. This study evaluated the use of the neutrophil:lymphocyte (NE:LY) ratio as an assessment of chronic stress in male and female C57Bl/6N mice as compared to serum corticosterone. One group of mice was exposed to mild daily stressors for 7 days, while the control group was handled with normal husbandry. The NE:LY ratio and serum corticosterone levels were significantly elevated in the chronically stressed mice, though a significant increase in corticosterone was only significant in males when compared by sex. The chronically stressed mice also demonstrated significantly fewer entries into the open arms and less time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, suggesting that the mild daily stressors had induced a state of distress. The findings of this study confirm that the NE:LY ratio is a valid measurement for chronic stress in the laboratory mouse. However, these assays do not distinguish between distress or eustress, so behavioral and physiological assessments should always be included to determine a complete assessment of the well-being of the mouse.

None of the previous studies of naturally occurring colds has conducted appropriate virological assays to determine the nature of the infecting agent. This is an essential methodological step in studies of malaise associated with URTIs. The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of naturally occurring colds on mood and objective measures of performance. This was done by first conducting a cross-sectional comparison of 37 healthy people and 158 volunteers with colds and then a longitudinal study in which 100 volunteers developed colds and 87 remained healthy. Virological techniques were used to identify infecting agents and comparisons made across the different groups. The results showed that having a cold was associated with reduced alertness and slowed reaction times. These effects were observed both for colds where the infecting virus was identified and those where it was not. Similar effects were obtained for both rhinovirus and coronavirus colds. One may conclude that upper respiratory tract illnesses lead to a reduction in subjective alertness and impaired psychomotor functioning. This was true for both illnesses where the infecting agent was identified and for those clinical illnesses where no virus was detected. It is now important to identify the mechanisms linking infection and illness with the behavioural changes. Similarly, the impact of these effects on real-life activities such as driving needs examining. Finally, methods of treatment need to be developed which not only treat the local symptoms of the illnesses but remove the negative mood and the performance impairments. \u00A9 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These disorders share underlying pathophysiology related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that may be clinically insightful. In particular, activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is dysregulated in cardiovascular disease, and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to initiate the infection. Cardiovascular disease and pharmacologic RAS inhibition both increase ACE2 levels, which may increase the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 within the lung and heart. Conversely, mechanistic evidence from related coronaviruses suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may downregulate ACE2, leading to toxic overaccumulation of Angiotensin II that induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and fulminant myocarditis. RAS inhibition could mitigate this effect. With conflicting mechanistic evidence, we propose key clinical research priorities necessary to clarify the role of RAS inhibition in COVID-19 mortality that could be rapidly addressed by the international research community.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanff, Thomas C; Harhay, Michael O; Brown, Tyler S; Cohen, Jordana B; Mohareb, Amir M","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8edf35c1ee0ae65d00ecd1d87b98f48bcce861ee.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cardiovascular disease","SARS-CoV","coronavirus disease","role of RAS inhibition","pharmacologic RAS inhibition","ACE2 levels","enzyme","virulence of SARS","COVID","Mortality","infection","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute respiratory distress syndrome","renin-angiotensin system","toxic overaccumulation of Angiotensin","conflicting mechanistic evidence","related coronaviruses","international research community","key clinical research priorities necessary","fulminant myocarditis","underlying pathophysiology","activity","diabetes","hypertension","disorders","lung","effect","heart"],"language":"en"},

These primary cases are of particular interest for understanding the source(s) and route(s) of transmission and for designing long\u2010term disease control measures. Dromedary camels are the only animal species for which there is convincing evidence that it is a host species for MERS\u2010CoV and hence a potential source of human infections. However, only a small proportion of the primary cases have reported contact with camels. Other possible sources and vehicles of infection include food\u2010borne transmission through consumption of unpasteurized camel milk and raw meat, medicinal use of camel urine and zoonotic transmission from other species. There are critical knowledge gaps around this new disease which can only be closed through traditional field epidemiological investigations and studies designed to test hypothesis regarding sources of infection and risk factors for disease. Since the 1960s, there has been a radical change in dromedary camel farming practices in the Arabian Peninsula with an intensification of the production and a concentration of the production around cities. It is possible that the recent intensification of camel herding in the Arabian Peninsula has increased the virus\u0027 reproductive number and attack rate in camel herds while the \u2018urbanization\u2019 of camel herding increased the frequency of zoonotic \u2018spillover\u2019 infections from camels to humans. It is reasonable to assume, although difficult to measure, that the sensitivity of public health surveillance to detect previously unknown diseases is lower in East Africa than in Saudi Arabia and that sporadic human cases may have gone undetected there.","publish_time":"2014-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gossner, C.; Danielson, N.; Gervelmeyer, A.; Berthe, F.; Faye, B.; Kaasik Aaslav, K.; Adlhoch, C.; Zeller, H.; Penttinen, P.; Coulombier, D.","journal":"Zoonoses Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6597a18a90131861cb3538d418958696254753fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165574.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25545147/; https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12171","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Arabian Peninsula","East Africa","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["camel herds","primary cases","reported cases","human MERS","sporadic human cases","recent intensification of camel herding","dromedary camel farming practices","zoonotic transmission","Dromedary camels","medicinal use of camel urine","consumption of unpasteurized camel milk","Arabian Peninsula","sources of infection","CoV case","host species","potential source of human infections","animal species","new disease","possible sources","production","East Africa","frequency of zoonotic","documented contact","vehicles of infection","long\u2010term disease control measures","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","raw meat","unknown diseases","Saudi Arabia","studies","attack rate","reproductive number","radical change","hypothesis","spillover","food","sensitivity of public health surveillance","risk factors","traditional field epidemiological investigations","critical knowledge gaps","convincing evidence","concentration","route","urbanization","humans","small proportion","cities"],"language":"en"},

In addition, rapid and accurate diagnosis of a large panel of viral and atypical pathogens can be crucial in immunocompromised patients. Objectives First, to evaluate the performance of the Simplexa\u2122 Direct assay system in comparison with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and customized Taqman\u00AE Array Card (TAC) testing for RSV, Flu A, and Flu B in immunocompromised patients. Second, to evaluate different algorithms for the detection of respiratory pathogens in terms of cost, turn-around-time (TAT) and diagnostic yield. Study design We collected 125 nasopharyngeal swabs (NTS) and 25 BAL samples from symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Samples for which Simplexa\u2122 and TAC results were discordant underwent verification testing. The TAC assay is based on singleplex RT-PCR, targeting 24 viruses, 8 bacteria and 2 fungi simultaneously. Results The overall sensitivity was significantly lower for DFA testing than for the two molecular methods (p \u003C0.05). Performance characteristics of Simplexa\u2122 testing were not significantly different compared to TAC testing (p \u003E0.1). For BAL samples only, the sensitivity and specificity of the Simplexa\u2122 assay was 100%. In total, 6.7, 16 and 18% of samples were positive for Flu A, Flu B or RSV by DFA, Simplexa\u2122 and TAC testing, respectively. When considering not only these pathogens but also all results for TAC, the method identified 93 samples with one or more respiratory pathogens (62%). A co-infection rate of 15.3% was found by TAC. The estimated costs and TAT were 8.2\u20AC and 2h for DFA, 31.8\u20AC and 1.5h for Simplexa\u2122 and 55\u20AC and 3h for TAC testing. Conclusions Performing the Simplexa\u2122 test 24h a day/7 days a week instead of DFA would considerably improve the overall sensitivity and time-to-result, albeit at a higher cost generated in the laboratory. Performing the TAC would increase the diagnostic yield and detection of co-infections significantly.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steensels, Deborah; Reynders, Marijke; Descheemaeker, Patrick; Curran, Martin D.; Jacobs, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique; Denis, Olivier; Delforge, Marie-Luce; Montesinos, Isabel","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4861039a642043488e2794c5141e99915d5366d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119654.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28365410/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416304980; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.03.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416304980","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DFA","BAL","TAC","TAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TAC testing","DFA testing","TAC assay","TAC results","Flu B","diagnosis of Flu","verification testing","BAL samples","Performance characteristics of Simplexa","RSV","TAT","time","detection of respiratory pathogens","atypical pathogens","overall sensitivity","symptomatic immunocompromised patients","Direct assay system","diagnostic yield","detection of co-infections","accurate diagnosis","molecular methods","different algorithms","terms of cost","higher cost","short turn","direct fluorescent antibody","co-infection rate","Abstract Background Molecular assays","comparison","customized Taqman","large panel of viral","Array Card","nasopharyngeal swabs","viruses","singleplex RT-PCR","days","specificity","considerable clinical importance","Study design","addition","week","bacteria","fungi","laboratory","estimated costs","Objectives","Conclusions","total"],"language":"en"},

Many studies have reported on the release, transport, and exposure of expiratory droplets because of respiratory activities. This review focuses on the airborne spread of infectious agents from mucus to mucus in the indoor environment and their spread as governed by airflows in the respiratory system, around people, and in buildings at different transport stages. Methods We critically review the literature on the release of respiratory droplets, their transport and dispersion in the indoor environment, and the ultimate exposure of a susceptible host, as influenced by airflows. Results These droplets or droplet nuclei are transported by expired airflows, which are sometimes affected by the human body plume and use of a face mask, as well as room airflow. Room airflow is affected by human activities such as walking and door opening, and some droplets are eventually captured by a susceptible individual because of his or her inspired flows; such exposure can eventually lead to long-range spread of airborne pathogens. Direct exposure to the expired fine droplets or droplet nuclei results in short-range airborne transmission. Deposition of droplets and direct personal exposure to expired large droplets can lead to the fomite route and the droplet-borne route, respectively. Conclusions We have shown the opportunities for infection control at different stages of the spread. We propose that the short-range airborne route may be important in close contact, and its control may be achieved by face masks for the source patients and use of personalized ventilation. Our discussion of the effect of thermal stratification and expiratory delivery of droplets leads to the suggestion that displacement ventilation may not be applicable to hospital rooms where respiratory infection is a concern.","publish_time":"2016-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Jianjian; Li, Yuguo","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13336eec021e46f42abf94b0e7a7f94c1dd69771.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115322.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27590694/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2016.06.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655316305314; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655316305314","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exposure of expiratory droplets","release of respiratory droplets","large droplets","Deposition of droplets","respiratory infection","expired fine droplets","expiratory delivery of droplets","Direct exposure","respiratory activities","ultimate exposure","respiratory system","short-range airborne route","expired airflows","direct personal exposure","airborne spread of infectious agents","long-range spread of airborne pathogens","droplet nuclei results","short-range airborne transmission","different transport stages","mucus","scientific exploration of infection control","indoor environment","different stages","fomite route","human activities","room airflow","review","severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic","face masks","displacement ventilation","susceptible host","personalized ventilation","susceptible individual","human body plume","effect of thermal stratification","source patients","hospital rooms","opportunities","dispersion","close contact","people","buildings","suggestion","literature","inspired flows","discussion","microbiologists","Background","concern","medical scientists","Methods","Conclusions","studies"],"language":"en"},

However, so far, no single experimental model covers the entire spectrum of the clinical, pathological, or immunological features of the disease. Many different models are available, which proved to be highly useful for studying different aspects of inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. However, the relevance of results from such models for MS pathogenesis has to be critically validated. Current EAE models are mainly based on inflammation, induced by auto-reactive CD4(\u002B) T-cells, and these models reflect important aspects of MS. However, pathological data and results from clinical trials in MS indicate that CD8(\u002B) T-cells and B-lymphocytes may play an important role in propagating inflammation and tissue damage in established MS. Viral models may reflect key features of MS-like inflammatory demyelination, but are difficult to use due to their very complex pathogenesis, involving direct virus-induced and immune-mediated mechanisms. Furthermore, evidence for a role of viruses in MS pathogenesis is indirect and limited, and an MS-specific virus infection has not been identified so far. Toxic models are highly useful to unravel mechanisms of de- and remyelination, but do not reflect other important aspects of MS pathology and pathogenesis. For all these reasons, it is important to select the right experimental model to answer specific questions in MS research.","publish_time":"2016-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lassmann, Hans; Bradl, Monika","journal":"Acta Neuropathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1aef4c8a0b31ddf10ab37a448fc90808218fa9d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5250666.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27766432/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-016-1631-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MS pathogenesis","MS research","different models","important aspects of MS pathology","key features of MS","Viral models","Toxic models","MS-specific virus infection","important role","different aspects of inflammation","Current EAE models","complex pathogenesis","right experimental model","single experimental model","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","introduction of experimental studies","propagating inflammation","multiple sclerosis","different variations","suitable model","T-cells","remyelination","demyelinating autoimmune disease","clinical trials","pathological data","role of viruses","specific questions","immunological features","inflammatory demyelination","direct virus","relevance of results","mechanisms of de-","immune-mediated mechanisms","tissue damage","entire spectrum","neurodegeneration","CD8","B-lymphocytes","central nervous system","frequent statements","reactive CD4","evidence","reasons"],"language":"en"},

The goal of this review is to discuss acute and chronic cough syndromes caused by non-asthmatic airway diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute cough syndrome is short-lived and self-limited. Acute bronchitis and diffuse acute infectious bronchiolitis (DAIB) are examples. The former is usually caused by a viral illness; the latter by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza, and Haemophilus influenzae. Causes of chronic cough in the adult include chronic bronchitis, non-infectious bronchiolitis, and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. SUMMARY: Supportive measures are recommended for acute bronchitis and antibiotic use is discouraged. Antibiotics may be needed for DAIB. Smoking cessation and bronchodilators can control cough in chronic bronchitis. Therapeutic approaches for non-infectious bronchiolitis depend on the varied etiology. The hallmark of bronchiectasis is a chronic infection of the airways, and antibiotics, mucus clearance measures, and bronchodilators are all supportive.","publish_time":"2019-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braman, Sidney S.; Poor, Armeen","journal":"Curr Otorhinolaryngol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fc825096e41e0e9ad8256583ec9f103ae836e16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100269.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40136-019-00238-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226660/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus"],"organizations":["DAIB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Acute bronchitis","chronic bronchitis","Acute cough syndrome","chronic cough syndromes","chronic infection","non-infectious bronchiolitis","diffuse acute infectious bronchiolitis","bronchodilators","airways","Supportive measures","Antibiotics","DAIB","mucus clearance measures","non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis","hallmark of bronchiectasis","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","excessive mucus","non-asthmatic airway diseases","adult","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","RECENT FINDINGS","pathologic reflex","Haemophilus influenzae","Therapeutic approaches","varied etiology","examples","Smoking cessation","antibiotic use","viral illness","SUMMARY","goal"],"language":"en"},

In nearly every published case report of attempted therapy for clinical FIP, glucocorticoids have been used; there are, however, no controlled studies that evaluate the effect of glucocorticoids as a therapy for FIP. Some veterinarians prescribe immune modulators to treat cats with FIP with no documented controlled evidence of efficacy. It has been suggested that these agents may benefit infected animals by restoring compromised immune function, thereby allowing the patient to control viral burden and recover from clinical signs.

In order to enhance the power of GWAS or whole genome sequencing to identify strong genetic associations, a decision was made to positively select for resistance over three generations. The inbreeding experiment began with a genetically related parental (P) population consisting of three toms and four queens identified from among the survivors of the earlier study and belonging to a closely related subgroup (B). The subsequent effects of inbreeding were measured using 42 genome-wide STR markers. P generation cats produced 57 first filial (F1) kittens, only five of which (9.0%) demonstrated a natural resistance to FIPV infection. One of these five F1 survivors was then used to produce six F1/P-backcrosses kittens, only one of which proved resistant to FIP.

Few existing targeted medications are available. Lianhuaqingwen (LH) capsule, a repurposed marketed Chinese herb product, has been proven effective for influenza. Purpose To determine the safety and efficacy of LH capsule in patients with Covid-19. Methods We did a prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial on LH capsule in confirmed cases with Covid-19. Patients were randomized to receive usual treatment alone or in combination with LH capsules (4 capsules, thrice daily) for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of symptom (fever, fatigue, coughing) recovery. Results We included 284 patients (142 each in treatment and control group) in the full-analysis set. The recovery rate was significantly higher in treatment group as compared with control group (91.5% vs. 82.4%, P=0.022). The median time to symptom recovery was markedly shorter in treatment group (median: 7 vs. 10 days, P\u003C0.001).

After 14 hours in the open area of the emergency department and 2 hemodialysis sessions he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV. One hundred twenty contacts who had direct unprotected exposure were screened. Among those contacts, 9 out of 107 health care workers (5 nurses, 3 physicians, and 1 paramedic) and 7 out of 13 patients tested positive for MERS-CoV. Conclusions This hospital outbreak demonstrated the difficulties in diagnosing pneumonia in patients with renal and cardiac failure, which leads to delayed suspicion of MERS-CoV and hence delay in applying the proper infection control procedures. In MERS-CoV endemic countries there is an urgent need for developing rapid point-of-care testing that would assist emergency department staff in triaging suspected cases of MERS-CoV to ensure timely isolation and management of their primary illness and prevent major MERS-CoV outbreaks.","publish_time":"2018-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amer, Hala; Alqahtani, Abdulrahman S.; Alzoman, Hind; Aljerian, Nawfal; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ea18d0f1f48881cc0a582309845fd56b92fd88e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29661625/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655318301469; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2018.02.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655318301469","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["King Saud Medical City"],"locations":["Middle East","Riyadh"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV superspreader","major MERS-CoV outbreaks","CoV infection","MERS-CoV endemic countries","triaging suspected cases of MERS","delayed suspicion of MERS","fatal cases","total reported cases","major health care","health care facilities","massive numbers of cases","health care workers","acute renal failure","care testing","cardiac failure","patients","King Saud Medical City","Riyadh","contacts","emergency department staff","single superspreader patient","nosocomial outbreaks","hemodialysis sessions","recent multihospital outbreak","proper infection control procedures","hallmark of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Saudi Arabia","difficulties","superspreading events","diagnosing pneumonia","primary illness","urgent need","timely isolation","simultaneous clusters","rapid point","excessive morbidity","management","disease","ability","open area","nurses","physicians","direct unprotected exposure","Conclusions","mortality","hours","Material","Results","paramedic"],"language":"en"},

The Schiff base was synthesized from 2-aminoethanesulphonic acid and 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde under lemon juice catalyzed conditions while the nanoparticles were obtained by careful stirring of sugarcane sap and 1mM AgNO3 in the ratio of 1:10 respectively at room temperature. The resulting nanocomplex was formed by gentle heating and stirring of the silver nanoparticles solution and the ligand at a temperature of about 80\u00B0C for 3h. The ligand, nanoparticles and nanocomplex were characterized using UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer, scanning electron microscope, FT-IR and XRD machines. From the UV\u2013vis results, surface plasmon bands (SPBs) were observed at 475nm for the nanoparticle within 1h of the reaction and 450nm for the nanocomplex. The ligand exhibited absorption bands at 310nm, 280nm and 230nm which are due to \u03C0-electron transitions within the chromophores. The strikingly broad nature of the SPBs especially in the nanoparticles revealed that the particles are kinetically favored, nucleate easily and are polydispersed and the blue shift observed in the nanocomplex suggested further reduction in the particle size therefore giving us a clue on how to tailor the products by tuning the raw materials. From the scanning electron micrographs, the morphologies and growth mechanisms revealed oriented attachment for the nanoparticles onwards digestive ripening for the nanocomplex. All the synthesized materials proved to be potential antibacterial agents as they showed great inhibition to the growth of some bacterial strains with the activity enhanced in the nanocomplex.","publish_time":"2016-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elemike, Elias Emeka; Dare, Enock Olugbenga; Samuel, Inyang David; Onwuka, Jude Chinedu","journal":"Journal of Applied Research and Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2adf2cec87c454060b8d160809abb6cb4442879.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S166564231600002X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S166564231600002X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["XRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nm","resulting nanocomplex","ligand","silver nanoparticles solution","electron microscope","UV","SPBs","scanning electron micrographs","synthesized materials","careful stirring of sugarcane sap","\u03C0-electron transitions","growth mechanisms","vis results","vis spectrophotometer","absorption bands","aminoethanesulphonic acid","raw materials","room temperature","surface plasmon bands","ethane sulphonic acid","morphologies","oriented attachment","dimethoxybenzaldehyde","FT-IR","potential antibacterial agents","lemon juice catalyzed conditions","great inhibition","gentle heating","digestive ripening","dimethoxybenzyl","reaction","XRD machines","bacterial strains","particle size","present investigation","imino","clue","products","chromophores","AgNO3","activity","reduction","Abstract","broad nature","blue shift","Schiff base","ratio"],"language":"en"},

The aims of this study were to assess the effect of CQ and other common antimalarial drugs on B19V infection in vitro and the possible epidemiological consequences for children from Papua New Guinea (PNG). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Viral RNA, DNA and proteins were analyzed in different cell types following infection with B19V in the presence of a range of antimalarial drugs. Relationships between B19V infection status, prior 4-aminoquinoline use and anemia were assessed in 200 PNG children \u003C10 years of age participating in a case-control study of severe infections. In CQ-treated cells, the synthesis of viral RNA, DNA and proteins was significantly higher and occurred earlier than in control cells. CQ facilitates B19V infection by minimizing intracellular degradation of incoming particles. Only amodiaquine amongst other antimalarial drugs had a similar effect. B19V IgM seropositivity was more frequent in 111 children with severe anemia (hemoglobin \u003C50 g/L) than in 89 healthy controls (15.3% vs 3.4%; P = 0.008). In children who were either B19V IgM or PCR positive, 4-aminoquinoline use was associated with a significantly lower admission hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data strongly suggest that 4-aminoquinoline drugs and their metabolites exacerbate B19V-associated anemia by promoting B19V replication. Consideration should be given for choosing a non-4-aminoquinoline drug to partner artemisinin compounds in combination antimalarial therapy.","publish_time":"2010-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00F6nsch, Claudia; Kempf, Christoph; Mueller, Ivo; Manning, Laurens; Laman, Moses; Davis, Timothy M.

We show here that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of N protein from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a virus most closely related to SARS-CoV, employs aromatic amino acid-nucleobase stacking interactions with a triple adenosine motif to mediate high-affinity binding to single-stranded RNAs containing the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) or its complement (cTRS). Stoichiometric NTD fully unwinds a TRS-cTRS duplex that mimics a transiently formed transcription intermediate in viral subgenomic RNA synthesis. Mutation of the solvent-exposed Y127, positioned on the \u03B2-platform surface of our 1.75 \u00C5 structure, binds the TRS far less tightly and is severely crippled in its RNA unwinding activity. In contrast, the C-terminal domain (CTD) exhibits no RNA unwinding activity. Viruses harboring Y127A N mutation are strongly selected against and Y127A N does not support an accessory function in MHV replication. We propose that the helix melting activity of the coronavirus N protein NTD plays a critical accessory role in subgenomic RNA synthesis and other processes requiring RNA remodeling.","publish_time":"2009-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grossoehme, Nicholas E.; Li, Lichun; Keane, Sarah C.; Liu, Pinghua; Dann, Charles E.; Leibowitz, Julian L.; Giedroc, David P.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29f98833b60e4b598dfca82ba2fb95c83a80f7e0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e611d4bf18a935508a12483b22fae7540b2a7c49.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5dd019119ab7f5238d2e0ec210d1cd77b9336daa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2783395.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.09.040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228360901167X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002228360901167X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19782089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","TRS","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA remodeling","N-terminal domain","Y127A N mutation","coronavirus N protein NTD","viral subgenomic RNA synthesis","characterized RNA binding properties","activity","independent RNA binding domains of known structure","Stoichiometric NTD","TRS-cTRS duplex","high-affinity binding","C-terminal domain","accessory function","\u00C5 structure","SARS-CoV","MHV replication","critical accessory role","mouse hepatitis virus","interactions","single-stranded RNAs","causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","formed transcription","aromatic amino acid-nucleobase","triple adenosine motif","transcriptional regulatory sequence","CTD","processes","\u03B2-platform surface","solvent-exposed Y127","CoVs","contrast","complement","helix","nucleocapsid","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

The diversity of this virus has been verified by sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, but this method must be supplemented with further analysis for characterization of the agent. To increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease caused by this virus, we investigated the response of chickens to 2 IBV with different genotypes, KIIa and ChVI. The clinical signs induced by the viruses were observed. In addition, the mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1\u03B2, and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 factor and the serum levels of \u03B1(1)-acid glycoprotein, which is a major acute phase protein, were measured. The KIIa genotype (Kr/ADL110002/2011) induced clinical signs accompanied by the excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a higher viral load. In chickens infected with this isolate, simultaneous peaks in the viral copy number and cytokine production were observed at 7 dpi in the trachea and 9 d postinoculation in the kidney. On the other hand, the chickens infected with the ChVI genotype (Kr/ADL120003/2012) did not show a response other than a mild upregulation of cytokines at 1 d postinoculation, which appears to indicate the invasion of the virus.

Methods A panel of international experts from ASTRO, ESTRO and select Asia-Pacific countries completed a modified rapid Delphi process. Questions and topics were presented to the group, and subsequent questions developed from iterative feedback. Each survey was open online for 24 hours, and successive rounds started within 24 hours of the previous round. The chosen cutoffs for strong agreement (\u226580%) and agreement (\u226566%) were extrapolated from the RAND methodology. Two pandemic scenarios: early (risk mitigation) and late (severely reduced radiotherapy resources) were evaluated. The panel developed treatment recommendations for five HNC cases. Results In total, 29/31 (94%) of those invited accepted, and after a replacement 30/30 completed all three surveys (100% response rate). There was agreement or strong agreement across a number of practice areas including: treatment prioritisation, whether to delay initiation or interrupt radiotherapy for intercurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, approaches to treatment (radiation dose-fractionation schedules and use of chemotherapy in each pandemic scenario), management of surgical cases in event of operating room closures, and recommended adjustments to outpatient clinic appointments and supportive care. Conclusions This urgent practice recommendation was issued in the knowledge of the very difficult circumstances in which our patients find themselves at present, navigating strained health care systems functioning with limited resources and at heightened risk to their health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this consensus statement is to ensure high-quality HNC treatments continue, to save lives and for symptomatic benefit.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomson, David J.; Palma, David; Guckenberger, Matthias; Balermpas, Panagiotis; Beitler, Jonathan J.; Blanchard, Pierre; Brizel, David; Budach, Wilfred; Caudell, Jimmy; Corry, June; Corvo, Renzo; Evans, Mererid; Garden, Adam S.; Giralt, Jordi; Gregoire, Vincent; Harari, Paul M.; Harrington, Kevin; Hitchcock, Ying J.; Johansen, Jorgen; Kaanders, Johannes; Koyfman, Shlomo; Langendijk, J.

This study also extended the model of goal-directed behavior (MGB) by incorporating the new concepts of NPI, and the perception of 2009 H1N1. The model found that desire, perceived behavioral control, frequency of past behavior, and non-pharmaceutical interventions predicted tourists\u2019 intention but perceptions of 2009 H1N1 had nil effect on desire and intention. Personal non-pharmaceutical interventions were theorized as adaptive behavior of tourists intending to travel during a pandemic which should be supported by tourism operators on a system-wide basis. Practically, this study dealt with the issue of influenza 2009 H1N1 with the study findings and implications providing government agencies, tourism marketers, policy-makers, transport systems, and hospitality services with important suggestions for NPI and international tourism during pandemics.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Choong-Ki; Song, Hak-Jun; Bendle, Lawrence J.; Kim, Myung-Ja; Han, Heesup","journal":"Tourism Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7cc0d31bcba431cf8dbb9d2929f8589b04efecc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115461.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517711000501; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517711000501; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2011.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287736/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["international tourism","H1N1","tourism marketers","tourism context","tourism operators","impact of NPI","study findings","new concepts of NPI","Personal non-pharmaceutical interventions","new concept of non-pharmaceutical intervention","tourists\u2019 intention","behavioral intention of potential international tourists","adaptive behavior of tourists","desire","frequency of past behavior","behavioral control","issue of influenza","model of goal","government agencies","implications","perceptions","policy-makers","hospitality services","important suggestions","transport systems","nil effect","MGB","system-wide basis","pandemics"],"language":"en"},

We summarize what is currently known about gB from two closely related herpesviruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2, with emphasis on the structure of the largely uncharted membrane interacting regions of this fusogen.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was needed to treat H7N9 induced ARDS at the time. MSCs transplant into patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were conducted in a single center and open-label clinical trial. Based on the principle of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were included as a control group while 17 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were served as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual blood-derived MSC. Notably, MSC transplantation significantly lower the mortality compared with in control group (17.6% died in MSC group vs 54.5% died in control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in human body within the 5 year follow up period with 4 patients. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies.

To verify the precise route of infection for the case, we conducted an in-depth epidemiological investigation in cooperation with the KCDC. METHODS: We reviewed the MERS outbreak investigation report of the KCDC, and interviewed the healthcare worker who had recovered from MERS. Using the media interview data, we reaffirmed and supplemented the nature of the exposure. RESULTS: The healthcare worker, a nurse, was infected while performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a MERS patient in an isolation room. During the CPR which lasted for an hour, a large amount of body fluid was splashed. The nurse was presumed to have touched the mask to adjust its position during the CPR. She suggested that she was contaminated with the MERS patient\u2019s body fluids by wiping away the sweat from her face during the CPR. CONCLUSIONS: The possible routes of infection may include the following: respiratory invasion of aerosols contaminated with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) through a gap between the face and mask; mucosal exposure to sweat contaminated with MERS-CoV; and contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment. The MERS guidelines should reflect this case to decrease the risk of infection during CPR.","publish_time":"2017-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nam, Hae-Sung; Yeon, Mi-Yeon; Park, Jung Wan; Hong, Jee-Young; Son, Ji Woong","journal":"Epidemiol Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7e0c619c9f078101beffb8b3822c65e95995856.json; document_parses/pdf_json/165cfcb6f439f6d779d1e94b0b8a3db96c79b22e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5733382.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29129042/; https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2017052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KCDC","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Korea","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["case of MERS","MERS-CoV","MERS-coronavirus","MERS guidelines","CPR","MERS outbreak investigation report","MERS patient\u2019s body fluids","KCDC","healthcare worker","Korea Centers","South Korea","risk of infection","mask","face","nurse","sweat","possible routes of infection","precise route of infection","mucosal exposure","respiratory invasion of aerosols","in-depth epidemiological investigation","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","contamination","Prevention","following","Disease Control","Daejeon","doffing of personal protective equipment","cooperation","cardiopulmonary resuscitation","gap","CONCLUSIONS","isolation room","hour","media interview data","position","RESULTS","METHODS","nature","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

These factors increase the risk of the spread of infectious diseases by air travel. Little is known, however, about the extent to which airlines provide information to passengers on infection control and measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This study examined the websites of the global commercial passenger airlines to see if they contained information about infection control and prevention of infectious diseases and appraised the clinical usefulness of that information. Method A cross-sectional text-based analysis of the 73 airline websites from the six global commercial passenger airline conglomerates was performed to identify information about infection control and prevention of infectious between July and August 2019. Results Of the 73 airline websites, less than half (n = 35, 28.6%) contained information deemed useful for passengers. While there was a range of general health advice within the websites, there was limited information about infection control and preventing infectious diseases. A minority of websites contained information about vaccination status prior to travel, and to a lesser extent handwashing and hand hygiene, with very few including disease-specific advice or preventive measures. Conclusions Airline websites are an underutilised source of information for infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases. Providing passengers with information on basic infection control and prevention measures may support the global efforts against the spread of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaban, Ramon Z.; Sotomayor-Castillo, Cristina F.; Malik, Jeremy; Li, Cecilia","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50efa168a690323ca0f0912288e1892a695ff0e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110852.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31760126/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.101528; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893919302315; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893919302315","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Air"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevention of infectious diseases","spread of infectious diseases","limited information","basic infection control","underutilised source of information","Conclusions Airline websites","prevention measures","minority of websites","passengers","global commercial passenger airline conglomerates","global commercial passenger airlines","global efforts","preventive measures","Abstract Background Air travel","disease-specific advice","lesser extent handwashing","range of general health advice","cross-sectional text-based analysis","hand hygiene","vaccination status","Method","risk","clinical usefulness","large volumes of people","half","world","factors","study","Results"],"language":"en"},

It is anticipated that there will be a substantive fraction of patients who will be contagious, but asymptomatic at the time of surgery. Use multimodal perioperative infection control practices (e.g., including patient decontamination) and monitor performance (e.g., S. aureus transmission from patient to the environment). The consequence of COVID-19 is that such processes are more important than ever to follow because infection affects not only patients but the surgery center staff and surgeons. Dedicate most operating rooms to procedures that are not airway aerosol producing and can be performed without general anesthesia. Increase throughput by performing nerve blocks before patients enter the operating rooms. Bypass the phase I post-anesthesia care unit whenever possible by appropriate choices of anesthetic approach and drugs. Plan long-duration workdays (e.g., 12-h). For cases where the surgical procedure does not cause aerosol production, but general anesthesia will be used, have initial (phase I) post-anesthesia recovery in the operating room where the surgery was done. Use anesthetic practices that achieve fast initial recovery of the brief ambulatory cases. When the surgical procedure causes aerosol production (e.g., bronchoscopy), conduct phase I recovery in the operating room and use multimodal environmental decontamination after each case. Use statistical methods to plan for the resulting long turnover times. Whenever possible, have the anesthesia and nursing teams stagger cases in more than one room so that they are doing one surgical case while the other room is being cleaned. In conclusion, this review shows that while COVID-19 is prevalent, it will markedly affect daily ambulatory workflow for patients undergoing general anesthesia, with potentially substantial economic impact for some surgical specialties.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dexter, Franklin; Elhakim, Mohamed; Loftus, Randy W.; Seering, Melinda S.; Epstein, Richard H.","journal":"J Clin Anesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/502f56b38b42bb84ac0c966f45d61ed1d82c7eb4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/27bfd864480d3a0022b437ad1ebaace2b89de116.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188624.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2020.109854; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952818020306176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371331/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952818020306176?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["general anesthesia","post-anesthesia recovery","operating rooms","surgical procedure","surgical case","ambulatory surgery centers","economics of daily operating room management decisions","post-anesthesia care unit","acute phase","aerosol production","time of surgery","surgical specialties","brief ambulatory cases","daily ambulatory workflow","fast initial recovery","anesthetic practices","patient decontamination","surgery center staff","substantive fraction of patients","airway aerosol","consequence of COVID","Plan","multimodal environmental decontamination","multimodal perioperative infection control practices","nursing teams stagger cases","narrative review","appropriate choices of anesthetic approach","resulting long turnover times","resolution","substantial economic impact","aureus transmission","monitor performance","nerve blocks","drugs","Coronavirus Disease","procedures","bronchoscopy","surgeons","throughput","statistical methods","duration workdays","processes","conclusion","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Upper respiratory specimens (throat and/or nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Period of viral infection and the contagious stage were analyzed. Results Of 301 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 58 years and 51.2% were male. The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, N = 301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; N = 216). Infected patient \u226565 years old stayed contagious longer (22 days vs 19 days, p = 0.015). Although two consecutive negative results were confirmed in 70 patients, 30% of them had positive viral test results for the third time. Using specimens from nasal swabs to run the RT-PCR test showed a higher positive rate than using specimens from throat swabs. Conclusions This large-scale investigation with 1113 RT-PCR test results from 301 COVID-19 patients showed that the average contagious period of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 20 days. Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients \u226565 years.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Ai Tang; Tong, Yi Xin; Gao, Chun; Zhu, Li; Zhang, Yu Jie; Zhang, Sheng","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbda64bc03cf420c886826a11264b1e1c5311875.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151472.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361324/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220300883; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220300883?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tongji Hospital"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["RT-PCR results","RT-PCR test results","infected patients","positive SARS-CoV","positive viral test results","Period of viral infection","median period","real-time RT-PCR","viral detection results","effective negative SARS-CoV","average contagious period of SARS","consecutive negative results","series of negative viral test","days vs","confirmed COVID","hospitalized COVID","Longer observation period","throat swabs","nasal swabs","symptoms presence","contagious stage","IQR","Upper respiratory specimens","years old","median age","higher positive rate","spread of Coronavirus Disease","disease course","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","different timepoints","Tongji Hospital","large-scale investigation","Wuhan","retrospective study","Abstract Background","China","Methods","Conclusions","society","Demographic characteristics","male"],"language":"en"},

The innate immune system offers alternative mechanisms that do not require antigen-specific recognition or a priori knowledge of the causative agent. However, it is unclear whether effective stable innate immune system activation can be achieved without triggering harmful autoimmunity or other chronic inflammatory sequelae. Here, we show that transgenic expression of a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in the absence of other viral proteins, can profoundly reconfigure mammalian innate antiviral immunity by exposing the normally membrane-sequestered RdRP activity to sustained innate immune detection. RdRP-transgenic mice have life-long, quantitatively dramatic upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and show profound resistance to normally lethal viral challenge. Multiple crosses with defined knockout mice (Rag1, Mda5, Mavs, Ifnar1, Ifngr1, and Tlr3) established that the mechanism operates via MDA5 and MAVS and is fully independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cell models recapitulated the key features with striking fidelity, with the RdRP inducing an analogous ISG network and a strict block to HIV-1 infection. This RdRP-mediated antiviral mechanism does not depend on secondary structure within the RdRP mRNA but operates at the protein level and requires RdRP catalysis. Importantly, despite lifelong massive ISG elevations, RdRP mice are entirely healthy, with normal longevity. Our data reveal that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration. These results provide a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection.","publish_time":"2015-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Painter, Meghan M.; Morrison, James H.; Zoecklein, Laurie J.; Rinkoski, Tommy A.; Watzlawik, Jens O.; Papke, Louisa M.; Warrington, Arthur E.; Bieber, Allan J.; Matchett, William E.; Turkowski, Kari L.; Poeschla, Eric M.; Rodriguez, Moses","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59b1eae28c32b9852ebe3707da0e9c469e9ea2dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4669089.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26633895/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005311","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAVS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RdRP mice","RdRP mRNA","RdRP catalysis","innate immunity","RdRP-transgenic mice","innate immune detection","adaptive immune system","immune system configuration","effective stable innate immune system activation","antiviral immunity","membrane-sequestered RdRP activity","antiviral mechanism","sterilizing adaptive immunity","Mavs","augmented MDA5-mediated activation state","defined knockout mice","broad-spectrum antiviral protection","viral proteins","transgenic expression","picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","well-tolerated mammalian","analogous ISG network","lethal viral challenge","lifelong massive ISG elevations","Rag1","definitive solutions","key features","strict block","infectious diseases","profound resistance","knowledge","interferon-stimulated genes","ISGs","Ifnar1","alternative mechanisms","dramatic upregulation","harmful autoimmunity","Multiple crosses","striking fidelity","Human cell models","protein level","secondary structure","chronic inflammatory sequelae","antigen-specific recognition","HIV","Ifngr1","years","infection","Tlr3","data reveal","decades","absence","foundation","causative agent","normal longevity","results"],"language":"en"},

However, subunit vaccines have not been successfully commercialized mainly due to the lack of sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAs). High levels of NA rely on the efficient recognition and cross-linking of multiple neutralizing epitopes with B-cell receptors (BCRs). Nanoparticles are able to display coupled antigenic arrays at high density and provide multiple binding molecular scenarios with BCRs. The high-resolution antigenic structure makes it possible to accurately display stable neutralizing epitopes. Therefore, the development of a nanovaccine that orientationally displays neutralizing epitopes is a feasible strategy. To address this hypothesis, the capsid (Cap) protein of porcine circovirus type 2 as model antigen was conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through direct reaction of the mercapto group of the unique cysteines with AuNPs, rendering Cap-AuNPs to have neutralizing epitopes on outer surface and an immunodominant epitope buried within the inner surface. In vitro studies showed that AuNPs promoted the phagocytosis of Cap protein and NA levels were significantly improved, meanwhile antibody levels against the immunodominant epitope was significantly reduced. In mouse studies, Cap-AuNP-immunized mice displayed a high production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and interferon-\u03B3, suggesting that Cap-AuNPs can effectively activate CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells and balance Th1 and Th2 cellular responses. This study presents a new vaccine design strategy based on antigen structure, where nanoparticles are coupled to antigens in well-ordered arrays and orientationally display neutralizing epitopes to enhance NA levels.","publish_time":"2017-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Peiyang; Zhang, Teng; Li, Yafei; Teng, Man; Sun, Yaning; Liu, Xiao; Chai, Shujun; Zhou, Enmin; Jin, Qianyue; Zhang, Gaiping","journal":"Int J Nanomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7bf3bca72a759d1b1c4b003ce431ee58d0dbe27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5533572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28769561/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s140789","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cap-AuNPs","multiple neutralizing epitopes","stable neutralizing epitopes","orientationally display neutralizing epitopes","NA levels","High levels of NA","antibody levels","lack of sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies","phagocytosis of Cap protein","high density","antigen structure","gold nanoparticles","coupled antigenic arrays","immunodominant epitope","BCRs","IL","high production of interleukin","high-resolution antigenic structure","well-ordered arrays","model antigen","outer surface","feasible strategy","inner surface","mouse studies","Th2 cellular responses","protective immune responses","multiple binding molecular scenarios","protein of porcine circovirus type","new vaccine design strategy","subsequent expression of pathogenic microbial major antigens","rapid identification","balance Th1","immunized mice","T cells","mercapto group","B-cell receptors","direct reaction","unique cysteines","efficient recognition","biotechnology","study","capsid","NAs","CD8","interferon-\u03B3","CD4","nanovaccine","Recent advancements","hypothesis","subunit vaccines","development"],"language":"en"},

As obligate parasites, viruses exploit host-cell machinery to glycosylate their own proteins during replication. Viral envelope proteins from a variety of human pathogens including HIV-1, influenza virus, Lassa virus, SARS, Zika virus, dengue virus, and Ebola virus have evolved to be extensively glycosylated. These host-cell derived glycans facilitate diverse structural and functional roles during the viral life-cycle, ranging from immune evasion by glycan shielding to enhancement of immune cell infection. In this review, we highlight the imperative and auxiliary roles glycans play, and how specific oligosaccharide structures facilitate these functions during viral pathogenesis. We discuss the growing efforts to exploit viral glycobiology in the development of anti-viral vaccines and therapies.","publish_time":"2019-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watanabe, Yasunori; Bowden, Thomas A.; Wilson, Ian A.; Crispin, Max","journal":"Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aac7a557d56de4ec3180fec38514eec284d03e0e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/313d6762ff0c7e18ed7af39482b04fbd2d280bc7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6686077.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416519301333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121217/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304416519301333; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.05.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","dengue virus","Lassa virus","Zika virus","Ebola virus","viral glycobiology","viral pathogenesis","Viral envelope proteins","viral life-cycle","functional roles","host-cell derived glycans","development of anti-viral vaccines","host-cell machinery","auxiliary roles glycans play","enhancement of immune cell infection","multitude of crucial biological roles","immune evasion","SARS","ubiquitous post-translational modification responsible","specific oligosaccharide structures","variety of human pathogens","functions","HIV","viruses","Glycosylation","therapies","obligate parasites","growing efforts","review","replication"],"language":"en"},

Virus isolation is used to demonstrate infectious virus in a patient\u0027s specimens, whereas nucleic acid amplification techniques, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are widely used to detect virus nucleic acids.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for the screening of suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection in patients who have developed pneumonia. Methods A two-center, retrospective case\u2013control study was performed. A total of 360 patients with confirmed pneumonia who were evaluated for MERS-CoV infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) between September 1, 2012 and June 1, 2016 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh and King Fahad General Hospital in Jeddah, were included. According to the rRT-PCR results, 135 patients were positive for MERS-CoV and 225 were negative. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, and radiological and laboratory findings were collected for each subject. Results A risk prediction model to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV was developed. The model included male sex, contact with a sick patient or camel, diabetes, severe illness, low white blood cell (WBC) count, low alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The model performed well in predicting MERS-CoV infection (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) 0.8162), on internal validation (AUC 0.8037), and on a goodness-of-fit test (p =0.592). The risk prediction model, which produced an optimal probability cut-off of 0.33, had a sensitivity of 0.716 and specificity of 0.783. Conclusions This study provides a simple, practical, and valid algorithm to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. This risk prediction model could be useful for the early identification of patients at the highest risk of MERS-CoV infection. Further validation of the prediction model on a large prospective cohort of representative patients with pneumonia is necessary.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Anwar E.; Al-Jahdali, Hamdan; Alshukairi, Abeer N.; Alaqeel, Mody; Siddiq, Salma S.; Alsaab, Hanan; Sakr, Ezzeldin A.; Alyahya, Hamed A.; Alandonisi, Munzir M.; Subedar, Alaa T.; Aloudah, Nouf M.; Baharoon, Salim; Alsalamah, Majid A.; Al Johani, Sameera; Alghamdi, Mohammed G.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65556a1c9046ca8dcde2c83900c2238426c29765.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110544.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29550445/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2018.03.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197121830064X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197121830064X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["King Abdulaziz Medical City"],"locations":["Middle East","Jeddah"],"keyphrases":["risk prediction model","pneumonia patients","increased risk of MERS","predicting MERS-CoV infection","highest risk of MERS","early identification of patients","confirmed pneumonia","screening of suspected cases of MERS","large prospective cohort of representative patients","high risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","rRT-PCR results","control study","AUC","low alanine aminotransferase","high aspartate aminotransferase","King Abdulaziz Medical City","characteristics curves","Demographic characteristics","internal validation","accurate identification of individuals","low white blood cell","King Fahad General Hospital","count","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","Riyadh","WBC","severe illness","diabetes","ALT","area","receiver","clinical presentations","valid algorithm","major challenge","sick patient","camel","center","laboratory findings","retrospective case","Abstract Background","Jeddah","scientific communities","male sex","optimal probability cut-off","fit test","total","sensitivity","goodness","subject","Methods","Conclusions","specificity","aim"],"language":"en"},

Disrupted mucus production is a cardinal feature of chronic respiratory diseases but how this alteration affect interactions between mucins and pathogens is complex and poorly understood. Here, we identify a central and unexpected role for the major airway mucin MUC5AC in pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Virus induction of MUC5AC is augmented in COPD compared to healthy subjects, is enhanced in frequent exacerbators and correlates with inflammation, symptom severity and secondary bacterial infection during exacerbation. MUC5AC is functionally related to inflammation as MUC5AC-deficient (Muc5ac-/-) mice had attenuated rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation whilst exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein administration augmented virus-induced inflammatory responses and bacterial load. Mechanistically, MUC5AC-augmentation of rhinovirus-induced inflammation occurred through release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Therapeutic suppression of virus-induced MUC5AC release using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor ameliorated exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in a mouse COPD exacerbation model. Collectively, these studies demonstrate previously unrecognised pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC during infection and thus highlight a key unforeseen role in driving COPD exacerbation severity.","publish_time":"2019-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singanayagam, Aran; Footitt, Joseph; Kasdorf, Benjamin T; Marczynski, Matthias; Cross, Michael T; Finney, Lydia J; Trujillo Torralbo, Maria-Belen; Calderazzo, Maria; Zhu, Jie; Aniscenko, Julia; Clarke, Thomas B; Molyneaux, Philip L; Bartlett, Nathan W; Moffatt, Miriam F; Cookson, William O; Wedzicha, Jadwiga; Evans, Christopher M; Lieleg, Oliver; Mallia, Patrick; Johnston, Sebastian L","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a04cb2416a367987ad6c3a60e56ab712e07cac0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9c32d461dc9d4737756a990cf13bae1a03e078a9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/706804","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced MUC5AC release","MUC5AC-augmentation","MUC5AC-deficient","Virus induction of MUC5AC","rhinovirus-induced inflammation","major airway mucin MUC5AC","unrecognised pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC","exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein administration augmented virus","attenuated rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation","pathogenesis of virus","driving COPD exacerbation severity","mouse COPD exacerbation model","exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses","Therapeutic suppression of virus","induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","secondary bacterial infection","symptom severity","unexpected role","inhaled pathogens","mucin glycoproteins","bacterial load","cardinal feature of chronic respiratory diseases","key unforeseen role","secreted layer of mucus","Disrupted mucus production","respiratory tract surface","release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate","EGFR","inhibitor","epidermal growth factor receptor","alteration","interactions","frequent exacerbators","correlates","mice","mucins","ATP","studies","healthy subjects"],"language":"en"},

N appears to be a multifunctional protein since data also suggest that the protein may be involved in viral RNA replication and translation. All of these functions presumably involve interactions between N and viral RNAs. As a step toward understanding how N interacts with viral RNAs, we mapped high-efficiency N-binding sites within BCV- and MHV-defective genomes. Both in vivo and in vitro assays were used to study binding of BCV and MHV N proteins to viral and nonviral RNAs. N\u2013viral RNA complexes were detected in bovine coronavirus (BCV)-infected cells and in cells transiently expressing the N protein. Filter binding was used to map N-binding sites within Drep, a BCV-defective genome that is replicated and packaged in the presence of helper virus. One high-efficiency N-binding site was identified between nucleotides 1441 and 1875 at the 3\u2032 end of the N ORF within Drep. For comparative purposes N-binding sites were also mapped for the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV)-defective interfering (DI) RNA MIDI-C. Binding efficiencies similar to those for Drep were measured for RNA transcripts of a region encompassing the MHV packaging signal (nts 3949\u20134524), as well as a region at the 3\u2032 end of the MHV N ORF (nts 4837\u20135197) within MIDI-C. Binding to the full-length MIDI-C transcript (\u223C5500 nts) and to an \u223C1-kb transcript from the gene 1a region (nts 935\u20131986) of MIDI-C that excluded the packaging signal were both significantly higher than that measured for the smaller transcripts. This is the first identification of N-binding sequences for BCV. It is also the first report to demonstrate that N interacts in vitro with sequences other than the packaging signal and leader within the MHV genome. The data clearly demonstrate that N binds coronavirus RNAs more efficiently than nonviral RNAs. The results have implications with regard to the multifunctional role of N.","publish_time":"2000-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cologna, Raymond; Spagnolo, Jeannie F.; Hogue, Brenda G.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/597d89cc2fd0051ce2c08589fab6c7f5ea822e36.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682200906111; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682200906111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCV","MHV N","RNA","MHV","MHV N ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identification of N","MHV N ORF","MHV N proteins","binding of BCV","N binds coronavirus RNAs","high-efficiency N-binding sites","comparative purposes N-binding sites","binding sequences","Filter binding","RNA MIDI-","MHV packaging signal","MHV genome","nts","Binding efficiencies similar","viral RNA complexes","viral RNA replication","RNA transcripts","nonviral RNAs","MHV-defective genomes","BCV-defective genome","genomic RNA","Drep","coronavirus nucleocapsid","multifunctional protein","region","bovine coronavirus","full-length MIDI-C transcript","defective interfering","mouse hepatitis coronavirus","end","data","infected cells","multifunctional role of","helical nucleocapsid","smaller transcripts","major structural component of virions","implications","regard","leader","interactions","gene","translation","presence of helper virus","results","nucleotides","functions","assays","step","report"],"language":"en"},

The PEMS-associated mortality and growth depression is related to malabsorption and decreased metabolic activity caused, in part, by a possible insulin deficiency or insensitivity. Insulin receptors are stimulated by the glucose tolerance factor (GTF) that incorporates Cr. Body Cr deficiency can be exacerbated by dietary deficiency and by increased excretion due to stress associated with a diarrheal disease such as PEMS. BioChrome\u00AE (BC) contains natural, preformed GTF, the bioactive form of Cr. Experiments were conducted in which BC was blended into poult starter feed at 400 ppb during the first 21 d posthatch. Body weights were determined at 1, 7, 14, and 21 d of age, and weekly feed conversions were calculated for each treatment group (control, BC, PEMS, and BC\u002BPEMS). At 6 d post-hatch, each PEMS-designated poult was given a 0.1-mL oral gavage of a 10% suspension of feces from PEMS-infected poults. Blood samples were taken via cardiac puncture from four birds per treatment group at 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21 d of age. Radioimmunoassays were conducted for plasma insulin, glucagon, thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3). Plasma insulin levels were depressed in PEMS-infected poults from Days 10 through 17, but plasma glucagon levels in the PEMS-infected poults were significantly elevated at 14 and 17 d, after which they returned to control levels in both of the PEMS-infected groups. The T3 and T4 levels were depressed through Day 21 in PEMS-infected poults, but with BC treatment these blood hormone levels rebounded by Day 21. Body weights of PEMS-infected poults were increased significantly by the BC treatment but not to the level of noninfected controls.","publish_time":"2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doerfler, R.

They are differentiated by insertions/deletions in the S1 nucleotide sequence of the S gene, and differences in virulence were observed from the clinical cases. In 2014, a PED outbreak occurred in a pig farm in France, from which an InDel strain was isolated. This study aimed at comparing, under experimental conditions, the pathogenicity and the direct and indirect transmissions between a non\u2010InDel strain isolated from a PED\u2010affected piglet in 2014 in the USA and the French InDel strain. All infected pigs showed clinical signs with the non\u2010InDel strain although only the inoculated and direct contact pigs showed clinical signs in the InDel strain group. Although viral RNA was detected in air samples with both strains, the indirect contact pigs remained free from infection with the InDel strain in contrast to the non\u2010InDel group in which airborne transmission occurred in the indirect contact pigs. All infected pigs shed virus in faeces regardless of PEDV strain with 9 of 30 pigs showing intermittent faecal shedding. The transmission rate by direct contact was found to be 2.17\u2010fold higher than the non\u2010InDel strain compared with the InDel. In conclusion, the InDel strain was less pathogenic than the non\u2010InDel strain in our experimental conditions. The transmission route differed between the two strains.

Limitations in adequate diagnosis and therapy reflect an obvious need for further understanding of human epididymal and testicular immunopathologies and their contribution to infertility. A major obstacle for advancing our knowledge is the limited access to suitable tissue samples. Similarly, the key events in the inflammatory or autoimmune pathologies affecting human male fertility are poorly amenable to close examination. Moreover, the disease processes generally have occurred long before the patient attends the clinic for fertility assessment. In this regard, data obtained from experimental animal models and respective comparative analyses have shown promise to overcome these restrictions in humans. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This narrative review will focus on male fertility disturbances caused by infection and inflammation, and the usefulness of the most frequently applied animal models to study these conditions. SEARCH METHODS: An extensive search in Medline database was performed without restrictions until January 2018 using the following search terms: \u2018infection\u2019 and/or \u2018inflammation\u2019 and \u2018testis\u2019 and/or \u2018epididymis\u2019, \u2018infection\u2019 and/or \u2018inflammation\u2019 and \u2018male genital tract\u2019, \u2018male infertility\u2019, \u2018orchitis\u2019, \u2018epididymitis\u2019, \u2018experimental autoimmune\u2019 and \u2018orchitis\u2019 or \u2018epididymitis\u2019 or \u2018epididymo-orchitis\u2019, antisperm antibodies\u2019, \u2018vasectomy\u2019. In addition to that, reference lists of primary and review articles were reviewed for additional publications independently by each author. Selected articles were verified by each two separate authors and discrepancies discussed within the team. OUTCOMES: There is clear evidence that models mimicking testicular and/or epididymal inflammation and infection have been instructive in a better understanding of the mechanisms of disease initiation and progression. In this regard, rodent models of acute bacterial epididymitis best reflect the clinical situation in terms of mimicking the infection pathway, pathogens selected and the damage, such as fibrotic transformation, observed. Similarly, animal models of acute testicular and epididymal inflammation using lipopolysaccharides show impairment of reproduction, endocrine function and histological tissue architecture, also seen in men. Autoimmune responses can be studied in models of experimental autoimmune orchitis (EAO) and vasectomy. In particular, the early stages of EAO development showing inflammatory responses in the form of peritubular lymphocytic infiltrates, thickening of the lamina propria of affected tubules, production of autoantibodies against testicular antigens or secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, replicate observations in testicular sperm extraction samples of patients with \u2018mixed atrophy\u2019 of spermatogenesis. Vasectomy, in the form of sperm antibodies and chronic inflammation, can also be studied in animal models, providing valuable insights into the human response. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: This is the first comprehensive review of rodent models of both infectious and autoimmune disease of testis/epididymis, and their clinical implications, i.e. their importance in understanding male infertility related to infectious and non-infectious/autoimmune disease of the reproductive organs.","publish_time":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fijak, Monika; Pilatz, Adrian; Hedger, Mark P; Nicolas, Nour; Bhushan, Sudhanshu; Michel, Vera; Tung, Kenneth S K; Schuppe, Hans-Christian; Meinhardt, Andreas","journal":"Human Reproduction Update","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f83acd425d071c52a88d93eae28c2e68ea36c13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6016649.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmy009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29648649/; https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-pdf/24/4/416/25080083/dmy009.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["models of experimental autoimmune orchitis","epididymal inflammation","experimental animal models","male infertility","animal models of acute testicular","applied animal models","human male fertility","Autoimmune responses","chronic inflammation","autoimmune disease of testis","comprehensive review of rodent models","autoimmune pathologies","epididymo-orchitis","infection pathway","male genital tract","male fertility disturbances","testicular antigens","testicular immunopathologies","human epididymal","vasectomy","rodent models of acute bacterial epididymitis","significant causes of male factor infertility","inflammatory responses","reproductive tract","review articles","disease processes","testicular sperm extraction samples of patients","urinary tract pathogens","narrative review","fertility assessment","human response","mechanisms of disease initiation","extensive search","SEARCH METHODS","following search terms","clinical implications","regard","epididymis","epididymitis\u2019","better understanding","Selected articles","restrictions","suitable tissue samples","form of sperm antibodies","secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators","clinical situation","reproductive organs","contributory factor","WIDER IMPLICATIONS","histological tissue architecture","frequent aetiology of epididymo","early stages of EAO development","form of peritubular lymphocytic infiltrates","observations","lipopolysaccharides","endocrine function","production of autoantibodies","impairment of reproduction","transmitted bacteria","lamina propria of affected tubules","knowledge","therapy","limited access","obvious need","haematogenous dissemination","valuable insights","respective comparative analyses","reference lists of primary","adequate diagnosis","mixed atrophy","Medline database","damage","additional publications","antisperm antibodies\u2019","clear evidence","contribution","importance","usefulness","close examination","key events","discrepancies","Limitations","Ascending infections","separate authors","OBJECTIVE","RATIONALE","progression","conditions","team","fibrotic transformation","major obstacle","spermatogenesis","OUTCOMES","BACKGROUND","humans"],"language":"en"},

The GP73 cDNA was cloned by differential screening of a cDNA library derived from the liver of a patient with adult giant-cell hepatitis (GCH), a rare form of hepatitis with presumed viral etiology. In vitro transcription\u2013translation studies indicate that GP73 is an integral membrane protein, and immunolocalization experiments using epitope-tagged GP73 demonstrate that the protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus. Northern blot analysis of RNA from multiple human tissues reveals a single GP73 mRNA transcript with a size of approximately 3.0kb. Immunohistochemical studies using rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against recombinant GP73 demonstrate that the protein is preferentially expressed by epithelial cells in many human tissues. In normal livers, GP73 is consistently present in biliary epithelial cells, whereas hepatocytes show little or no signal. In contrast, livers of patients with GCH display strong GP73 immunoreactivity in multinucleated hepatocytes. GP73 mRNA and protein are expressed in highly differentiated HepG2 hepatoma cells after infection with adenovirus in vitro. We conclude that GP73 represents a novel, epithelial cell-specific integral membrane Golgi protein that can be upregulated in response to viral infection.","publish_time":"2000-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kladney, Raleigh D.; Bulla, Gary A.; Guo, Linsheng; Mason, Andrew L.; Tollefson, Ann E.; Simon, Daniela J.; Koutoubi, Zaher; Fimmel, Claus J.","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94ec230c7dbd539648f1e44b49b4fa4f7cd2cf1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127640.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111900001360; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111900001360","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GCH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GP73 cDNA","recombinant GP73","characterization of GP73","strong GP73 immunoreactivity","single GP73 mRNA transcript","integral membrane protein","kDa human Golgi protein","epithelial cell-specific integral membrane Golgi protein","biliary epithelial cells","GCH","multiple human tissues","novel","viral infection","Golgi apparatus","adult giant-cell hepatitis","differentiated HepG2 hepatoma cells","multinucleated hepatocytes","Immunohistochemical studies","livers of patients","cDNA library","translation studies","normal livers","rare form of hepatitis","presumed viral etiology","rabbit polyclonal antisera","immunolocalization experiments","Northern blot analysis of RNA","differential screening","adenovirus","size","epitope","contrast","transcription","response","signal","isolation"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: There was fair (Single Rapid, j=0\u00B7434) to good (Triple Rapid, j =0\u00B7797) agreement with the reference tests. At this study\u0027s prevalence (59 to 61%), specificities and PPV were high (1\u00B700) with both Rapid tests, but sensitivities and NPV were lower for the Single than for the Triple (0\u00B748 vs 0\u00B783 and 0\u00B755 vs 0\u00B780) tests.

In contrast to humans, MERS-CoV\u2013exposed dromedaries develop only very mild infections and exceptionally potent virus-neutralizing antibody responses. These strong antibody responses may be caused by affinity maturation as a result of repeated exposure to the virus or by the fact that dromedaries\u2014apart from conventional antibodies\u2014have relatively unique, heavy chain\u2013only antibodies (HCAbs). These HCAbs are devoid of light chains and have long complementarity-determining regions with unique epitope binding properties, allowing them to recognize and bind with high affinity to epitopes not recognized by conventional antibodies. Through direct cloning and expression of the variable heavy chains (VHHs) of HCAbs from the bone marrow of MERS-CoV\u2013infected dromedaries, we identified several MERS-CoV\u2013specific VHHs or nanobodies. In vitro, these VHHs efficiently blocked virus entry at picomolar concentrations. The selected VHHs bind with exceptionally high affinity to the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein.

Knockout mice defective in IFN signaling quickly succumb to all kinds of viral infections. Likewise, humans with genetic defects in interferon signaling die of viral disease at an early age. Among the known interferon-induced antiviral mechanisms, the Mx pathway is one of the most powerful. Mx proteins belong to the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases and have direct antiviral activity. They inhibit a wide range of viruses by blocking an early stage of the viral replication cycle. Likewise, the protein kinase R (PKR), and the 2\u20135 OAS/RNaseL system represent major antiviral pathways and have been extensively studied. Viruses, in turn, have evolved multiple strategies to escape the IFN system. They try to go undetected, suppress IFN synthesis, bind and neutralize secreted IFN molecules, block IFN signaling, or inhibit the action of IFN-induced antiviral proteins. Here, we summarize recent findings about the astonishing interplay of viruses with the IFN response pathway.","publish_time":"2007-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haller, Otto; Kochs, Georg; Weber, Friedemann","journal":"Cytokine Growth Factor Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3de86b0356f38fb81a118d23c16f51dafc458e63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185553.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S135961010700069X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135961010700069X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN system","IFN synthesis","block IFN","action of IFN","IFN response pathway","secreted IFN molecules","interferon system","antiviral proteins","antiviral mechanisms","direct antiviral activity","astonishing interplay of viruses","major antiviral pathways","RNaseL system","known interferon","wide range of viruses","Mx pathway","Mx proteins","die of viral disease","viral replication cycle","kinds of viral infections","early stage","early age","dynamin superfamily of large GTPases","universal intracellular defense mechanism","genetic defects","OAS","multiple strategies","recent findings","PKR","protein kinase R","humans","turn","Knockout mice defective"],"language":"en"},

We have performed a prospective study in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the incidence of respiratory infections, their impact and the epidemiology and outcome in high risk neonates. Patients and methods From September 2011 to May 2013 a prospective study was conducted in all preterm infants \u003C32 weeks gestational age and in all term newborns admitted to NICU for any pathology that was anticipated to have an admission exceeding two weeks. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected the first day of life and weekly until discharge for virologic study with polymerase chain reaction. When these babies presented respiratory symptoms a new NPA was collected at this moment. A clinical form was filled by the physician. Results A total of 60 infants were analysed: 30 (50%) had a gestational age \u003C32 weeks and 36 (60%) weighed less than 1500g. We collected a total of 256 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, 24 of them being positive (9.3%). These 24 positive samples corresponded to 13 infants in our cohort (21.6% of the patients). Of them, 9 were symptomatic and had 11 episodes of infection (2 patients had two different episodes with negative control between them). The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus in (19) 79% of cases. The most frequent clinical data was the presence or increase in apneas (75%) and the need for oxygenotherapy. Conclusions HRV infections are prevalent in the NICU, and preterm infants have a high risk of infections with clinical relevance.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonzalez-Carrasco, E.; Calvo, C.; Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, M.

The PDCoV nsp5 cleavage site in the NEMO protein was identified as glutamine 231, and was identical to the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus nsp5 cleavage site, revealing the likelihood of a common target in NEMO for coronaviruses. Furthermore, this cleavage impaired the ability of NEMO to activate the IFN response and downstream signaling.

The aim of this research was to assess the potential of utilising Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) assessments in providing a framework for a rapid response to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This novel approach applies a scientific process, widely used in food production systems, to assess risks related to a specific emerging health threat within a known zoonotic disease hotspot. We conducted a HACCP assessment for HPAI viruses within Vietnam\u2019s domestic poultry trade and relate our findings to the existing literature. Our HACCP assessment identified poultry flock isolation, transportation, slaughter, preparation and consumption as critical control points for Vietnam\u2019s domestic poultry trade. Introduction of the preventative measures highlighted through this HACCP evaluation would reduce the risks posed by HPAI viruses and pressure on the national economy. We conclude that this HACCP assessment provides compelling evidence for the future potential that HACCP analyses could play in initiating a rapid response to emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2013-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edmunds, Kelly L.; Hunter, Paul R.; Few, Roger; Bell, Diana J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ae4cc1c1b639a21e95972d63cfe5822b96d136d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3743774.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23967294/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points","HACCP"],"locations":["Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["HACCP assessment","HACCP evaluation","HACCP analyses","HPAI viruses","HPAI H5N1","poultry outbreaks","Vietnam\u2019s domestic poultry trade","infectious disease outbreaks","control programmes","poultry flock isolation","risks","rapid response","expensive zoonotic disease","specific emerging health threat","potential of utilising Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points","known zoonotic disease hotspot","global health threat","direct mortality","future potential","strain H5N1","infectious diseases","slaughter","transportation","preparation","consumption","indirect economic impacts","compelling evidence","pathogenic avian influenza virus","findings","pressure","assessments","scientific process","food production systems","preventative measures","framework","countries","national economy","novel approach","existing literature","Introduction","research","aim"],"language":"en"},

Enhancing global capacity to study and interpret infectious disease surveillance data, and to develop data-driven computational models to guide policy, represents one of the most cost-effective, and yet overlooked, ways to prepare for the next pandemic. Epidemiological and behavioral data from recent pandemics and historic scourges have provided rich opportunities for validation of computational models, while new sequencing technologies and the \u2018big data\u2019 revolution present new tools for studying the epidemiology of outbreaks in real time. For the past two decades, the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies (DIEPS) of the NIH Fogarty International Center has spearheaded two synergistic programs to better understand and devise control strategies for global infectious disease threats. The Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study (MISMS) has strengthened global capacity to study the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses in 80 countries by organizing international research activities and training workshops. The Research and Policy in Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program and its precursor activities has established a network of global experts in infectious disease modeling operating at the research-policy interface, with collaborators in 78 countries. These activities have provided evidence-based recommendations for disease control, including during large-scale outbreaks of pandemic influenza, Ebola and Zika virus. Together, these programs have coordinated international collaborative networks to advance the study of emerging disease threats and the field of computational epidemic modeling. A global community of researchers and policy-makers have used the tools and trainings developed by these programs to interpret infectious disease patterns in their countries, understand modeling concepts, and inform control policies. Here we reflect on the scientific achievements and lessons learnt from these programs (h-index = 106 for RAPIDD and 79 for MISMS), including the identification of outstanding researchers and fellows; funding flexibility for timely research workshops and working groups (particularly relative to more traditional investigator-based grant programs); emphasis on group activities such as large-scale modeling reviews, model comparisons, forecasting challenges and special journal issues; strong quality control with a light touch on outputs; and prominence of training, data-sharing, and joint publications.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelson, Martha I.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.; Simonsen, Lone; Rambaut, Andrew; Holmes, Edward C.; Chowell, Gerardo; Miller, Mark A.; Spiro, David J.; Grenfell, Bryan; Viboud, C\u00E9cile","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c0e2ac9d7085f613692fbce4f20972f718fc8b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105018.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S175543651830029X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2018.10.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30446431/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175543651830029X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIH Fogarty International Center"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease control","infectious disease modeling","global infectious disease threats","Infectious Disease Dynamics","infectious disease surveillance data","infectious disease patterns","international research activities","study of emerging disease threats","global capacity","big data","data-sharing","behavioral data","synergistic programs","research-policy interface","countries","Division of International Epidemiology","global community of researchers","epidemiology of outbreaks","control policies","group activities","modeling concepts","precursor activities","policy-makers","large-scale modeling reviews","timely research workshops","network of global experts","large-scale outbreaks of pandemic influenza","field of computational epidemic modeling","strong quality control","devise control strategies","traditional investigator-based grant programs","validation of computational models","international collaborative networks","RAPIDD","Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study","MISMS","training workshops","recent decades","evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses","NIH Fogarty International Center","revolution present new tools","recent pandemics","prominence of training","new sequencing technologies","evidence-based recommendations","identification of outstanding researchers","challenges","special journal issues","fellows","historic scourges","funding flexibility","DIEPS","rich opportunities","model comparisons","light touch","Ebola","emphasis","demographic factors","Population Studies","outputs","groups","combination of ecological","emergence of novel pathogens","animals","lessons","Zika virus","collaborators","h-index","humans","joint publications","real time","trainings","scientific achievements","ways"],"language":"en"},

There seems to be no limit to the ability to raise antibodies to everything. (ii) once stimulated, B-cells can perfect their antibodies through affinity maturation to complement every nook and cranny of the epitope and (iii) that the pathogen remains genetically stable and does not change to any great extent. Thus, antibodies produced against the vaccine and subsequent boosts recognize the viral virulent field isolates in future encounters and effectively knock them out. However, some vaccine targets, such as flu virus and HIV, are extremely genetically dynamic. The rapid genetic drift of these viruses renders them moving targets which assist in their ability to evade immune surveillance. Here we postulate that in the case of hyper-variable pathogens the B-cell response actually might be \u201Ctoo good\u201D. We propose that restricting B-cell activities may prove effective in counteracting the genetic diversity of variant viruses such as flu and HIV. We suggest two levels of \u201CB-cell restriction\u201D: (i) to focus the B-cell response exclusively towards neutralizing epitopes by creating epitope-based immunogens; (ii) to restrict affinity maturation of B-cells to prevent the production of overly optimized exquisitely specific antibodies.

Ecological niche modeling has seen increasing applications as a useful tool in mapping geographic potential and risk of disease transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPALS: We developed two datasets based on seasonal variation in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the MODIS sensor to characterize environmental dimensions of H7N9 virus. One-third of well-documented cases was used to test robustness of models calibrated based on the remaining two-thirds, and model significance was tested using partial ROC approaches. A final niche model was calibrated using all records available. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Central-eastern China appears to represent an area of high risk for H7N9 spread, but suitable areas were distributed more spottily in the north and only along the coast in the south; highly suitable areas also were identified in western Taiwan. Areas identified as presenting high risk for H7N9 spread tend to present consistent NDVI values through the year, whereas unsuitable areas show greater seasonal variation.","publish_time":"2014-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Gengping; Peterson, A.

These putative replication complexes are composed of intimately associated but biochemically distinct membrane populations, each of which contains proteins processed from the replicase (gene 1) polyprotein. Specifically, one membrane population contains the gene 1 proteins p65 and p1a-22, while the other contains the gene 1 proteins p28 and helicase, as well as the structural nucleocapsid (N) protein and newly synthesized viral RNA. In this study, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to define the relationship of the membrane populations comprising the putative replication complexes at different times of infection in MHV-A59-infected delayed brain tumor cells. At 5.5 h postinfection (p.i.) the membranes containing N and helicase colocalized with the membranes containing p1a-22/p65 at foci distinct from sites of M accumulation. By 8 to 12 h p.i., however, the membranes containing helicase and N had a predominantly perinuclear distribution and colocalized with M. In contrast, the p1a-22/p65-containing membranes retained a peripheral, punctate distribution at all times of infection and did not colocalize with M. By late times of infection, helicase, N, and M each also colocalized with ERGIC p53, a specific marker for the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi\u2013intermediate compartment. These data demonstrated that the putative replication complexes separated into component membranes that relocalized during the course of infection. These results suggest that the membrane populations within the MHV replication complex serve distinct functions both in RNA synthesis and in delivery of replication products to sites of virus assembly.","publish_time":"2001-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bost, Anne G.; Prentice, Erik; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/460a0c00672c697213976074813c9060fa3d4ba0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682201909328; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682201909328","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["putative replication complexes","helicase","distinct membrane populations","MHV replication complex","component membranes","proteins p65","gene","p1a","different times of infection","late times of infection","RNA synthesis","course of infection","delivery of replication products","synthesis of viral RNA","MHV-A59","discrete membranous complexes","synthesized viral RNA","distinct functions","foci distinct","proteins p28","sites of virus assembly","punctate distribution","perinuclear distribution","h postinfection","coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","endoplasmic reticulum","infected delayed brain tumor cells","specific marker","Golgi","intermediate compartment","structural nucleocapsid","immunofluorescence confocal microscopy","study","ERGIC p53","accumulation","replicase","relationship","data","polyprotein","contrast","results","cell cytoplasm"],"language":"en"},

Serious games provide an underutilized tool to promote learning and innovation around global health crises. In order to explore the potential of Serious Games as a policy learning tool, Global Affairs Canada, in collaboration with the Department of National Defense and academic partners, developed and implemented a matrix game aimed at prompting critical reflection and gender-based analysis on infectious disease outbreak preparedness and response. This commentary, written by the core development team, reflects on the process and outcomes of the gaming exercise, which we believe will be of interest to others hoping to promote innovative thinking and learning around global health policy and crisis response, as well as the application of serious games more broadly. MAIN BODY: Participants reported, through discussions and a post-game survey, that they felt the game was reflective of real-world decision-making and priority-setting challenges during a crisis. They reflected on the challenges that emerge around global health co-operation and outbreak preparedness, particularly noting the importance of learning to work with private actors. While participants only sporadically applied gender-based analysis or considered the social determinants of health during the game, post-game discussions led to reflection on the ways in which equity concerns are put aside during a crisis scenario and on why this happens, offering critical learning opportunities. CONCLUSION: Matrix games provide opportunities for policy-makers and health professionals to experience the challenges of global health co-operation, test ideas and explore how biases, such as those around gender, influence policy-making and implementation. Due to their flexibility, adaptability and accessibility, serious games offer a potentially powerful learning tool for global health policy-makers and practitioners.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Julia; Sears, Nathan; Taylor, Ben; Johnson, Madeline","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7063729.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32151263/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00547-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Affairs Canada","Department of National Defense"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global health policy-makers","global health crises","global health organizations","challenges of global health co-operation","policy learning tool","health professionals","widespread recognition of global health failures","social determinants of health","influence policy","importance of learning","Matrix games","powerful learning tool","Global Affairs Canada","critical learning opportunities","potential of Serious Games","application of serious games","post-game discussions","post-game survey","crisis response","underutilized tool","infectious disease outbreak preparedness","applied gender-based analysis","critical reflection","Participants","crisis scenario","infectious disease outbreaks","collaboration","innovation","Department of National Defense","little discussion","test ideas","process","priority","reflective of real-world decision-making","academic partners","innovative thinking","ways","adaptability","accessibility","practitioners","core development team","outcomes","gaming exercise","equity concerns","biases","flexibility","CONCLUSION","MAIN BODY","private actors","commentary","BACKGROUND","order","implementation"],"language":"en"},

IBV shows rapid evolution in chickens, frequently producing new antigenic types, which adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect. Rapid evolution in IBV is facilitated by strong selection, large population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts, and transmission bottlenecks between hosts. Genetic diversity within a host arises primarily by mutation, which includes substitutions, insertions and deletions. Mutations are caused both by the high error rate, and limited proof reading capability, of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, and by recombination. Recombination also generates new haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants.

The distally located VP8* domain of the rotavirus spike protein VP4(5) mediates such interactions. The existing paradigm is that \u2018sialidase-sensitive\u2019 animal rotavirus strains bind to glycans with terminal sialic acid (Sia), whereas \u2018sialidase-insensitive\u2019 human rotavirus (HR) strains bind to glycans with internal Sia such as GM1(3). Although the involvement of Sia in the animal strains is firmly supported by crystallographic studies(1,3,6,7), it is not yet known how VP8* of HRs interacts with Sia and whether their cell attachment necessarily involves sialoglycans. We found that VP8* of a HR strain specifically recognizes A-type histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) using a glycan array screen comprised of 511 glycans, and that virus infectivity in HT-29 cells is abrogated by anti-Atype antibodies as well as significantly enhanced in CHO cells genetically modified to express the A-type HBGA, providing a novel paradigm for initial cell attachment of HR. HBGAs are genetically determined glycoconjugates present in mucosal secretions, epithelial and on red blood cells(8), and are recognized as susceptibility and cell attachment factors for gastric pathogens like H. pylori(9) and noroviruses(10). Our crystallographic studies show that the A-type HBGA binds to the HR VP8* at the same location as the Sia in the VP8* of animal rotavirus, and suggest how subtle changes within the same structural framework allow for such receptor switching. These results raise the possibility that host susceptibility to specific HR strains and pathogenesis are influenced by genetically controlled expression of different HBGAs among the world\u2019s population.","publish_time":"2012-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Liya; Crawford, Sue E.; Czako, Rita; Cortes-Penfield, Nicolas W; Smith, David F.; Le Pendu, Jacques; Estes, Mary K.; Venkataram Prasad, B.

In lieu of preparing vaccine in animal skin (the original method), we cloned vaccinia virus (New York City Board of Health strain, Dryvax\u00AE) by plaque purification and amplified the clone in cell culture. The overarching goal was to produce a modern vaccine that was equivalent to the currently licensed Dryvax\u00AE in its preclinical and clinical properties, and could thus reliably protect humans against smallpox. A variety of clones were evaluated, and many were unacceptably virulent in animal models. One clonal virus (ACAM1000) was selected and produced at clinical grade in MRC-5 human diploid cells. ACAM1000 was comparable to Dryvax\u00AE in immunogenicity and protective activity but was less neurovirulent for mice and nonhuman primates. To meet requirements for large quantities of vaccine after the events of September 11th 2001, the ACAM1000 master virus seed was used to prepare vaccine (designated ACAM2000) at large scale in Vero cells under serum-free conditions. The genomes of ACAM1000 and ACAM2000 had identical nucleotide sequences, and the vaccines had comparable biological phenotypes. ACAM1000 and ACAM2000 were evaluated in three Phase 1 clinical trials. The vaccines produced major cutaneous reactions and evoked neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses in the vast majority of subjects and had a reactogenicity profile similar to that of Dryvax\u00AE.","publish_time":"2004-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monath, Thomas P.; Caldwell, Joseph R.; Mundt, Wolfgang; Fusco, Joan; Johnson, Casey S.; Buller, Mark; Liu, Jian; Gardner, Bridget; Downing, Greg; Blum, Paul S.; Kemp, Tracy; Nichols, Richard; Weltzin, Richard","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9e4babb9ee829a0dbb6118a4b47b0669b2c01b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110559.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971204001341; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971204001341","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["New York City Board of Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stockpiles of vaccine","modern vaccine","genomes of ACAM1000","licensed Dryvax","ACAM1000 master virus seed","large quantities of vaccine","vaccines","vaccinia virus","designated ACAM2000","clonal virus","clinical grade","clinical trials","clinical properties","comparable biological phenotypes","Vero cells","biological weapon","cell culture","animal skin","threat of smallpox","animal models","human diploid cells","evoked neutralizing antibody","New York City Board of Health strain","major cutaneous reactions","immune responses","scale","identical nucleotide sequences","neurovirulent","vast majority of subjects","MRC","original method","protective activity","serum-free conditions","reactogenicity profile similar","mice","plaque purification","immunogenicity","efforts","nonhuman primates","requirements","events","emergency preparedness","Phase","overarching goal","Summary","variety of clones","humans"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to utilise laboratory data from the winter season following the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) outbreak to investigate rates of respiratory virus co-infections, virus prevalence in different age groups and temporal variations in virus detection. The Health Protection Agency Public Health Laboratory (HPA PHL) Birmingham, UK, routinely uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect common respiratory viruses. The results from specimens received for respiratory virus investigations from late September 2009 to April 2010 were analysed. A total of 4,821 specimen results were analysed. Of these, 323 (13.2 %) had co-detections of two viruses, 22 (0.9 %) had three viruses and four (0.2 %) had four viruses. Reciprocal patterns of positive or negative associations between different virus pairs were found. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of negative associations between influenza A and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and influenza A and rhinovirus. Positive associations between parainfluenza with rhinovirus, rhinovirus with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus with rhinovirus, parainfluenza and RSV were also significant. Age and temporal distributions of the different viruses were typical. This study found that the co-detection of different respiratory viruses is not random and most associations are reciprocal, either positively or negatively. The pandemic strain of influenza A(H1N1) was notable in that it was the least likely to be co-detected with another respiratory virus.","publish_time":"2012-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tanner, H.; Boxall, E.; Osman, H.","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0524fafe0b03fb87d807fc7f1bad10b55e369ec4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088042.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-012-1653-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22678349/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Protection Agency Public Health Laboratory","HPA PHL","UK","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different viruses","common respiratory viruses","co-detection of different respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory virus investigations","rates of respiratory virus co-infections","virus detection","different virus pairs","virus prevalence","rhinovirus","Acute viral respiratory infections","Positive associations","co-detections","different age groups","common infections","significance of negative associations","RSV","parainfluenza","pandemic strain of influenza","H1N1","study","Reciprocal patterns of positive","Health Protection Agency Public Health Laboratory","temporal variations","laboratory data","temporal distributions","specimen results","HPA PHL","UK","Birmingham","PCR","adenovirus","human metapneumovirus","polymerase chain reaction","outbreak","winter season","HMPV","specimens","Statistical analysis","total","humans","aim"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments about virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature. SOURCES: We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects. CONTENT: We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options. IMPLICATIONS: The key challenge in managing COVID-19 remains the patient density. However, accurate diagnoses as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases are important for many clinicians. For improved management of cases, there is a need to understand test probability of serology, qRT-PCR and radiological testing, and the efficacy of available treatment options that could be used in severe cases with a high risk of mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cevik, Muge; Bamford, Connor; Ho, Antonia","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa39ec2d3d5a1170b7f04ae53da6c042602ff41e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182753.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20302317?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.04.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20302317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical management aspects","clinical course of COVID","clinicians","current treatment options","clinical presentation","clinical practice","improved management of cases","management of high-risk severe cases","emphasis","efficacy of available treatment options","SARS-CoV","duration of viral shedding","published peer-reviewed papers","related aspects","current literature","wealth of data","non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts","virological characteristics of SARS","diagnostics","COVID19","severity markers","early identification","virology","qRT-PCR","recent developments","global health","economics","test probability of serology","radiological testing","significant issue","evolving guidelines","diagnostic challenges","time of uncertainty","update","need","pandemic","high risk of mortality","society","accurate diagnoses","world","key challenge","IMPLICATIONS","CONTENT","SOURCES","patient density","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES","emergence"],"language":"en"},

These pathogens initially infect the upper respiratory tract and then reach the lower respiratory tract, leading to diseases. Vaccination is an affordable way to control the pathogenicity of viruses and constitutes the strategy of choice to fight against infections, including those leading to pulmonary diseases. Conventional vaccines based on live-attenuated pathogens present a risk of reversion to pathogenic virulence while inactivated pathogen vaccines often lead to a weak immune response. Subunit vaccines were developed to overcome these issues. However, these vaccines may suffer from a limited immunogenicity and, in most cases, the protection induced is only partial. A new generation of vaccines based on nanoparticles has shown great potential to address most of the limitations of conventional and subunit vaccines. This is due to recent advances in chemical and biological engineering, which allow the design of nanoparticles with a precise control over the size, shape, functionality and surface properties, leading to enhanced antigen presentation and strong immunogenicity. This short review provides an overview of the advantages associated with the use of nanoparticles as vaccine delivery platforms to immunize against respiratory viruses and highlights relevant examples demonstrating their potential as safe, effective and affordable vaccines.","publish_time":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Halifa, Soultan; Gauthier, Laurie; Arpin, Dominic; Bourgault, Steve; Archambault, Denis","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/390b4e40d86e389acf5cb47705c7c02eca264c8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6353795.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733717/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["affordable vaccines","Conventional vaccines","Subunit vaccines","respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory mucosa","inactivated pathogen vaccines","new generation of vaccines","lower respiratory tract","upper respiratory tract","numerous viruses","pathogenicity of viruses","use of nanoparticles","design of nanoparticles","parainfluenza virus","strong immunogenicity","affordable way","great potential","precise control","limited immunogenicity","limitations of conventional","pulmonary diseases","live-attenuated pathogens","risk of reversion","surface properties","shape","pathogenic virulence","enhanced antigen presentation","primary portal of entry","vaccine delivery platforms","biological engineering","size","relevant examples","recent advances","functionality","cases","advantages","strategy of choice","protection induced","overview","infections","weak immune response","short review","Vaccination","issues"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, impaired metabolism of glycoprotein components plays the main role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of glycoprotein levels in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. METHODS: All relevant papers in the English language were compiled by searching electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane library. The keywords of glycoprotein, diabetes mellitus, glycan, glycosylation, and inhibitor were searched until January 2019. RESULTS: Glycoproteins are pivotal elements in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, maturation and signaling pathways. Moreover, they are involved in drug binding, drug transportation, efflux of chemicals and stability of therapeutic proteins. These functions, structure, composition, linkages, biosynthesis, significance and biological effects are discussed as related to their use as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications. CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed several chemical and natural compounds have significant beneficial effects on glycoprotein metabolism. The comprehension of glycoprotein structure and functions are very essential and inevitable to enhance the knowledge of glycoengineering for glycoprotein-based therapeutics as may be required for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its associated complications.

We assessed temporal changes and geographical differences in risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors in response to H1N1 influenza. METHODS: 1,290 US adults completed an online survey on risk perceptions, interests in pharmaceutical interventions (preventive intervention and curative intervention), and engagement in precautionary activities (information seeking activities and taking quarantine measures) in response to H1N1 influenza between April 28 and May 27 2009. Associations of risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors with respondents\u0027 sex, age, and household size were analyzed. Linear and quadratic time trends were assessed by regression analyses. Geographic differences in risk perception and precautionary behaviors were evaluated. Predictors of willingness to take pharmaceutical intervention were analyzed. RESULTS: Respondents from larger households reported stronger interest in taking medications and engaged in more precautionary activities, as would be normatively predicted. Perceived risk increased over time, whereas interest in pharmaceutical preventive interventions and the engagement in some precautionary activities decreased over time. Respondents who live in states with higher H1N1 incidence per population perceived a higher likelihood of influenza infection, but did not express greater interests in pharmaceutical interventions, nor did they engage in a higher degree of precautionary activities. Perceived likelihood of influenza infection, willingness to take medications and engagement in information seeking activities were higher for women than men. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived risk of infection and precautionary behavior can be dynamic in time, and differ by demographic characteristics and geographical locations. These patterns will likely influence the effectiveness of disease control measures.","publish_time":"2010-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ibuka, Yoko; Chapman, Gretchen B; Meyers, Lauren A; Li, Meng; Galvani, Alison P","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68a4cb26f4d7448117bfcb2d2794211c04605765.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8a584984728d9dd104a0d3928686d4a2e02e2ebf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2964717.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20946662/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Linear"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["precautionary behaviors","higher degree of precautionary activities","Perceived risk of infection","Associations of risk perceptions","pharmaceutical interventions","H1N1 influenza","individuals\u0027 risk perception","higher likelihood of influenza infection","Perceived likelihood of influenza infection","engagement","pharmaceutical preventive interventions","higher H1N1 incidence","information","geographical differences","curative intervention","medications","response","quadratic time trends","behavior of individuals","Geographic differences","quarantine measures","geographical locations","Predictors of willingness","effectiveness of disease control measures","express greater interests","infectious disease outbreak","respondents\u0027 sex","population","online survey","states","US adults","larger households","temporal changes","trajectory","demographic characteristics","women","household size","regression analyses","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","patterns"],"language":"en"},

To avoid excessive and harmful immune effects caused by over-activation of these signaling pathways, host cells adopt a number of strategies to regulate them.

Conventional field-effect-transistor (FET)-based techniques use solution-based processes, thus require antibody binding to the detection region of the FET prior to the supply of the analyte. With the method described here, virus\u2013antibody-bound particles are delivered to the FET during detection; therefore, neither a pre-treatment antibody binding step on the FET channel nor washing process for virus\u2013antibody-binding are necessary. Our method is based on the concept that virus\u2013antibody-bound particles are larger than the virus or antibody alone, and thus have larger charge numbers following aerosol charging. When these particles are charged by negative ions and electro-aerodynamically deposited on a substrate, there exists a location on the substrate where neither lone virus nor antibody particles land, and where only virus\u2013antibody-bound particles are deposited. If this location coincides with the channel of the FET, the resulting variation in the current can be used to indicate the existence of a virus. By aerosolizing a mixed solution of the virus and the antibody, only the virus\u2013antibody-bound particles were transported to the swCNT-FET, and the electric current in the swCNT-FET decreased to 30% of that measured with no deposited particles.","publish_time":"2015-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Kyu-Tae; Cho, Dong-Guk; Park, Ji-Woon; Hong, Seunghun; Hwang, Jungho","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcceda0265e3540a12eef54836297a20d890c4a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4672335.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26642822/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep17462","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibody-bound particles","antibody-binding","antibody particles land","lone virus","deposited particles","FET channel","swCNT-FET","pre-treatment antibody binding step","based techniques","solution-based processes","detection region","substrate","location","method","detection of aerosolized viruses","electric current","mixed solution","larger charge numbers","transistor","aerosol charging","concept","Conventional field-effect","resulting variation","negative ions","supply","analyte","existence"],"language":"en"},

There is a dearth of data investigating adoption of preventive behaviors in the initial phase of the A/H1N1 pandemic. Methods Three round of random, population-based, anonymous telephone survey were conducted in Hong Kong during the pre-community outbreak phase (May 7 to June 6, 2009) of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong (n = 999). Results Respectively, 46.65%, 88.75%, and 21.5% washed hands more than 10 times/day, wore face masks when having influenza-like illness (ILI), and wore face masks regularly in public areas. Perceptions related to bodily damages, efficacy of frequent handwashing, nonavailability of effective vaccines, high chance of having a large scale local outbreak, and mental distress because of influenza A/H1N1 were associated with frequent handwashing (odds ratio [OR], 1.46 to 2.15). Perceived vaccine availability was associated with face mask use when having ILI (OR, 1.60). Perceived fatality, efficacy of wearing face masks, and mental distress because of influenza A/H1N1 were associated with face mask use in public areas (OR, 1.53 to 2.52). Conclusion Preventive behaviors were prevalently adopted by the public and were associated with cognitive and affective factors. Prevention efforts should take public perceptions into account, and emerging infectious diseases provide good chances for promoting hygiene.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Joseph T.F.; Griffiths, Sian; Choi, Kai-chow; Lin, Chunqing","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0330f3c9bbb2cc1f7bba2fc1d869c329c47fdf5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132693.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655310001860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20569849/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655310001860; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2010.03.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["influenza","face masks","H1N1 pandemic","face mask use","public perceptions","public areas","Hong Kong","mental distress","efficacy of frequent handwashing","pre-community outbreak phase","adoption of preventive behaviors","Conclusion Preventive behaviors","initial phase","Perceived fatality","Perceived vaccine availability","large scale local outbreak","high chance","emerging infectious diseases","nonavailability of effective vaccines","population","account","good chances","anonymous telephone survey","times","bodily damages","day","round of random","dearth of data","Prevention efforts","important role","Methods","hygiene","odds ratio","illness","washed hands","affective factors","Results"],"language":"en"},

Identification of aggregates has become a useful diagnostic tool for certain viral infections. There is wide variety of viral aggregates, which differ by their location, size, content and putative function. The role of aggregation in the context of a specific virus is often poorly understood, especially in the case of plant viruses. The aggregates are utilized by viruses to house a large complex of proteins of both viral and host origin to promote virus replication, translation, intra- and intercellular transportation. Aggregated structures may protect viral functional complexes from the cellular degradation machinery. Alternatively, the activation of host defense mechanisms may involve sequestration of virus components in aggregates, followed by their neutralization as toxic for the host cell. The diversity of virus-induced aggregates in mammalian and plant cells is the subject of this review.","publish_time":"2012-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moshe, Adi; Gorovits, Rena","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a42a9560d5371f3ef833955321604002b8b35914.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3497049.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202461/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v4102218","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced aggregates","Identification of aggregates","wide variety of viral aggregates","viral structural proteins","formation of insoluble aggregates","virus replication","specific virus","diversity of virus","viral functional complexes","certain viral infections","sequestration of virus components","host origin","host cell","case of plant viruses","activation of host defense mechanisms","cellular remodeling","plant cells","cellular degradation machinery","large complex of proteins","useful diagnostic tool","translation","mammalian","inclusions","size","content","subject","context","location","Aggregated structures","neutralization","putative function","intercellular transportation","toxic","role of aggregation","review"],"language":"en"},

Out of the 27 H9 virus isolates, the hemagglutinins of 18 strains were genetically classified as belonging to the sublineage G1, and the other nine belonged to the Korean sublineage. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that one of the 27 H9 viruses was a reassortant in which the PB2 gene belonged to the Korean sublineage and the other seven genes belonged to the G1 sublineage. Three representative H9N2 viruses were intranasally inoculated into ducks, chickens, pigs, and mice. On the basis of experimental infection studies, it was found that each of the three viruses readily infected pigs and replicated in their upper respiratory tracts, and they infected chickens with slight replication. Viruses were recovered from the lungs of mice inoculated with two of the three isolates. The present results reveal that H9 avian influenza viruses are prevailing and genetic reassortment occurs among domestic ducks in Vietnam.

Four groups of 30 molecules each were considered: oxadiazolone, oxadiazolthione, thiadiazolone, and thiadiazolthione isomers. The compounds were categorized into six groups according to permutations of three heteroatoms in the five-membered ring. Additionally, each of the constitutional isomer was considered to have five tautomers conserving stable five-membered ring: two NH tautomers, two rotameric OH (or SH) forms and one CH2 tautomer. It appeared that the largest difference between oxadiazolone O and S analogues is produced by the kind of chalcogen atom in the ring, which is strained when the O atom is in the ring while much less strained when the S-atom, of much larger van der Waals radius, is built into the ring. The external chalcogen is only modifying the general energetic factors. The comparison of energetics of analogous groups of molecules with thiadiazole and oxadiazole rings is done in details as well as differences resulting from different external chalcogen atoms are discussed as well. The presence of water surrounding was mimicked with the IEF-PCM implicit water model which did not change general isomer relative stability picture, but for some special cases indicated an extra stability of the forms with external OH or SH groups. The aromaticity monitored by the structural HOMA aromaticity index shows that the systems are not additionally stabilized by pi-electron delocalization. The fair linear correlation between the aromaticity indices of oxadiazolones and oxadiazolthiones shows that the pi-electron system in the studied systems is not sensitive to change of the external chalcogen group.","publish_time":"2013-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karpi\u0144ska, Gra\u017Cyna; Dobrowolski, Jan Cz.","journal":"Computational and Theoretical Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/811ae9afd7a07d05da065433fcccafda4ca8ca33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104208.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210271X12005567; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210271X12005567; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comptc.2012.11.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HOMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["membered ring","external OH","SH groups","external chalcogen group","kind of chalcogen atom","tautomers of oxadiazolones","different external chalcogen atoms","S-atom","O atom","analogous groups of molecules","forms","aromaticity indices of oxadiazolones","S analogues","NH tautomers","oxadiazolone O","constitutional isomers","pi-electron system","pi-electron delocalization","general isomer relative stability picture","extra stability","rotameric OH","structural HOMA aromaticity index","studied systems","disulfur analogues","thiadiazolthione isomers","general energetic factors","presence of water surrounding","IEF-PCM implicit water model","thiadiazole","differences","oxadiazolthiones","special cases","oxadiazole rings","larger van","largest difference","fair linear correlation","thiadiazolone","heteroatoms","Waals radius","comparison of energetics","details","B3LYP","mono","CH2 tautomer","cc-pVDZ level","permutations","compounds"],"language":"en"},

A Phase 2b/3 clinical trial recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that oral administration of nitazoxanide 600mg twice daily for five days reduced the duration of clinical symptoms and reduced viral shedding compared to placebo in persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza. The same study also suggested a potential benefit for subjects with influenza-like illness who did not have influenza or other documented respiratory viral infection. From a chemical perspective, nitazoxanide is the scaffold for a new class of drugs called thiazolides. These small-molecule drugs target host-regulated processes involved in viral replication. Nitazoxanide is orally bioavailable and safe with extensive post-marketing experience involving more than 75 million adults and children. A new dosage formulation of nitazoxanide is presently undergoing global Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of influenza. Nitazoxanide inhibits a broad range of influenza A and B viruses including influenza A(pH1N1) and the avian A(H7N9) as well as viruses that are resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors. It is synergistic with neuraminidase inhibitors, and combination therapy with oseltamivir is being studied in humans as part of ongoing Phase 3 clinical development. Nitazoxanide also inhibits the replication of a broad range of other RNA and DNA viruses including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, coronavirus, rotavirus, norovirus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus in cell culture assays. Clinical trials have indicated a potential role for thiazolides in treating rotavirus and norovirus gastroenteritis and chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C. Ongoing and future clinical development is focused on viral respiratory infections, viral gastroenteritis and emerging infections such as dengue fever.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rossignol, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe05264e89324c67b481801e81b80545c7c2f291.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113776.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108173/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214002137; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214002137; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.07.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of influenza","broad range of influenza","viral gastroenteritis","B viruses","viral replication","Clinical trials","chronic hepatitis B","viral respiratory infections","future clinical development","viral shedding","oral administration of nitazoxanide","new dosage formulation of nitazoxanide","duration of clinical symptoms","hepatitis C","documented respiratory viral infection","ongoing Phase","respiratory syncytial virus","norovirus gastroenteritis","rotavirus","dengue fever","DNA viruses","new class of drugs","global Phase","thiazolides","neuraminidase inhibitors","human immunodeficiency virus","Japanese encephalitis virus","emerging infections","yellow fever","potential role","potential benefit","class broad-spectrum antiviral drug","small-molecule drugs target host-regulated processes","parainfluenza","coronavirus","RNA","scaffold","Lancet Infectious Diseases","cell culture assays","extensive post-marketing experience","persons","combination therapy","oseltamivir","placebo","subjects","pH1N1","days","chemical perspective","laboratory","humans","illness","adults","study","H7N9","antiprotozoal agent","children"],"language":"en"},

In order to better understand the role of camels in virus transmission we experimentally infected 3 adult, male dromedary camels with a human isolate of MERS CoV. All animals developed a transient, upper respiratory tract infection associated with very minor clinical disease. Large quantities of infectious virus were isolated from nasal secretions from each animal through 7 days post-inoculation, and viral RNA was detected much longer. Although our study design was limited to 3 animals, these data indicate that MERS CoV readily infects camels, which shed large amounts of virus and likely can efficiently transmit virus to other camels and humans.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adney, DR; Brown, VR; van Doremalen, N; Bushmaker, T; Scott, D; de Wit, E; Munster, VA; Bowen, RA","journal":"New Horizons in Translational Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2307502315000843; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2307502315000843","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["role of camels","virus transmission","male dromedary camels","large amounts of virus","Large quantities of infectious virus","human isolate of MERS CoV","severe respiratory disease","animals","humans","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","upper respiratory tract infection","novel coronavirus","minor clinical disease","days post-inoculation","nasal secretions","viral RNA","endemic areas","data","study design","reservoir host","antibodies","order"],"language":"en"},

The sequencing of these six CC strains updates the efforts toward inbreeding undertaken by the UNC Systems Genetics Core. The timing reflects our competing mandates to release to the public as many CC strains as possible while achieving an acceptable level of inbreeding. The new six strains have a higher than average founder contribution from non-domesticus strains than the previously released CC strains. Five of the six strains also have high residual heterozygosity (\u003E14%), which may be related to non-domesticus founder contributions. Finally, we report on updated estimates on residual heterozygosity across the entire CC population using a novel, simple and cost effective genotyping platform on three mice from each strain.

Most pathogenic activities of eCyPs are related to their chemotactic activity towards leukocytes, which is mediated by eCyP receptor on target cells, CD147, and involves peptydil-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins. This activity is inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA) and non-immunosuppressive derivatives of this drug. Accumulating evidence for the role of eCyPs in disease pathogenesis stimulated research on the mechanisms of eCyP-initiated events, resulting in identification of multiple signaling pathways, characterization of a variety of effector molecules released from eCyP-treated cells, and synthesis of CsA derivatives specifically blocking eCyPs. However, a number of important questions related to the mode of action of eCyPs remain unanswered. SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this article, we integrate available information on release and function of extracellular cyclophilins into a unified model, focusing on outstanding issues that need to be clarified. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular cyclophilins are critical players in pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory diseases. Their mechanism of action involves interaction with the receptor, CD147, and initiation of a poorly characterized signal transduction process culminating in chemotaxis and production of pro-inflammatory factors. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Extracellular cyclophilins present an attractive target for therapeutic interventions that can be used to alleviate symptoms and consequences of acute and chronic inflammation.","publish_time":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bukrinsky, Michael","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8aa983c0b271769d151b40c58bda6a3d3c0b47e8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7ac90f1783d9091eabfd12ff07568339440b21a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4436085.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4436085?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445705/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.11.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304416514003900; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416514003900","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CsA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of extracellular cyclophilins","role of eCyPs","number of inflammatory diseases","eCyP receptor","pathogenic activities of eCyPs","production of pro-inflammatory factors","mechanisms of eCyP","eCyP-treated cells","target cells","CD147","chemotactic activity","peptydil-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins","synthesis of CsA derivatives","number of important questions","disease pathogenesis stimulated research","attractive target","mode of action","mechanism of action","non-immunosuppressive derivatives","chemotaxis","critical players","characterization","unified model","characterized signal transduction process","variety of effector molecules","initiation","release","identification of multiple","available information","initiated events","MAJOR CONCLUSIONS","article","consequences of acute","pathways","interaction","chronic inflammation","therapeutic interventions","GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE","symptoms","outstanding issues","drug","Accumulating evidence","cyclosporine","leukocytes","BACKGROUND","SCOPE OF REVIEW"],"language":"en"},

Current methods to detect this mutation involve an end-point reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by nucleotide sequencing. While accurate, this approach has the limitation of being time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive. Herein we describe a one-step allelic discrimination assay which rapidly (2h) detects this resistance mutation. The sensitivity of the assay was as low as 10 copies per reaction and is capable of detecting the antiviral resistance mutation in a mixture of wild type H275 and mutant H275Y targets.","publish_time":"2008-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carr, Michael J.; Sayre, Naomi; Duffy, Margaret; Connell, Jeff; Hall, William W.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc3eba608f0a10ae1cd554724cddd65e2808b4b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112815.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18718489/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609340800253X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609340800253X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.07.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["antiviral resistance mutation","neuraminidase inhibitor","drug susceptibility surveillance of influenza viruses","neuraminidase active site","mutant H275Y targets","one-step allelic discrimination assay","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","mixture of wild type H275","Europe","tyrosine substitution","end","nucleotide sequencing","N1 nomenclature","subtype H1N1","limitation","copies","histidine","approach","winter season","oseltamivir","Abstract","sensitivity","Current methods"],"language":"en"},

To assess scientific advancements related to alternatives to antibiotics and provide actionable strategies to support their development, the United States Department of Agriculture, with support from the World Organisation for Animal Health, organized the second International Symposium on Alternatives to Antibiotics. It focused on six key areas: vaccines; microbial-derived products; non-nutritive phytochemicals; immune-related products; chemicals, enzymes, and innovative drugs; and regulatory pathways to enable the development and licensure of alternatives to antibiotics. This article, the second part in a two-part series, highlights new approaches and potential solutions for the development of vaccines as alternatives to antibiotics in food producing animals; opportunities, challenges and needs for the development of such vaccines are discussed in the first part of this series. As discussed in part 1 of this manuscript, many current vaccines fall short of ideal vaccines in one or more respects. Promising breakthroughs to overcome these limitations include new biotechnology techniques, new oral vaccine approaches, novel adjuvants, new delivery strategies based on bacterial spores, and live recombinant vectors; they also include new vaccination strategies in-ovo, and strategies that simultaneously protect against multiple pathogens. However, translating this research into commercial vaccines that effectively reduce the need for antibiotics will require close collaboration among stakeholders, for instance through public\u2013private partnerships. Targeted research and development investments and concerted efforts by all affected are needed to realize the potential of vaccines to improve animal health, safeguard agricultural productivity, and reduce antibiotic consumption and resulting resistance risks.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoelzer, Karin; Bielke, Lisa; Blake, Damer P.; Cox, Eric; Cutting, Simon M.; Devriendt, Bert; Erlacher-Vindel, Elisabeth; Goossens, Evy; Karaca, Kemal; Lemiere, Stephane; Metzner, Martin; Raicek, Margot; Collell Suri\u00F1ach, Miquel; Wong, Nora M.; Gay, Cyril; Van Immerseel, Filip","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0688fc392b60f5058c8dc02c9de55caaad8073f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6066917.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30060759/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-018-0561-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States Department of Agriculture","World Organisation for Animal Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of vaccines","antibiotics","potential of vaccines","current vaccines","commercial vaccines","new approaches","new delivery strategies","new vaccination strategies","short of ideal vaccines","development investments","Animal Health","actionable strategies","animal populations","licensure of alternatives","new biotechnology techniques","new oral vaccine approaches","alternative products","immune-related products","future success of animal agriculture","support","need","microbial-derived products","potential solutions","Targeted research","two-part series","United States Department of Agriculture","novel adjuvants","bacterial spores","non-nutritive phytochemicals","instance","limitations","food","antibiotic consumption","innovative drugs","live recombinant vectors","stakeholders","enzymes","agricultural productivity","close collaboration","animals","regulatory pathways","concerted efforts","World Organisation","International Symposium","challenges","opportunities","infectious diseases","ovo","key areas","private partnerships","resistance risks","manuscript","scientific advancements","Promising breakthroughs","multiple pathogens","respects","article"],"language":"en"},

Curative therapy incorporates surgery and is burdensome with high rates of infection morbidity and mortality. The role of yeast as causative organisms of post-esophagectomy infections is poorly defined. Consequently, the benefits of specific antifungal prophylactic therapy in improving patient outcome are unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the incidence of yeast infections at the University Medical Center Groningen among 565 post-esophagectomy patients between 1991 and 2017. The results show that 7.3% of the patients developed a yeast infection after esophageal resection with significantly increased incidence among patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. For patients with yeast infections, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, more frequent intensive care unit readmissions, prolonged hospital stays and higher mortality rates were observed. One-year survival was significantly lower for patients with a yeast infection, as well as diabetes mellitus and yeast-positive pleural effusion. We conclude that the incidence of yeast infections following esophagectomy is considerable, and that patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Furthermore, yeast infections are associated with higher complication rates and mortality. These observations encourage further prospective investigations on the possible benefits of antifungal prophylactic therapy for esophagectomy patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heuker, Marjolein; Koser, Usma; Ott, Alewijn; Karrenbeld, Arend; van Dijl, Jan Maarten; van Dam, Gooitzen M.; de Smet, Anne Marie G.

Our aim was to investigate the effects of thoracic trauma on the in-hospital course and outcome of patients with TBI. METHODS: We performed a matched pair analysis of the multicenter trauma database TraumaRegisterDGU\u00AE (TR-DGU) in the 5-year period from 2012 to 2016. We included adult patients (\u226518 years of age) with moderate to severe TBI (abbreviated injury scale (AIS)= 3\u20135). Patients with isolated TBI (group 1) were compared to patients with TBI and varying degrees of additional blunt thoracic trauma (AIS(Thorax)= 2\u20135) (group 2). Matching criteria were gender, age, severity of TBI, initial GCS and presence/absence of shock. The \u03C7(2)-test was used for comparing categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney-U-test was chosen for continuous parameters. Statistical significance was defined by a p-value \u003C 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 5414 matched pairs (10,828 patients) were included. The presence of additional thoracic injuries in patients with TBI was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and a prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. Additional thoracic trauma was also associated with higher mortality rates. These effects were most pronounced in thoracic AIS subgroups 4 and 5. Additional thoracic trauma, regardless of its severity (AIS(Thorax) \u22652) was associated with significantly decreased rates of good neurologic recovery (GOS = 5) after TBI. CONCLUSIONS: Chest trauma in general, regardless of its initial severity (AIS(Thorax)= 2\u20135), is associated with decreased chance of good neurologic recovery after TBI.

The research and development impact of developing countries on prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks has long been underestimated, particularly for emerging economies like China. Here, we studied its research and development progress and government support in response to Ebola outbreak by timeline, input, and output at each research and development stage. This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the research and development gaps and challenges faced by China, as well as providing evidence-based suggestions on how to accelerate the drug development process to meet urgent needs during future outbreaks. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Nature Science Foundation of China database, PubMed database, Patent Search System of the State Intellectual Property Office of China, National Medical Products Administration, national policy reports and literature between Jan 1st, 2006 and Dec 31st, 2017. An overview of research funding, research output, pharmaceutical product patent, and product licensed was described and analyzed by Microsoft Excel. A descriptive analysis with a visualization of plotting charts and graphs was conducted by reporting the mean \u00B1 standard deviation. RESULTS: China has successfully completed the research and development of the Ebola Ad5-EBOV vaccine within 26 months, while the preparation and implementation of clinical trials took relative long time. The National Nature Science Foundation of China funded CNY 44.05 million (USD 6.27 million) for Ebola-related researches and committed strongly to the phase of basic research (87.8%). A proliferation of literature arose between 2014 and 2015, with a 1.7-fold increase in drug research and a 2.5-fold increase in diagnostic research within 1 year. Three years on from the Ebola outbreak, six Ebola-related products in China were approved by the National Medical Products Administration. CONCLUSIONS: China has started to emphasize the importance of medical product innovation as one of the solutions for tackling emerging infectious diseases. Continuing research on the development of regulatory and market incentives, as well as a multilateral collaboration mechanism that unifies cross-channel supports, would advance the process for China to enter global R\u0026D market more effectively.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chao; Chen, Jing-Yi; Huang, Yang-Mu","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1110cec5ea652dbada933d96aa7b868a37b2498f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7069179.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7069179/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Patent Search System","Microsoft","National Medical Products Administration"],"locations":["Ebola","China"],"keyphrases":["research output","drug research","diagnostic research","Continuing research","global pharmaceutical research","overview of research funding","phase of basic research","development progress","development of regulatory","development gaps","development stage","Ebola outbreak","drug development process","National Nature Science Foundation of China database","Ebola-related products","National Medical Products Administration","Ebola-related researches","State Intellectual Property Office of China","development impact of developing countries","pharmaceutical product patent","national policy reports","Ebola Ad5-EBOV vaccine","global R","product licensed","importance of medical product innovation","fold increase","D market","emerging infectious diseases","PubMed database","control of infectious disease outbreaks","future outbreaks","market incentives","emerging economies","proliferation of literature","Patent Search System","relative long time","prevention","response","government support","implementation of clinical trials","urgent needs","powerful platform","months","solutions","timeline","CNY","visualization of plotting charts","input","deeper understanding","multilateral collaboration mechanism","graphs","preparation","cross-channel","challenges","descriptive analysis","mean","USD","evidence-based suggestions","standard deviation","study","years","Microsoft Excel","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The nucleoprotein (N) of VSV protects the viral genomic RNA and plays an essential role in viral transcription and replication, which makes the nucleoprotein an ideal target of host defense. However, whether and how host innate/intrinsic immunity limits VSV infection by targeting the N protein are unknown. In this study, we found that the N protein of VSV (VSV-N) interacted with a ubiquitin E3 ligase, tripartite motif protein 41 (TRIM41). Overexpression of TRIM41 inhibited VSV infection. Conversely, the depletion of TRIM41 increased host susceptibility to VSV. Furthermore, the E3 ligase defective mutant of TRIM41 failed to limit VSV infection, suggesting the requirement of the E3 ligase activity of TRIM41 in viral restriction. Indeed, TRIM41 ubiquitinated VSV-N in cells and in vitro. TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination leads to the degradation of VSV-N through proteasome, thereby limiting VSV infection. Taken together, our study identifies TRIM41 as a new intrinsic immune factor against VSV by targeting the viral nucleoprotein for ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patil, Girish; Xu, Lingling; Wu, Yakun; Song, Kun; Hao, Wenzhuo; Hua, Fang; Wang, Lingyan; Li, Shitao","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f1bfc20d5fa1896482283874f8b7971e51426ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7077221.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7077221/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N protein of VSV","degradation of VSV","TRIM41 ubiquitinated VSV-N","Overexpression of TRIM41 inhibited VSV infection","intrinsic immunity limits VSV infection","E3 ligase activity of TRIM41","TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination","viral nucleoprotein","E3 ligase defective mutant of TRIM41","depletion of TRIM41 increased host susceptibility","viral transcription","viral restriction","viral genomic RNA","ubiquitin E3 ligase","subsequent protein degradation","tripartite motif protein","study","negative-stranded RNA virus","ideal target of host defense","Vesicular stomatitis virus","new intrinsic immune factor","essential role","replication","requirement","proteasome","family Rhabdoviridae","cells"],"language":"en"},

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All respiratory specimens were tested in culture, indirect immunofluorescence assay, and PCR or RT-PCR for virological assessment. Patients were followed until ICU discharge or death. One hundred thirty-nine patients were included. Upon enrollment, a respiratory virus was detected in the tracheobronchial aspirate in 25% of patients (35 of 139).

However, the immunogenic potential and efficiency of exosomes-based tumor vaccine are not satisfactory enough to achieve a curative effect in clinical trials. In this article we investigated whether IL-18 genetic modification of tumor cells can increase the efficacy of exosomes derived from IL-18 gene-modified tumor cells. We transfected carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing tumor cells with a recombinant adenovirus encoding human IL-18 (AdhIL-18) and prepared the exosomes, Exo/IL-18, from IL-18 gene-modified tumor cells. We found that Exo/IL-18 naturally contain CEA and bioactive IL-18. Moreover, Exo-IL-18 are potent in chemoattracting DC and T cells, enhancing the proliferation and Th1 cytokine release of PBMC, and promoting the phenotypic and functional maturation of DC. Furthermore, Exo/IL-18-pulsed DC are quite potent to induce HLA-A*0201-restricted, CEA-specific CD8(\u002B) CTL from the PBMC of HLA-A*0201 CEA(\u002B) cancer patients in vitro. In almost all of these experiments, Exo/IL-18 show more potent functions than the conventionally prepared exosomes derived from parent tumor cells without IL-18 gene modification. Our findings suggest that Exo/IL-18 has more potent capability to induce specific anti-tumor immunity, and our strategy of IL-18 modification of exosomes is a feasible approach to develop exosomes-based tumor vaccines.","publish_time":"2006-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dai, Shengming; Zhou, Xiangyang; Wang, Baomei; Wang, Qingqing; Fu, Yangxin; Chen, Taoyong; Wan, Tao; Yu, Yizhi; Cao, Xuetao","journal":"J Mol Med (Berl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7cdd1401f92aa073bd886ef3025e77792da5875.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079873.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzU3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Exo/IL","CEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Exo-IL","tumor-derived exosomes","human IL","strategy of IL","bioactive IL","parent tumor cells","gene-modified tumor cells","genetic modification of tumor cells","exosomes-based tumor vaccines","modification of exosomes","prepared exosomes","specific anti-tumor immunity","efficiency of exosomes","T cells","efficacy of exosomes","Dendritic cells","gene modification","CEA-specific CD8","potent capability","potent functions","chemoattracting DC","pulsed DC","functional maturation of DC","PBMC of HLA","Th1 cytokine release of PBMC","population of nanometer sized membrane vesicles","proliferation","feasible approach","recombinant adenovirus","curative effect","CTL","immunogenic potential","clinical trials","carcinoembryonic antigen","cancer patients","AdhIL","experiments","findings","article"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: University hospital intensive care unit, caring solely for patients with SARS or suspected to have SARS. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five doctors and 152 nurses and healthcare assistants who worked in the ICU during the SARS epidemic. Interventions: Infection control measures designed to prevent transmission of disease to staff were implemented. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with SARS were admitted to the intensive care unit. Four nurses and one healthcare assistant contracted SARS, with three of these developing symptoms within 10 days of admission of the first patient with SARS. Doctors were exposed to patients with SARS for a median (IQR) of 284 (97\u2013376) h, while nurses and healthcare assistants were exposed for a median (IQR) of 119 (57\u2013166) h.

To prepare soluble and bioactive recombinant human FGF23 to meet the increasing demand in its pharmacological application, small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-FGF23 fusion gene and FGF23 non-fusion gene were amplified by standard PCR methods and cloned into vector pET-22b and pET-3c, then transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) and BL21 (DE3). The best combination of plasmid and host strain was screened, and only Rosetta (DE3)/pET-SUMO-FGF23 was screened for rhFGF23 protein expressed. The average bacterial yield and the soluble expression level of recombinant hFGF23 of three batches attained 687 \u00B1 18 g and 30 \u00B1 1.5%, respectively, after treatment with 0.4 mM isopropyl-thio-\u03B2-galactopyranoside for 19 h at 16 \u00B0C in a 30-L fermentor, after which it was purified by DEAE Sepharose FF and nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Once cleaved by the SUMO protease, the recombinant human FGF23 was released from the fusion protein. The purity of rFGF23 was shown by high performance liquid chromatography to be greater than 90% and the yield was 60 \u00B1 1.5 mg/L. In vitro data showed that the purified rFGF23 can induce the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in the glioma U251 cell. The results of in vivo animal experiments also showed that rFGF23 could decrease the concentration in the plasma of normal rats fed with a fixed formula diet.

Recently two procedures have been developed to recover the time-dependent transmission function, \u03B2(t), for classical disease models given the disease incidence data. We first review the \u03B2(t) recovery procedures and give the resulting formulas, using both methods, for the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) models. We present a modification of one procedure, which is then shown to be identical to the other. Second, we explore several technical issues that appear when implementing the procedure for the SIR model; these are important when generating the time-dependent transmission function for real-world disease data. Third, we extend the recovery method to heterogeneous populations modeled with a certain SIR-type model with multiple time-dependent transmission functions. Finally, we apply the \u03B2(t) recovery procedure to data from the 2002\u20132003 influenza season and for the six seasons from 2002\u20132003 through 2007\u20132008, for both one population class and for two age classes. We discuss the consequences of the technical conditions of the procedure applied to the influenza data.

We present and analyze a dynamic compartmental model for multiple serotypes exhibiting ADE. Using center manifold techniques, we show how the dynamics rapidly collapses to a lower dimensional system.

In this paper, we develop a seasonally perturbed Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model of avian influenza in a seabird colony. Numerical simulations of the model give rise to chaotic recurrent epidemics for parameters that reflect the ecology of avian influenza in a seabird population, thereby providing a case study for chaos in a host\u2013 pathogen system. We give a computer-assisted exposition of the existence of chaos in the model using methods that are based on the concept of topological hyperbolicity. Our approach elucidates the geometry of the chaos in the phase space of the model, thereby offering a mechanism for the persistence of the infection.

Influenza virus (C/Miyagi/77) reacted with BSM efficiently, however reacted with p-NiA weakly, but not with \u03B1-NA at all. Thus, the AE-reactivity of DVIM was distinctly different from that of MHV-S and influenza C virus, suggesting that the AE of HE may have a modified function. Isolation of HE by the treatment with non ionic detergent NP40, resulted in globules approximately 5 nm in diameter. DVIM-binding proteins were demonstrated in the plasma membrane of mouse intestinal brush-border cells and hepatocytes. The same protein was recognized by MHV-S and MHV-4. The cell membranes obtained from these target tissues were substrates for the AE of DVIM. The biological importance of the HE protein for DVIM is discussed.","publish_time":"2014-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sugiyama, K.; Kasai, M.; Kato, S.; Kasai, H.; Hatakeyama, K.","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9aeada9f8181ee2edb3301898299a4241765a1a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozc4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DVIM","MHV","AE","BSM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AE of DVIM","MHV-S","synthetic substrates p-NiA","activity of DVIM","\u03B1-naphthylacetate","AE-reactivity","strains of MHV","synthetic substrates p-nitrophenylacetate","influenza C virus","DVIM-binding proteins","influenza viruses","O-acetylester bond of BSM","diarrhea virus of infant mice","substrate specificity","natural substrate bovine submaxillary mucin","plasma membrane of mouse intestinal brush-border cells","globules","target tissues","treatment","ionic detergent NP40","hepatocytes","Miyagi","cell membranes","acetylesterase","haemagglutinin-esterase","biological importance","nm","diameter","modified function","Isolation"],"language":"en"},

Here, we briefly describe recent reports in the literature concentrating on infectious disease control. The focus of this review is to describe the molecular methods widely used in the diagnosis, prevention, and control of infectious diseases with regard to the innovation of molecular techniques. Since the list of pathogenic microorganisms is extensive, we emphasize some of the major human infectious diseases (AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, rotavirus, herpes virus, viral hepatitis, and dengue fever). As a consequence of these developments, infectious diseases will be more accurately and effectively treated; safe and effective vaccines are being developed and rapid detection of infectious agents now permits countermeasures to avoid potential outbreaks and epidemics.

In this article, we will review the progress of structural proteomics initiatives targeting the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the etiological agent of the 2003 worldwide epidemic that culminated in approximately 8,000 cases and 800 deaths. The SARS-CoV genome encodes 28 proteins in three distinct classes, many of them with unknown function and sharing low similarity to other proteins. The structures of 16 SARS-CoV proteins or functional domains have been determined to date. Remarkably, eight of these 16 proteins or functional domains have novel folds, indicating the uniqueness of the coronavirus proteins. The results of SARS-CoV structural proteomics initiatives will have several profound biological impacts, including elucidation of the structure\u2013function relationships of coronavirus proteins; identification of targets for the design of anti-viral compounds against SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses; and addition of new protein folds to the fold space, with further understanding of the structure\u2013function relationships for several new protein families.

Up to 104 cDNA clones of eight viruses were obtained by reverse transcription PCR with different pairs of primers designed for each virus and a pair of universal primers designed for the RNA polymerase gene of coronavirus. Total RNAs extracted from virus were reverse transcribed, followed by multi-PCR amplification and labeled with Cy3-dCTP. All labeled cDNAs and prepared gene chips were subjected to specific hybridization. The results showed that extensive cross-reaction existed between CCoV, FCoV, FIPV, TGEV and PRCoV, while there was no cross-reaction between BCoV, TCoV and HRCoV. The ultimate specific gene chip was developed with DNA fragments reamplified from the chosen recombinant plasmids without cross-reaction between different coronaviruses.

In the current study we use next-generation sequencing to investigate the DWV quasispecies in an apiary known to suffer from overwintering colony losses. We show that the DWV species complex is made up of three master variants. Our results indicate that a new DWV Type C variant is distinct from the previously described types A and B, but together they form a distinct clade compared with other members of the Iflaviridae. The molecular clock estimation predicts that Type C diverged from the other variants \u223C319 years ago.

Nevertheless, the level of implementation of biosecurity measures (BSM) remains largely insufficient due to certain constraints. It is therefore necessary to prioritize the different BSM to be applied in accordance with the individual context and the main infectious diseases affecting cattle. Previous prioritization exercises of infectious diseases were neither specific to Belgium nor based on an exhaustive list of diseases. This study aimed at classifying the most important infectious diseases affecting cattle in Belgium. A list of 74 cattle infectious diseases reported in Europe was compiled based on a literature review. Through an online survey, Belgian rural veterinary practitioners (RVP) were asked to assign a score to each disease according to their frequency (question 1), their trends estimated between 2013\u201015 (question 2), and finally to list the five most important diseases for adult cattle (question 3). Respectively, 107 and 93 RVP answered the first two questions and the last one. Results of the survey were used to classify the diseases based on their frequency, trends, and importance through an additional weighting system and a subsequent regression tree analysis. Belgian laboratory databases and previous disease prioritization exercises were also analysed and taken into account as additional data sources. For the most important diseases identified (those ranked as important by the three data sources), a literature review was performed in PubMed to identify their related risk factors and BSM.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause of IM, followed by cytomegalovirus (CMV). Given that serological testing is associated with limitations regarding its accuracy, availability, and time to receive results, clinical differentiation based on symptoms, signs, and basic tests would be useful. We evaluated whether clinical findings could be used to differentiate EBV-IM from CMV-IM. Methods In this single-center retrospective case-control study, we evaluated \u003E14-year-old patients with serologically confirmed EBV-IM or CMV-IM during 2006\u20132017. We compared the patients\u2019 symptoms, physical findings, blood counts, and serum biomarkers to create three regression models: model 1 (symptoms and signs), model 2 (model 1 plus sonographic hepatosplenomegaly and blood counts), and model 3 (model 2 plus hepatobiliary biomarkers). Results Among the 122 patients (72.6%) with EBV-IM and 46 patients (27.4%) with CMV-IM, the median age was 25 years and 82 patients (48.8%) were male. The median age was 10 years older in the CMV-IM group (p \u003C 0.001) and the median interval from onset to visit was 5 days longer in the CMV-IM group (p \u003C 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that EBV-IM was predicted by younger age, short onset-to-visit interval, lymphadenopathy, tonsillar white coat, hepatosplenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis, and elevations of lactate dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. All regression models had areas under the curve of \u003E0.9. Conclusion History and physical findings, especially when used with atypical lymphocytosis and sonographic hepatosplenomegaly, can help physicians differentiate EBV-IM from CMV-IM.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ishii, Takamasa; Sasaki, Yosuke; Maeda, Tadashi; Komatsu, Fumiya; Suzuki, Takeshi; Urita, Yoshihisa","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a523866ce506078aa6ac5af39ce7edb135787093.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128249.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2019.01.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30773381/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X19300315; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X19300315","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMV-IM group","confirmed EBV-IM","common cause of IM","median age","young patients","year-old patients","sonographic hepatosplenomegaly","physical findings","regression models","clinical findings","median interval","blood counts","atypical lymphocytosis","patients\u2019 symptoms","lymphadenopathy","signs","younger age","Logistic regression","results","years older","serum biomarkers","short onset","clinical differentiation","hepatobiliary biomarkers","common viral infection","tonsillar white coat","elevations of lactate dehydrogenase","single-center retrospective case-control study","time","fever","pharyngitis","physicians","gamma-glutamyl transferase","Abstract Introduction Infectious mononucleosis","limitations","availability","basic tests","accuracy","Methods","Epstein-Barr virus","Conclusion History","areas","curve","cytomegalovirus","days","serological testing","male"],"language":"en"},

We provide evidence for four genetically distinct clades with separate origins currently circulating in the Middle East and surrounding countries. Introductions of these viruses have been followed by regular and multidirectional trans-boundary movements in some parts of the region, but relative isolation in others.

Microfluidics is capable of analyzing small sample volumes (10(\u22129)\u201310(\u221218) l) and minimizing costly reagent consumption as well as automating sample preparation and reducing processing time. The merger of microfluidics and advanced biosensor technologies offers new promises for POC diagnostics, including high-throughput analysis, portability and disposability. However, this merger also imposes technological challenges on biosensors, such as high sensitivity and selectivity requirements with sample volumes orders of magnitude smaller than those of conventional practices, false response errors due to non-specific adsorption, and integrability with other necessary modules. There have been many prior review articles on microfluidic-based biosensors, and this review focuses on the recent progress in last 5 years. Herein, we review general technologies of DNA and protein biosensors. Then, recent advances on the coupling of the biosensors to microfluidics are highlighted. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and potential solutions for transforming microfluidic biosensors into POC diagnostic applications.","publish_time":"2010-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Seokheun; Goryll, Michael; Sin, Lai Yi Mandy; Wong, Pak Kin; Chae, Junseok","journal":"Microfluid Nanofluidics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5052f0ebf6ba03e6e23c1b89ca07330ef916c4a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087901.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10404-010-0638-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214951/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein biosensors","microfluidic-based biosensors","POC diagnostics","merger of microfluidics","state-of-the-art microfluidic biosensors of nucleic acids","small sample volumes","automating sample preparation","POC diagnostic applications","prior review articles","sample volumes orders of magnitude smaller","high sensitivity","key challenges","technological challenges","recent progress","recent advances","advanced biosensor technologies","high-throughput analysis","general technologies of DNA","new promises","selectivity requirements","false response errors","conventional practices","proteins","non-specific adsorption","potential solutions","point","integrability","portability","costly reagent consumption","processing time","care","coupling","disposability","necessary modules","years"],"language":"en"},

We attribute these differences in large part to the duration of the trip. Subjective trip characteristics, such as safety and convenience, also play important roles. The trip duration explains rush-hour effects as well as why people starting from less affluent and more difficult-to-reach places are less satisfied with their trips. Longer-term policy options suggested by these results include infrastructure developments and spatial development strategies.

Here, 336 diarrhoeic samples were collected from yaks on 29 farms in the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau from 2015 to 2017. Approximately 69.05 % (232/336) of the diarrhoeic samples were assessed as bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-positive by RT-PCR assay, and most of the detected strains showed a unique evolution based on 40 spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene fragments. Notably, the 12 complete S genes detected shared 1 identical amino acid mutation (E121V) in the S1 subunit compared with the other 150 complete S genes in the GenBank database. Furthermore, a BCoV strain (designated YAK/HY24/CH/2017) was isolated from one diarrhoeic sample (virus titre : 10(8.17)TCID(50) ml(\u22121)), and a phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome sequences revealed that strain YAK/HY24/CH/2017 has the closest genetic relationship with the BCoV prototype strain Mebus. Interestingly, 2 significant characteristics were observed in the genome of strain YAK/HY24/CH/2017 : (1) the strain had 26 unique amino acid variations in the S gene compared with the other 150 BCoV S genes in the GenBank database and (2) a recombination event was identified between the esterase and lectin domains of the HE gene. In conclusion, this study revealed the high prevalence of BCoV in yaks in the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of the molecular prevalence of BCoV in yaks and of a BCoV genome with an HE gene recombination.","publish_time":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Qifu; Guo, Zijing; Zhang, Bin; Yue, Hua; Tang, Cheng","journal":"Journal of General Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fa016ea79f0335c18d32e730c75c58a34db8184.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079584.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30932810/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GenBank"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCoV strain","BCoV genome","BCoV S genes","genome of strain YAK","complete S genes","BCoV prototype strain Mebus","high prevalence of BCoV","molecular prevalence of BCoV","yaks","Qinghai","HY24","gene recombination","Tibet Plateau","designated YAK","gene fragments","diarrhoeic samples","complete genome sequences","unique amino acid variations","unique evolution","GenBank database","unique domestic bovine species","identical amino acid mutation","bovine coronavirus","haemagglutinin-esterase","recombination event","detected strains","E121V","closest genetic relationship","indispensable role","herdsmen","nucleocapsid","phylogenetic analysis","description","study","spike","Bosgrunniens","farms","RT-PCR assay","virus titre","S1 subunit","lectin domains","knowledge","conclusion","significant characteristics","best","TCID"],"language":"en"},

We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5 and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P=0.0174), supporting that DPP4 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular factors in determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin.","publish_time":"2018-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Susanna K.

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Randhawa, Gurjit S.; Soltysiak, Maximillian P.M.; Roz, Hadi El; de Souza, Camila P.E.; Hill, Kathleen A.; Kari, Lila","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c22fa9184706d02c9386c14659c0fe647a8c44e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bb8e3d331bb2975e1c644c8729b842797da2d626.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.932350","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome machine-learning approach","intrinsic COVID","confirmed cases","supervised machine learning","machine learning component","machine learning-based alignment-free approach","genome analyses","accurate classification","genome annotations","viral genomes","cases likely","pathogen genome sequences","unique viral genomic sequences","virus genomic sequence","genomic signature","deaths","novel coronavirus","death rate","outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification","high levels of classification accuracy","decision tree approach","bat origin","proposed method","infamous SARS coronavirus","raw DNA sequence data","digital signal processing","Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient analysis","ab initio","training","gene","strategic planning","result validation","reliable real-time option","minutes","specialized biological knowledge","relevant relationships","containment","large dataset","longer incubation period","treatment","hypothesis","results","Sarbecovirus","paper","weeks","Betacoronavirus","tools","countries"],"language":"en"},

Reported residential postcode was used to locate cases, and clusters were identified using a scan statistic. Cases included in clusters were compared to those not included in such clusters with respect to human socioeconomic factors (postcode area relative socioeconomic disadvantage, economic resources, education and occupation) and dog factors (neuter status, breed, age, gender, vaccination status). During 2010, there were 1187 cases of canine parvovirus reported. Nineteen significant (P \u003C0.05) disease clusters were identified, most commonly located in New South Wales. Eleven (58%) clusters occurred between April and July, and the average cluster length was 5.7days. All clusters occurred in postcodes with a significantly (P \u003C0.05) greater level of relative socioeconomic disadvantage and a lower rank in education and occupation, and it was noted that clustered cases were less likely to have been neutered (P =0.004). No significant difference (P \u003E0.05) was found between cases reported from cluster postcodes and those not within clusters for dog age, gender, breed or vaccination status (although the latter needs to be interpreted with caution, since vaccination was absent in most of the cases). Further research is required to investigate the apparent association between indicators of poor socioeconomic status and clusters of reported canine parvovirus diseases; however these initial findings may be useful for developing geographically- and temporally-targeted prevention and disease control programs.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brady, S.; Norris, J.

In this context, both data collection on sexual contact networks and the modeling of disease spreading, are intensively contributing to the search for effective immunization policies. Here, the spreading of sexually transmitted diseases on bipartite scale-free graphs, representing heterosexual contact networks, is considered. We analytically derive the expression for the epidemic threshold and its dependence with the system size in finite populations. We show that the epidemic outbreak in bipartite populations, with number of sexual partners distributed as in empirical observations from national sex surveys, takes place for larger spreading rates than for the case in which the bipartite nature of the network is not taken into account. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the theoretical results. Our findings indicate that the restriction to crossed infections between the two classes of individuals (males and females) has to be taken into account in the design of efficient immunization strategies for sexually transmitted diseases.","publish_time":"2007-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gomez-Gardenes, J.; Latora, V.; Moreno, Y.; Profumo, E.

Local idiosyncrasies prevent a single prescriptive strategy. However, general considerations can be applied to most practice environments. A comprehensive strategy will include consideration of local COVID-19 statistics; availability of personal protective equipment (PPE); local, state, and federal government mandates; institutional regulatory guidance; local safety measures; health care worker availability; patient and health care worker risk factors; factors specific to the indication(s) for radiology care; and examination or procedure acuity. An accurate risk-benefit analysis of postponing versus performing a given routine radiology examination or procedure often is not possible due to many unknown and complex factors.

Systematic survey of current practices and methods","doi":"10.1186/s12961-018-0327-8","pmcid":"PMC6044042","pubmed_id":"30005712","license":"cc-by","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Guidelines in the healthcare field generally should contain evidence-based recommendations to inform healthcare decisions. Guidelines often require 2 years or more to develop, but certain circumstances necessitate the development of rapid guidelines (RGs) in a short period of time. Upholding methodological rigor while meeting the reduced development timeframe presents a challenge for developing RGs. Our objective was to review current practices and standards for the development of RGs. This is the first of a series of three articles addressing methodological issues around RGs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic survey of methods manuals and published RGs to identify reasons for the development of RGs. Data sources included existing guideline manuals, published RGs, Trip Medical Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE and communication with guideline developers until February 2018. RESULTS: We identified 46 guidelines that used a shortened timeframe for their development. Nomenclature describing RGs varied across organisations, wherein the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produced \u2018Interim Guidelines\u2019, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom developed \u2018Short Clinical Guidelines\u2019, and WHO provided \u2018Rapid Advice\u2019. The rationale for RGs included response to emergencies, rapid increases in cases of a condition or disease severity, or new evidence regarding treatment. In general, the methods to assess the quality of evidence, the consensus process and the management of the conflict of interest were not always clear. While we identified another 11 RGs from other institutions, there was no reference to timeframe and reasons for conducting a RG. The three organisations mentioned above provide guidance for the development of RGs. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of standardised nomenclature and definitions regarding RGs and there is inconsistency in the methods described in manuals and in RG. It is therefore important that all RGs provide a detailed and transparent description of their methods in order for readers and end-users to be able to assess their quality and validate their findings.

However, rapid diagnosis and identification of high-risk patients for early intervention are challenging. Using a large computed Tomography (CT) database from 4,154 patients, we developed an AI system that can diagnose NCP and differentiate it from other common pneumonia and normal controls. The AI system can assist radiologists and physicians in performing a quick diagnosis especially when the health system is overloaded. Significantly, our AI system identified important clinical markers that correlated with the NCP lesion properties. Together with the clinical data, our AI system was able to provide accurate clinical prognosis that can aid clinicians to consider appropriate early clinical management and allocate resources appropriately. We have made this AI system available globally to assist the clinicians to combat COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Kang; Liu, Xiaohong; Shen, Jun; Li, Zhihuan; Sang, Ye; Wu, Xingwang; Cha, Yunfei; Liang, Wenhua; Wang, Chengdi; Wang, Ke; Ye, Linsen; Gao, Ming; Zhou, Zhongguo; Li, Liang; Wang, Jin; Yang, Zhizhong; Cai, Huimin; Xu, Jie; Yang, Lei; Cai, Wenjia; Xu, Wenqin; Wu, Shaoxu; Zhang, Wei; Jiang, Shanping; Zheng, Lianghong; Zhang, Xuan; Wang, Li; Lu, Liu; Li, Jiaming; Wu, Haiying; Wang, Winston; Li, Oulan; Zhang, Charlotte; Liang, Liang; Wu, Tao; Deng, Ruiyun; Wei, Kang; Zhou, Yong; Chen, Ting; Yiu-Nam Lau, Johnson; Fok, Manson; He, Jianxing; Lin, Tianxin; Li, Weimin; Wang, Guangyu","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7741fed9483bc46c587cdfff414d435b1799dab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416069/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867420305511; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420305511?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AI system available","health system","clinical data","clinicians","accurate clinical prognosis","appropriate early clinical management","important clinical markers","common pneumonia","COVID","identification of high-risk patients","novel coronavirus pneumonia","NCP lesion properties","early intervention","quick diagnosis","rapid diagnosis","CT","database","physicians","large computed Tomography","SARS-CoV","resources","radiologists","normal controls","Summary","respiratory failure"],"language":"en"}]}

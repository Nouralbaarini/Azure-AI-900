METHODS: Populations of 36 fungi were measured in sinus samples and in the home vacuum cleaner dust of CRS (n = 73) and non\u2010CRS patients (n = 16) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Etest strips containing amphotericin B, anidulafungin, caspofungin, fluconazole, and voriconazole were used to test the susceptibility of seven potentially relevant fungi. RESULTS: Seven fungi (Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides types 1 and 2, Cladosporium herbarum, Penicillium brevicompactum, Penicillium crustosum, and Penicillium chrysogenum type 2) were discovered at very high concentrations in some CRS patients. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of these seven fungi demonstrated species specific sensitivities. Four CRS patients with marked elevations of fungal populations in their sinus samples underwent endoscopic sinus surgery. After surgical treatment, the fungal populations were reduced by several orders of magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: Seven fungi were found in very high concentrations in the sinuses of some CRS patients.

Zoonoses represent an additional threat to public health because the natural reservoirs are often animals, particularly wildlife, thus eluding control efforts such as quarantine, vaccination and social distancing. As there are limited resources available, it is necessary to prioritize diseases in order to allocate resources to those posing the greatest public health threat. Many studies have attempted to prioritize zoonoses, but challenges exist. This study uses a quantitative approach, conjoint analysis (CA), to overcome some limitations of traditional disease prioritization exercises. We used CA to conduct a zoonoses prioritization study involving a range of human and animal health professionals across North America; these included epidemiologists, public health practitioners, research scientists, physicians, veterinarians, laboratory technicians and nurses. A total of 699 human health professionals (HHP) and 585 animal health professionals (AHP) participated in this study. We used CA to prioritize 62 zoonotic diseases using 21 criteria. Our findings suggest CA can be used to produce reasonable criteria scores for disease prioritization. The fitted models were satisfactory for both groups with a slightly better fit for AHP compared to HHP (84.4% certainty fit versus 83.6%). Human\u2010related criteria were more influential for HHP in their decision to prioritize zoonoses, while animal\u2010related criteria were more influential for AHP resulting in different disease priority lists. While the differences were not statistically significant, a difference of one or two ranks could be considered important for some individuals. A potential solution to address the varying opinions is discussed. The scientific framework for disease prioritization presented can be revised on a regular basis by updating disease criteria to reflect diseases as they evolve over time; such a framework is of value allowing diseases of highest impact to be identified routinely for resource allocation.","publish_time":"2015-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, V.; Sargeant, J.

Morphological examination of these species has defined six phenotypic groups that are commonly used in characterizations of taxonomic hypotheses. We used a molecular phylogeny based on four mitochondrial and two nuclear genes to assess the group\u0027s biogeographical history in the archipelago and examine the phylogenetic validity of the currently recognized Philippine species groups. We re\u2010examined traditional characters used to define species groups and used multivariate statistics to quantitatively evaluate group structure in morphometric space. Clustering analyses of phenotypic similarity indicate that some (but not all) members of previously defined species groups are phenotypically most similar to other members of the same group. However, when species group membership was mapped on our partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis, only one species group corresponds to a clade; all other species group arrangements are strongly rejected by our phylogeny. Our results demonstrate that (1) previously recognized species group relationships were misled by phenotypic convergence; (2) Sphenomorphus is widely paraphyletic; and (3) multiple lineages have independently invaded the Philippines. Based on this new perspective on the phylogenetic relationships of Philippine Sphenomorphus, we revise the archipelago\u0027s diverse assemblage of species at the generic level, and resurrect and/or expand four previously recognized genera, and describe two new genera to accommodate the diversity of Philippine skinks of the Sphenomorphus group. \u00A9 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 163, 1217\u20131243.","publish_time":"2011-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"LINKEM, CHARLES W.; DIESMOS, ARVIN C.; BROWN, RAFE M.","journal":"Zool J Linn Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/772e1f84b4ee3a057fd1f596f6257c2e156f980e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165859.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165859/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Philippine","Philippine Sphenomorphus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species group membership","species group arrangements","Sphenomorphus group","recognized species group relationships","recognized Philippine species groups","defined species groups","group structure","phenotypic groups","phylogenetic relationships of Philippine Sphenomorphus","archipelago\u0027s diverse assemblage of species","Philippine Archipelago","genus Sphenomorphus","recognized genera","diversity of Philippine skinks","phylogenetic validity","new genera","phenotypic convergence","diverse clade of squamates","Linnean Society of London","partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis","new perspective","Clustering analyses of phenotypic similarity","molecular phylogeny","Zoological Journal","multivariate statistics","group\u0027s biogeographical history","nuclear genes","generic level","morphometric space","traditional characters","multiple lineages","characterizations of taxonomic hypotheses","Philippines","Morphological examination","results"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 differ from TLR4 in two particularly important ways for antiviral immunity: they can be activated by nucleic acid agonists mimicking compounds produced during the viral cycle, and they are typically present within the cell, along the endocytic pathway, where they sense viral products in the intraluminal space. Investigations in mice have demonstrated that the TLR7/9\u2013IFN and TLR3\u2013IFN pathways are different and critical for protective immunity to various experimental viral infections. Investigations in humans with interleukin\u20101 receptor\u2010associated kinase\u20104 (IRAK\u20104) deficiency (unresponsive to TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9), UNC\u201093B deficiency (unresponsive to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9), and TLR3 deficiency have recently shed light on the role of these two pathways in antiviral immunity in natural conditions. UNC\u201093B\u2010 and TLR3\u2010deficient patients appear to be specifically prone to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV\u20101) encephalitis, although clinical penetrance is incomplete, whereas IRAK\u20104\u2010deficient patients appear to be normally resistant to most viruses, including HSV\u20101. These experiments of nature suggest that the TLR7\u2010, TLR8\u2010, and TLR9\u2010dependent induction of IFN\u2010\u03B1, IFN\u2010\u03B2, and IFN\u2010\u03BB is largely redundant in human antiviral immunity, whereas the TLR3\u2010dependent induction of IFN\u2010\u03B1, IFN\u2010\u03B2, and IFN\u2010\u03BB is critical for primary immunity to HSV\u20101 in the central nervous system in children but redundant for immunity to most other viral infections.","publish_time":"2007-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Shen\u2010Ying; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle; Sancho\u2010Shimizu, Vanessa; Von Bernuth, Horst; Yang, Kun; Abel, Laurent; Picard, Capucine; Puel, Anne; Casanova, Jean\u2010Laurent","journal":"Immunol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/314a3535659c2286312b5ad2fae81ed55e518173.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165931.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165931/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TLR7","IFN pathways","TLR9","TLR3 deficiency","dependent induction of IFN","TLR8","human antiviral immunity","protective immunity","primary immunity","TLR4","HSV","B deficiency","viral products","viral cycle","IRAK","various experimental viral infections","deficient patients","UNC","Investigations","human Toll","mouse TLRs","interleukin","compounds","central nervous system","children","clinical penetrance","associated kinase","encephalitis","herpes simplex virus","role","shed light","receptors","natural conditions","important ways","interferon","endocytic pathway","nucleic acid agonists","cell","humans","intraluminal space","viruses","experiments of nature","mice","Summary"],"language":"en"},

Liver mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from liver specimens obtained from the patients during abdominal surgery. In addition to a flow cytometric analysis, liver MNC and PBMC were cultured with the immobilized anti\u2010CD3 Ab, IL\u20102, or a combination of IL\u20102 and IL\u201012 and their IFN\u2010\u03B3 production and the antitumor cytotoxicity were assessed.

The proportion of NK cells also decreased in the cirrhotic livers. On the other hand, the populations of these cells in PBMC did not significantly differ among patient groups. The IFN\u2010\u03B3 production and the cytotoxicity against K562 cells, Raji cells, and a hepatocellular carcinoma, HuH\u20107 cells, greatly decreased in the cirrhotic liver MNC. In contrast, the cytotoxicity in PBMC did not significantly differ among the patient groups and was lower than that in the liver MNC of HCV (\u2212) patients.

Little is known about the regulation or pattern of expression of ACE2 in the mouse lung, including its definitive cellular distribution or developmental changes. Based on Northern blot and RT\u2010PCR data, we report two distinct transcripts of ACE2 in the mouse lung and kidney and describe a 5\u2032 exon 1a previously unidentified in the mouse. Western blots show multiple isoforms of ACE2, with predominance of a 75\u201380 kDa protein in the mouse lung versus a 120 kDa form in the mouse kidney. Immunohistochemistry localizes ACE2 protein to Clara cells, type II cells, and endothelium and smooth muscle of small and medium vessels in the mouse lung. ACE2 mRNA levels peak at embryonic day 18.5 in the mouse lung, and immunostaining demonstrates protein primarily in the bronchiolar epithelium at that developmental time point. In murine cell lines ACE2 is strongly expressed in the Clara cell line mtCC, as opposed to the low mRNA expression detected in E10 (type I\u2010like alveolar epithelial cell line), MLE\u201015 (type II alveolar epithelial cell line), MFLM\u20104 (fetal pulmonary vasculature cell line), and BUMPT\u20107 (renal proximal tubule cell line). In summary, murine pulmonary ACE2 appears to be primarily epithelial, is developmentally regulated, and has two transcripts that include a previously undescribed exon. J. Cell.

During three consecutive winter\u2010spring seasons, 49 symptomatic lung transplant recipients with suspected respiratory viral infection, and 26 asymptomatic patients were investigated for presence of respiratory viruses either in 56 nasopharyngeal aspirate or 72 bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken at different times after transplantation. On the whole, 1 asymptomatic (3.4%) and 28 symptomatic (57.1%) patients were positive for human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 4 patients), influenza virus A (3 patients), and B (2 patients), respiratory syncytial virus (2 patients), human coronavirus (2 patients), human parainfluenza virus (2 patients), rhinovirus (5 patients), while 4 patients were coinfected by 2 respiratory viruses, and 5 were infected sequentially by 2 or more respiratory viruses. In bronchoalveolar lavage samples, hMPV predominated by far over the other viruses, being responsible for 60% of positive specimens, whereas other viruses were present in nasopharyngeal aspirates at a comparable rate. RT\u2010PCR (detecting 43 positive samples/128 examined) was largely superior to monoclonal antibodies (detecting 17 positive samples only). In addition, HCMV was detected in association with a respiratory virus in 4/18 HCMV\u2010positive patients, and was found at a high concentration (\u003E10(5) DNA copies/ml) in 3/16 (18.7%) patients with HCMV\u2010positive bronchoalveolar lavage samples and pneumonia. Coinfections and sequential infections by HCMV and respiratory viruses were significantly more frequent in patients with acute rejection and steroid treatment. In conclusion: (i) about 50% of respiratory tract infections of lung transplant recipients were associated with one or more respiratory viruses; (ii) hMPV largely predominates in bronchoalveolar lavage of symptomatic lung transplant recipients, thus suggesting a causative role in lower respiratory tract infections; (iii) RT\u2010PCR appears to be the method of choice for detection of respiratory viruses in lung transplant recipients, (iv) a high HCMV load in bronchoalveolar lavage is a risk factor for viral pneumonia, suggesting some measure of intervention for the control of viral infection.

Which functional traits best distinguish the weed communities of more and less extensively managed fields? Can the same traits predict the rarity of individual weed species? LOCATION: Hungary. METHODS: Using relev\u00E9 data from 60 cereal and 70 stubble fields, together with weed trait data, we characterized community responses to arable intensification using functional trait analyses based on trait\u2010convergence and trait\u2010divergence assembly patterns. We also examined how well the broad\u2010scale rarity status of species predicts their occurrence along intensification gradients, and how it maps onto our functional classifications describing intensification responses. RESULTS: The response of weeds to intensification in cereal fields was best described by a functional classification based on species\u0027 flowering duration, maximum height and seed weight: weeds of extensively managed fields have short flowering seasons (2\u20135 mo) and particularly large or small seeds. The highest proportions of rare species also happen to be found in these groups. The rarest weeds among these species tend to be late\u2010winter and early\u2010summer annuals, while the rare species of stubble fields tend to be broad\u2010leaved with low nitrogen requirements, small seeds and short height. Stubble fields showed a decline in weed cover with increasing application of fertilizer and distance from the field edge, but we could detect no strong associations of management factors with trait composition, perhaps because the intensification gradient across these fields was shorter. CONCLUSIONS: Many rare Hungarian weeds are associated with traditional extensive farming practices. They are particularly characterized by short, midsummer flowering periods and by preference for low nitrogen levels, but a range of trait syndromes must be considered to understand their ecology and conservation. Analyses based on trait\u2010divergence patterns, rather than trait\u2010convergence patterns, provide better insights into the functional composition of weed communities, emphasizing the importance of disruptive filters in weed community assembly and the need for improved methods to detect such effects.","publish_time":"2014-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinke, Gyula; Gunton, Richard M.","journal":"J Veg Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/260f32113c3aade6a9ffffce8bdbb3e1fcee16d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166743.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166743/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hungary"],"keyphrases":["weed trait data","trait composition","functional trait analyses","rare species of stubble fields","managed fields","cereal fields","functional composition of weed communities","weed cover","rarity of individual weed species","arable intensification","intensification responses","intensification gradients","weed community assembly","functional traits","range of trait syndromes","value of arable weed communities","functional classifications","rare Hungarian weeds","convergence patterns","response of weeds","short height","scale rarity status of species","rarest weeds","divergence patterns","highest proportions of rare species","short flowering seasons","divergence assembly patterns","community responses","small seeds","conservation","species\u0027 flowering duration","low nitrogen requirements","low nitrogen levels","midsummer flowering periods","maximum height","relev\u00E9 data","improved methods","seed weight","increasing application of fertilizer","preference","decline","better insights","importance of disruptive filters","distance","need","occurrence","strong associations of management factors","traditional extensive farming practices","summer annuals","winter","mo","field edge","CONCLUSIONS","effects","RESULTS","LOCATION","Hungary","QUESTION","ecology","groups"],"language":"en"},

A pathological and immunological comparison","doi":"10.1002/jemt.1070320305","pmcid":"PMC7166956","pubmed_id":"8527856","license":"no-cc","abstract":"Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) are considered among the best models of human multiple sclerosis (MS). In both models, clinical disease is characterized by paralysis, while pathological changes consist of inflammatory demyelination. In both models there is a genetic influence on susceptibility/resistance to the development of disease. This has been thoroughly studied in TMEV infection, and it has been found to depend on both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non\u2010MHC genes. At least four genes have been so far identified. Because of this genetic influence, some strains of mice are more susceptible to both clinical and pathological changes than others, and susceptibility appears to best correlate with the ability of a certain murine strain to develop a delayed\u2010type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to viral antigens. We have also observed that even among mice which are equally susceptible clinically, striking differences may be seen under pathological examination. These consist of different gradients of severity of inflammation, particularly in regards to the macrophage component. There is an inverse relationship between the number of macrophages, and their length of stay in the CNS, and the ability of mice to remyelinate their lesions. The most severe lesions are in SJL/J mice, and remyelination in this strain is extremely poor. The least severe lesions in terms of macrophage invasion are in strains such as NZW and RIIIS/J, and these are able to remyelinate lesions very successfully. Murine chronic relapsing EAE (CR\u2010EAE) shows pathological changes in many ways similar to those in TMEV\u2010infected SJL/J mice, although less severe in terms of degrees of macrophage infiltration and tissue destruction. Mice with CR\u2010EAE have a correspondingly limited ability to remyelinate their lesions. In both models the pathology appears to be mediated through a DTH response. However, while in EAE the DTH response is clearly against neuroantigens, the response in TMEV infection is against the virus itself. The end result in both models would be that of myelin destruction through a lymphotoxincytokine\u2010mediated mechanism. The importance of the DTH response in both models is well illustrated by the effects of tolerance induction in EAE and TMEV infection to neuroantigens and virus, respectively. These are important models of human MS, since the current hypothesis is that a viral infection early in life, on the appropriate genetic background, may trigger a secondary misdirected immune response which could be directed either against myelin antigens and/or possible persistent virus(es). \u00A9 1995 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.","publish_time":"2005-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dal Canto, Mauro C.; Melvold, Roger W.; Kim, Byung S.; Miller, Stephen D.","journal":"Microsc Res Tech","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83e91a3c775bc091c5e28af706455d78ecee1cb5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166956/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Theiler"],"organizations":["NZW","EAE","DTH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TMEV infection","DTH response","J mice","ability of mice","strains of mice","severe lesions","pathological changes","viral infection","important models of human MS","Murine chronic relapsing EAE","best models of human multiple sclerosis","Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus","pathological examination","genetic influence","secondary misdirected immune response","terms of macrophage invasion","macrophage infiltration","certain murine strain","myelin destruction","possible persistent virus","susceptibility","macrophage component","viral antigens","limited ability","myelin antigens","clinical disease","appropriate genetic background","non\u2010MHC genes","terms of degrees","infected SJL","tissue destruction","best correlate","development of disease","mediated mechanism","experimental allergic encephalomyelitis","resistance","life","current hypothesis","type hypersensitivity","remyelination","effects of tolerance induction","ways similar","number of macrophages","inflammation","major histocompatibility complex","regards","NZW","lymphotoxincytokine","paralysis","striking differences","different gradients of severity","inverse relationship","length","RIIIS","inflammatory demyelination","CNS","end result","importance","Wiley","Liss","pathology"],"language":"en"},

It is an enveloped, single\u2010stranded, plus\u2010sense RNA virus with a genome of \u223C30 kb. The structural proteins E, M and N of SARS\u2010CoV play important roles during host cell entry and viral morphogenesis and release. Therefore, we have studied whether expression of these structural proteins can be down\u2010regulated using an antisense technique. METHODS: Vero E6 cells were transfected with plasmid constructs containing exons of the SARS\u2010CoV structural protein E, M or N genes or their exons in frame with the reporter protein EGFP. The transfected cell cultures were treated with antisense phosphorothioated oligonucleotides (antisense PS\u2010ODN, 20mer) or a control oligonucleotide by addition to the culture medium. RESULTS: Among a total of 26 antisense PS\u2010ODNs targeting E, M and N genes, we obtained six antisense PS\u2010ODNs which could sequence\u2010specifically reduce target genes expression by over 90% at the concentration of 50 \u00B5M in the cell culture medium tested by RT\u2010PCR. The antisense effect was further proved by down\u2010regulating the expression of the fusion proteins containing the structural proteins E, M or N in frame with the reporter protein EGFP. In Vero E6 cells, the antisense effect was dependent on the concentrations of the antisense PS\u2010ODNs in a range of 0\u201310 \u00B5M or 0\u201330 \u00B5M. CONCLUSIONS: The antisense PS\u2010ODNs are effective in downregulation of SARS. The findings indicate that antisense knockdown of SARS could be a useful strategy for treatment of SARS, and could also be suitable for studies of the pathological function of SARS genes in a cellular model system.

Antigen grown in suckling mouse brain was used in all tests. Results obtained by the CF and HIG tests, and the RIA, were in good agreement with regard to the presence or absence of antibodies. Similar results were also obtained with the HI test if nonspecific haemagglutination inhibitors were first removed by treatment with phospholipase C and only titers of 1:20 or greater were considered positive. Children 6\u201323 months of age (n = 45) were without measurable coronavirus antibodies in all four assays. A rapid increase in the prevalence of antibodies then occurred in subsequent age groups, and practically all persons 6 years of age or older were found to have OC43 antibodies as measured by the HIG test or the RIA. The mean antibody levels determined by these two methods continued to increase, however, up to the age group of 10\u201314 years. This increase in antibody levels after the initial antibody incidence plateau may be due to boosting effects caused by related coronavirus strains, since OC43 antigens are known to cross\u2010react with antibodies induced by other human coronaviruses. Taken together, these data suggest that OC43 virus, or an antigenically related coronavirus strain, is very common in Finland.","publish_time":"2005-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hovi, Tapani; Kainulainen, Helena; Ziola, Barry; Salmi, Aimo","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b46412d2003ac6a4717a2fe401592b5aafaf3a3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF","RIA","HIG"],"locations":["Finland"],"keyphrases":["OC43 antibodies","measurable coronavirus antibodies","prevalence of antibodies","Serum antibodies","absence of antibodies","years of age","human coronavirus OC43","months of age","RIA","different age groups","subsequent age groups","OC43 antigens","OC43 virus","HIG tests","related coronavirus strains","HI test","mean antibody levels","CF","methods","rapid increase","haemagglutination inhibition","initial antibody incidence plateau","human coronaviruses","Similar results","nonspecific haemagglutination inhibitors","radial diffusion haemolysis","treatment","gel","presence","fixation","persons","phase radioimmunoassay","titers","regard","good agreement","effects","suckling mouse brain","phospholipase C","assays","Finland","data","Children"],"language":"en"},

Most frequently it has been linked with the Guineo\u2010Congolian rain forest block. The present paper aims to test six alternative hypotheses of the zoogeographical relationships between this forest remnant and other African forests using reptiles as a model group. Reptiles are relatively slow dispersers, compared with flying organisms (Aves and Odonata) on which former hypotheses have been based, and may thus result in a more conservative biogeographical analysis. Location Kakamega Forest, Kenya, Sub\u2010Saharan Africa. Methods The reptile diversity of Kakamega Forest was evaluated by field surveys and data from literature resources. Faunal comparisons of Kakamega Forest with 16 other African forests were conducted by the use of the \u2018coefficient of biogeographic resemblance\u2019 using the reptile communities as zoogeographic indicators. Parsimony Analysis of Endemism and Neighbour Joining Analysis of Endemism were used to generate relationship trees based on an occurrence matrix with paup*. Results The analysis clearly supports the hypothesis that the Kakamega Forest is the easternmost fragment of the Guineo\u2010Congolian rain forest belt, and thus more closely related to the forests of that Central\u2013West African complex than to any forest further east, such as the Kenyan coastal forests. Many Kenyan reptile species occur exclusively in the Kakamega Forest and its associated forest fragments. Main conclusions The Kakamega Forest is the only remnant of the Guineo\u2010Congolian rain forest in the general area. We assume that the low degree of resemblance identified for the Guineo\u2010Congolian forest and the East African coastal forest reflect the long history of isolation of the two forest types from each other. Kenyan coastal forests may have been historically connected through forest \u2018bridges\u2019 of the southern highlands with the Congo forest belt, allowing reptile species to migrate between them. The probability of a second \u2018bridge\u2019 located in the region of southern Tanzanian inselbergs is discussed. Although not particularly rich in reptile species, the area should be considered of high national priority for conservation measures.","publish_time":"2008-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wagner, Philipp; K\u00F6hler, J\u00F6rn; Schmitz, Andreas; B\u00F6hme, Wolfgang","journal":"J Biogeogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c01e8fa26c8dc327c5908ad081bfc7e4aa92e38d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167171.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167171/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Location Kakamega Forest"],"locations":["Africa","Kenya","Congo"],"keyphrases":["Congolian forest","forest remnant","forest types","Location Kakamega Forest","reptile diversity of Kakamega Forest","Congo forest belt","Congolian rain forest belt","East African coastal forest","associated forest fragments","Faunal comparisons of Kakamega Forest","montane forest biomes","Congolian rain forest block","African forests","Guineo","Kenyan reptile species","Kenyan coastal forests","reptile communities","Parsimony Analysis of Endemism","West African complex","Neighbour Joining Analysis of Endemism","reptiles","conservative biogeographical analysis","southern highlands","general area","western Kenya","alternative hypotheses","coefficient of biogeographic resemblance","low degree of resemblance","region of southern Tanzanian inselbergs","field surveys","long history of isolation","easternmost fragment","flying organisms","zoogeographical relationships","Sub\u2010Saharan Africa","high national priority","occurrence matrix","conservation measures","data","literature resources","Odonata","slow dispersers","relationship trees","use","Methods","model group","Aves","zoogeographic indicators","bridges\u2019","Main conclusions","hypothesis","present paper","paup","probability"],"language":"en"},

Diagnostic tools require rapid and accurate methods, of which a capture ELISA method may be useful. Toward this goal, we have prepared and characterized soluble full\u2010length nucleocapsid proteins (N protein) from SARS and 229E human coronaviruses. N proteins form oligomers, mostly as dimers at low concentration. These two N proteins degrade rapidly upon storage and the major degraded N protein is the C\u2010terminal fragment of amino acid (aa) 169\u2013422. Taken together with other data, we suggest that N protein is a two\u2010domain protein, with the N\u2010terminal aa 50\u2013150 as the RNA\u2010binding domain and the C\u2010terminal aa 169\u2013422 as the dimerization domain. Polyclonal antibodies against the SARS N protein have been produced and the strong binding sites of the anti\u2010nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibodies produced were mapped to aa 1\u201320, aa 150\u2013170 and aa 390\u2013410. These sites are generally consistent with those mapped by sera obtained from SARS patients. The SARS anti\u2010NP antibody was able to clearly detect SARS virus grown in Vero E6 cells and did not cross\u2010react with the NP from the human coronavirus 229E. We have predicted several antigenic sites (15\u201320 amino acids) of S, M and N proteins and produced antibodies against those peptides, some of which could be recognized by sera obtained from SARS patients. Antibodies against the NP peptides could detect the cognate N protein clearly. Further refinement of these antibodies, particularly large\u2010scale production of monoclonal antibodies, could lead to the development of useful diagnostic kits for diseases associated with SARS and other human coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2005-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Tswen\u2010Kei; Wu, Mark P.\u2010J.; Chen, Shui\u2010Tsung; Hou, Ming\u2010Hon; Hong, Ming\u2010Hsiang; Pan, Fu\u2010Ming; Yu, Hui\u2010Ming; Chen, Jenn\u2010Han; Yao, Chen\u2010Wen; Wang, Andrew H.\u2010J.","journal":"Proteomics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167620/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SARS N","NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS N protein","cognate N protein","domain protein","SARS patients","SARS virus","major degraded N protein","produced antibodies","SARS anti\u2010NP antibody","N proteins form oligomers","anti\u2010nucleocapsid protein","Polyclonal antibodies","NP peptides","binding domain","large\u2010scale production of monoclonal antibodies","soluble full\u2010length nucleocapsid proteins","strong binding sites","dimerization domain","antigenic sites","E human coronaviruses","sera","terminal fragment of amino acid","Diagnostic tools","development of useful diagnostic kits","amino acids","early diagnosis","infection control","diseases","storage","serious health threat","accurate methods","potential treatment","dimers","Vero E6 cells","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","capture ELISA method","RNA","low concentration","refinement","data","goal"],"language":"en"},

The PDDA surface was constructed by electrostatic adsorption of the polyelectrolyte onto a monolayer of 11\u2010mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA). Poly\u2010l\u2010lysine was also adsorbed onto the MUA monolayer and compared with the PDDA surface in the capacity of mumps virus immobilization. The PDDA surface showed a higher adsorption of mumps virus than the poly\u2010l\u2010lysine surface. The SPR signal caused by the virus binding onto the PDDA surface was proportional to the concentration of mumps virus from 0.5 \u00D7 10(5) to 14 \u00D7 10(5) pfu/mL. The surface structure of the virus arrays was visualized by atomic force microscopy. Then, a dose\u2010dependent increase in the SPR signal was observed when various concentrations of the antimumps virus antibody in buffer or human serum were applied to the virus arrays, and their interaction was specific.

The use of random geometric graphs (RGGs) is one of such network models that allows for the consideration of spatial properties on disease propagation. In certain real-world scenarios\u2014like in the analysis of a disease propagating through plants\u2014the shape of the plots and fields where the host of the disease is located may play a fundamental role in the propagation dynamics. Here we consider a generalization of the RGG to account for the variation of the shape of the plots or fields where the hosts of a disease are allocated. We consider a disease propagation taking place on the nodes of a random rectangular graph and we consider a lower bound for the epidemic threshold of a susceptible-infected-susceptible model or a susceptible-infected-recovered model on these networks. Using extensive numerical simulations and based on our analytical results we conclude that (ceteris paribus) the elongation of the plot or field in which the nodes are distributed makes the network more resilient to the propagation of a disease due to the fact that the epidemic threshold increases with the elongation of the rectangle. These results agree with accumulated empirical evidence and simulation results about the propagation of diseases on plants in plots or fields of the same area and different shapes.","publish_time":"2016-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Estrada, Ernesto; Meloni, Sandro; Sheerin, Matthew; Moreno, Yamir","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/539a38db27a297c3c20edafd7c7788cfd0987ecf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217508.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model disease propagation","disease propagating","propagation of diseases","propagation dynamics","susceptible model","plots","fields","susceptible-infected","network models","simulation results","nodes","plants","analytical results","use of network theory","epidemic threshold","elongation","use of random geometric graphs","random rectangular graph","classical epidemiological models","populations","important elements of reality","accumulated empirical evidence","analysis","RGGs","consideration of spatial properties","account","ceteris paribus","variation","area","place","fundamental role","extensive numerical simulations","fact","hosts","certain real-world scenarios","different shapes","generalization","networks","rectangle"],"language":"en"},

A simple and ideal quarantine measure is considered in which an individual is detected with a probability immediately after it becomes infected and the detected one and its neighbors are promptly isolated. The efficiency of this quarantine in suppressing a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is tested in random graphs and uncorrelated scale-free networks. Monte Carlo simulations are used to show that the prompt quarantine measure outperforms random and acquaintance preventive vaccination schemes in terms of reducing the number of infected individuals. The epidemic threshold for the SIR model is analytically derived under the quarantine measure, and the theoretical findings indicate that prompt executions of quarantines are highly effective in containing epidemics. Even if infected individuals are detected with a very low probability, the SIR model under a prompt quarantine measure has finite epidemic thresholds in fat-tailed scale-free networks in which an infected individual can always cause an outbreak of a finite relative size without any measure. The numerical simulations also demonstrate that the present quarantine measure is effective in suppressing epidemics in real networks.","publish_time":"2017-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hasegawa, Takehisa; Nemoto, Koji","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2e974468723866cba9f8ac47b5cb765fda4cea9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217515.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217515/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prompt quarantine measure","present quarantine measure","ideal quarantine measure","SIR model","epidemics","susceptible-infected","number of infected individuals","real networks","uncorrelated scale-free networks","fat-tailed scale-free networks","prompt executions of quarantines","finite epidemic thresholds","random graphs","low probability","numerical simulations","finite relative size","Monte Carlo simulations","acquaintance preventive vaccination schemes","terms","theoretical findings","outbreak","manner","neighbors","study","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

For several directly transmitted diseases, reinfection is a relevant process, which can be expressed by endogenous reactivation of the pathogen or by exogenous reinfection due to direct contact with an infected individual (with smaller reinfection rate [Formula: see text] than infection rate [Formula: see text]). In this paper, we examine the stochastic susceptible, infected, recovered, infected (SIRI) model simulating the endogenous reactivation by a spontaneous reaction, while exogenous reinfection by a catalytic reaction. Analyzing the mean-field approximations of a site and pairs of sites, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the particular case of exogenous reinfection, we obtained continuous phase transitions involving endemic, epidemic, and no transmission phases for the simple approach; the approach of pairs is better to describe the phase transition from endemic phase (susceptible, infected, susceptible (SIS)-like model) to epidemic phase (susceptible, infected, and removed or recovered (SIR)-like model) considering the comparison with MC results; the reinfection increases the peaks of outbreaks until the system reaches endemic phase. For the particular case of endogenous reactivation, the approach of pairs leads to a continuous phase transition from endemic phase (SIS-like model) to no transmission phase. Finally, there is no phase transition when both effects are taken into account. We hope the results of this study can be generalized for the susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed or recovered ([Formula: see text]) model, for which the state exposed (infected but not infectious), describing more realistically transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis. In future work, we also intend to investigate the effect of network topology on phase transitions when the SIRI model describes both transmitted diseases ([Formula: see text]) and social contagions ([Formula: see text]).","publish_time":"2017-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barros, Alessandro S.; Pinho, Suani T.

The study of bNAbs arising in natural infection is essential in this endeavor. We generated a human antibody, 8D6, recognizing the E2 protein of HCV isolated from a chronic hepatitis C patient. This antibody shows broadly neutralizing activity, which covers a pan-genotypic panel of cell culture-derived HCV virions (HCVcc). Functional and epitope analyses demonstrated that 8D6 can block the interaction between E2 and CD81 by targeting a highly conserved epitope on E2. We describe how the 8D6 lineage evolved via somatic hypermutation to achieve broad neutralization. We found that the V(D)J recombination-generated junctional and somatic hypermutation-induced disulfide bridge (C-C) motif in the CDRH3 is critical for the broad neutralization and binding activity of 8D6. This motif is conserved among a series of broadly neutralizing HCV antibodies, indicating a common binding model. Next, the 8D6 inferred germline (iGL) was reconstructed and tested for its binding affinity and neutralization activity. Interestingly, 8D6 iGL-mediated relatively strong inhibition of the 1b genotype PR79L9 strain, suggesting that PR79L9 may serve as a potential natural viral strain that provides E2 sequences that induce bNAbs. Overall, our detailed epitope mapping and genetic studies of the HCV E2-specific mAb 8D6 have allowed for further refinement of antigenic sites on E2 and reveal a new mechanism to generate a functional CDRH3, while its iGL can serve as a probe to identify potential HCV vaccine strains.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yi, Chunyan; Xia, Jing; He, Lan; Ling, Zhiyang; Wang, Xuesong; Yan, Yu; Wang, Jiangjun; Zhao, Xinhao; Fan, Weiguo; Sun, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Ronghua; Ye, Sheng; Zhang, Rongguang; Xu, Yongfen; Ma, Liyan; Zhang, Yaguang; Zhou, Honglin; Huang, Zhong; Niu, Junqi; Long, Gang; Lu, Junxia; Zhong, Jin; Sun, Bing","journal":"Cell Mol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d88f5e74983640e30e8b5818cc0e2e2a9d3fb692.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222171.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222171/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["8D6 iGL","E2 protein of HCV","binding activity of 8D6","HCV E2-specific mAb 8D6","C-C","8D6 lineage","neutralizing HCV antibodies","E2 sequences","neutralization activity","neutralizing activity","potential HCV vaccine strains","broad neutralization","conserved epitope","chronic hepatitis C patient","potential natural viral strain","functional CDRH3","binding affinity","epitope analyses","study of bNAbs","motif","major goal of hepatitis C virus","common binding model","detailed epitope mapping","pan-genotypic panel of cell culture-derived HCV virions","natural infection","b genotype PR79L9 strain","vaccine research","monoclonal antibodies","human antibody","somatic hypermutation-induced disulfide bridge","viral envelope glycoproteins","genetic studies","J recombination","strong inhibition","probe","new mechanism","HCVcc","refinement of antigenic sites","CD81","series","endeavor","interaction","Induction","germline"],"language":"en"},

During the last 10-15 years, numerous aptamers have been developed specifically against targets present on or associated with the surface of human cells or infectious pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites. Several of the aptamers have been described as potent probes, rivalling antibodies, for use in flow cytometry or microscopy. Some have also been used as drugs by inhibiting or activating functions of their targets in a manner similar to neutralizing or agonistic antibodies. Additionally, it is straightforward to conjugate aptamers to other agents without losing their affinity and they have successfully been used in vitro and in vivo to deliver drugs, siRNA, nanoparticles or contrast agents to target cells. Hence, aptamers identified against cell surface biomarkers represent a promising class of ligands.

We present a six-month strategy to empower patients\u2019 caregivers on HCW HH compliance. METHODS: HH compliance in HCWs was evaluated between June 1 and August 31, 2017 as recommended by WHO. Between September 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017 we undertook the empowering in the hematology-oncology ward (50 beds) from Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, a cancer referral, teaching hospital in Mexico. To empower patients and their caregivers, a member of the team visited the patient and their relatives during the first 24h of hospital admission. Standarized information on HH and the importance of HCW compliance was given, along with a printed cartoon on HH opportunities (5 moments from WHO). Patients and their caregivers were trained to observe and record HH opportunties, an were invited to remind HCWs if HH omissions were observed. Data on HH compliance was collected monthly during the empowerment and 1 month after. Data was compared with the HH compliance from the 6 previous. We compared overall compliance and for each 5 HH moments before and after the empowering (chi (2) test). RESULTS: We empowered 82 caregivers (M: 25.6%) and F: 74.4%), mean age 44 years. 24.4% had completed primary education, and 13.1% had higher education. Mothers and spouses were the primary caregivers (28.1% and 36.6%). HH compliance increased in all 5 moments: Before touching a patient (M1) (B: 9.5%, A: 57.6%, P = 0.005); before a clean or aseptic procedure (M2) (B: 7.9%, A: 48%, P = 0.002); after body fluid exposure (M3) (B: 10%, A: 59%, P = 0.0005), after touching a patient (M4) (B: 7.4%, A: 57.9%, P = 0.0005), and after touching patient surroundings (M5) (B: 2.4%, A: 77.4%, P = 0.0008). Nurses achieved a higher increase on compliance compared with physicians. Caregivers recognition on HH increased for each opporunity, being more notorious for M2 (B:31.7%, A: 61.5%); M3 (B: 7.3%, A: 31.5%), and M4, (B: 36.5%, A: 68.7%). Perception on the importance of preventing health-care-related infections increased from 80.5% to 90.3%. CONCLUSION: Empowering patients\u2019 primary caregivers was an effective intervention to increase HCWs HH compliance at a hematology-oncology ward. The effect of this intervention remains to be evaluated on the long-term basis, but demonstrate the importance of involving patients and their relatives on health-care delivery.

Here, we describe CoV infections and clinical characteristics among adults (\u003E18 years) presenting with respiratory illness in Cleveland, Ohio. METHODS: Between February 1, 2016 and April 30, 2017, 2949 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed by NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel in adults presenting with respiratory illness at MetroHealth Medical Center. Clinical data were collected on adults whose samples screened positive for CoV-HKU1, CoV-OC43, CoV-229E or CoV-NL63. RESULTS: Coronaviruses were detected in 192 (6.5%) adults including 105 (3.5%) OC43, 67 (2.3%) 229E, 13 (0.4%) HKU1 and 7 (0.2%) NL63. The majority of adults with coronavirus infection were females (66.2%) with a median age of 53 years. Common comorbidities included smoking (40.0%), asthma (38.0%), COPD (35.4%), and inhaled corticosteroid use (28.6%). Eighty-five (46.4%) required admission to the hospital. Common presenting symptoms included shortness of breath (42.7%) and cough (31.0%) whereas fever was uncommon (12.5%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in HKU1 and NL63 infected adults. Seventy-three percent of coronavirus disease occurred between the months of January and March. Despite the recognition of coronavirus infection, 70 (36.5%) received antibiotics for their disease. CONCLUSION: This study provides needed insight into clinical characteristics and severity associated with coronavirus infection in adults. Coronavirus infection should be considered in differential diagnosis of respiratory tract illness in adults including those that require hospitalization, have a history of smoking and have pulmonary comorbidities.

The Role of Non-Influenza Viruses in the Seasonal Viral Respiratory Illness: A Epidemiologic Study From October 2016\u2013March 2017","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofy210.2170","pmcid":"PMC6253674","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Influenza virus (IV) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; however, understanding the contribution of non-influenza viruses (NIV) to the annual burden of respiratory illnesses (RI) is evolving. Improvements in diagnostic techniques, including the increasing clinical use of respiratory viral PCR panels (vPCR), have markedly advanced our understanding of the contributions of NIV to the \u201Cinfluenza season.\u201D METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all vPCR results from one hospital system, collected between October 1, 2016 and March 7, 2017, including inpatient and outpatient samples was performed. 2,047 vPCR tests were reviewed; after removing those with undetermined results and internal control samples, 1,924 were analyzed. Data points abstracted included detection and identification of virus, and date of detection. We compared the total and monthly rates of NIV with IV, throughout the study period. RESULTS: Of 1,924 vPCR results, 985 (51%) were positive for a respiratory virus. Of these, 302 (31%) were IV, and 683 (69%) were NIV. For every month studied, the ratio of NIV to IV exceeded 50%, including the height of the season. The most commonly detected viruses were Influenza A (30%), Rhino/Enterovirus (24%), RSV (19%), Coronavirus OC43 (7%) and Metapneumovirus (5%). The peak influenza incidence temporally coincided with the national peak months of January and February. The NIV incidence paralleled the trend in IV incidence, dominated by Rhino/Enterovirus and RSV, but without a specific virus driving the trend. CONCLUSION: Non-influenza respiratory viruses cause substantial viral RI during the winter months. Many viral syndromes during the height of influenza season have traditionally been attributed to IV, including influenza-like-illness (ILI); however, these can now be better characterized using patient-specific vPCR panels, leading to improved understanding of NIV epidemiology. Even during the period of highest IV incidence, NIV infections were more common than IV. Understanding the high prevalence of NIV infections may improve the judicious use of both antibiotics and antivirals. There may also be a role for refinement of ILI, including best practices for diagnosis and treatment.

METHODS: We conducted active, prospective surveillance for ARIs (defined as \u22652 new signs/symptoms of respiratory illness) among all residents in three PCCFs near New York City from December 7, 2016 to May 7, 2017. The parents/guardians of some residents also provided consent for research specimen collection at the start of the study. In that subset, nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained \u22644 days of ARI symptom onset and weekly for 4 weeks of follow-up to assess viral shedding. Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1), parainfluenzavirus (PIV 1\u20134), metapneumovirus (MPV), adenovirus (AdV), bocavirus (BoV), enterovirus, parechovirus, and M. pneumoniae were tested by the Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 real-time RT-PCR panel. RESULTS: Subset with research specimen collection: Among 79 residents (aged 0\u201320 years, median = 8), 60 ARIs were reported in 37 (47%) residents. Swabs were obtained at illness onset for 53/60 ARI episodes; among these, there were 25 single-virus detections and five co-detections. An additional 33 single- and five co-detections occurred in 175 follow-up swabs (table). Molecular typing of 32 RV\u002B specimens identified 13 RV types. All residents: During the 2016\u20132017 influenza season, 308/322 (96%) age-eligible residents received influenza vaccine and 168/364 (46%) received prophylactic antivirals for influenza exposures. Although influenza was not detected in research swabs, it was detected in 3/200 tests conducted for clinical purposes. CONCLUSION: ARIs were common among residents of three PCCFs, and a variety of respiratory viruses were detected. The rarity of influenza may reflect strong infection control practices in these facilities, including vaccination and prophylactic use of antivirals.

Such a \u2018fast-forward\u2019 evolution enables viruses to rapidly adapt to new host species, evade host immune responses, and to develop resistance to anti-viral drugs. Similarly, rapid evolution allows viruses to attain new levels of virulence, defined as the ability to cause severe disease in hosts. We hypothesize that distinct viral groups share genetic determinants that modulate virulence that have been acquired through convergent evolution. Thus, common patterns reflecting changing virulence-related specific viral groups could be detected. The main goals for this project are (1) to understand how genetic and phenotypic diversity can be generated among different viral groups by analyzing the variation patterns and determining the selective forces behind them (impact in viral fitness) and (2) to understand how fixed mutations can modulate virulence within different viral groups by performing comparison of strains with differing virulence within a longitudinal timescale. The subject of the study is key emerging and re-emerging virus families of medical importance. Such groups include: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses), Picornaviridae (Hepatitis A virus), Flaviviridae (Yellow fever, West Nile, Hepatitis C, Dengue, and Zika viruses), Togaviridae (Rubella and Chikungunya virus), Bornaviridae (Borna-disease virus), Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses), Paramyxoviridae (Measles, Nipah, and Hendra viruses), Rhabdoviridae (Lyssaviruses), Arenaviridae (Lassa virus), Bunyaviridae (Hanta- and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses), and Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza A viruses). Viral genomes collected at different time points, different hosts (human and their most closely related animal reservoirs) and different locations will be compiled. Extensive molecular evolutionary analyses will be carried out to infer gene expansion/contraction within groups, rates of evolution, and changes in selection pressure, including the detection of positive selected genes and sites (adaptive evolution). Positively selected sites will be mapped onto the viral protein structures to reveal their impact on function, and hence the location of potential virulence determinants. Virulence changes among particular viral strains and types will be defined and measured according to definitions based on an increase in: (1) transmissibility, (2) host tropism, (3) immune evasion, (4) morbidity and mortality, (5) drug resistance, and by the incorporation of epidemiological data to determine whether high or low virulence strains within different hosts and localities are spreading most efficiently in nature.","publish_time":"2019-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Escalera-Zamudio, Marina; Guti\u00E9rrez, Bernardo; Th\u00E9z\u00E9, Julien; Pybus, Oliver G","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6735695/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["different viral groups","distinct viral groups","Virulence changes","Viral genomes","viral fitness","Zika viruses","different hosts","Hendra viruses","Marburg viruses","RNA viruses","differing virulence","changing virulence-related specific viral groups","particular viral strains","low virulence strains","rates of evolution","phenotypic evolution","rapid evolution","new levels of virulence","viral protein structures","anti-viral drugs","different locations","adaptive evolution","convergent evolution","Lassa virus","Chikungunya virus","location of potential virulence determinants","different time points","Borna-disease virus","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses","comparison of strains","host immune responses","new host species","severe disease","host tropism","impact","selected sites","genetic determinants","re-emerging virus families of medical importance","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Hepatitis C","Yellow fever","variation patterns","common patterns","combination of high rates of mutation","immune evasion","phenotypic diversity","drug resistance","Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses","related animal reservoirs","detection of positive selected genes","West Nile","Hanta","Dengue","Flaviviridae","Lyssaviruses","Rubella","human","Measles","Bornaviridae","Ebola","Filoviridae","Arenaviridae","study","Bunyaviridae","Paramyxoviridae","Picornaviridae","Togaviridae","Coronaviridae","contraction","Orthomyxoviridae","localities","selection pressure","selective forces","replication","Rhabdoviridae","Nipah","types","ability","incorporation of epidemiological data","gene expansion","longitudinal timescale","fixed mutations","Extensive molecular evolutionary analyses","subject","mortality","morbidity","function","transmissibility","Influenza","main goals","project","increase","fast-forward","definitions","nature"],"language":"en"},

Human CoVs cause mild respiratory diseases worldwide, but, in the last decade, two Beta-CoVs [Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome] caused thousands of deaths and cases worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the evolutionary origin of mammalian CoVs is derived from bats. In this study, we characterized three Alpha-CoVs and two Beta-CoVs demonstrating the circulation of bat strains in Italy. Isolates were sequenced using a next-generation sequencing approach and genomes reconstructed using the online tool Galaxy Aries. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA7 and MrBayes. Similarity plots were generated using SSE v1.2. The structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S protein was predicted by sequence-homology method using the protein data bank. Bioinformatics analysis permitted the identification of 2 Beta-CoV complete genomes of 30 kb and three Alpha-CoV of 28 kb (named BatCoV-ITA1-5). BatCoV-ITA1 and 2 formed a monophyletic group with MERS-CoV sequences. The comparison of the concatenated domains within ORF1ab confirmed their classification into the MERS-CoV species. The 3D structure of RBD of Italian strains showed two amino acid deletions located in a region corresponding to the external subdomain of MERS-RBD. BatCoV-Ita3 and BatCoV-Ita4/5 were classified into two novel Alpha-CoV species by comparison of concatenated domains within ORF1ab. Due to the high divergence with the Alpha human spike protein strains, it was impossible to establish the protein structure and the potential affinity to human receptor. The Italian strains showed the typical organization of Alpha and Beta-CoVs. We reported two Beta-CoVs closely related to MERS-CoVs from bats belonging to common Italian species (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Hypsugo savii). The analysis of the RBD in the spike protein indicates significant differences from human RBD known to date. The three Alpha-CoV strains were classified into two novel species, confirming the high heterogeneity of CoV strains in bats. Although the studies conducted cannot confirm a risk for humans, surveillance studies are needed to investigate the genetic diversity of CoVs in bats. Because this exceeds what is known for other hosts, it is compatible with bats being the major reservoir of mammalian CoVs.","publish_time":"2019-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Sabato, L; Vaccari, G; Lelli, D; Lavazza, A; Castrucci, M R; Moreno, A","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6735706/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs4Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Galaxy Aries","SSE v1."],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Alpha-CoVs","MERS-CoVs","Beta-CoVs","Alpha-CoV strains","Bats","MERS-CoV species","novel Alpha-CoV species","MERS-CoV sequences","Alpha human spike protein strains","Italian strains","human RBD","genetic diversity of CoVs","high heterogeneity of CoV strains","protein structure","Beta-CoV complete genomes","major reservoir of mammalian CoVs","evolutionary origin of mammalian CoVs","Human CoVs cause mild respiratory diseases","S protein","novel species","human receptor","D structure of RBD","BatCoV-ITA1","common Italian species","circulation of bat strains","typical organization of Alpha","Phylogenetic analysis","BatCoV-Ita3","BatCoV-Ita4","protein data bank","external subdomain of MERS","comparison of concatenated domains","ORF1ab","Bioinformatics analysis","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Middle East respiratory syndrome","high divergence","surveillance studies","Phylogenetic analyses","natural reservoir of Coronaviruses","receptor binding domain","Pipistrellus kuhlii","significant differences","classification","sequence-homology method","amino acid deletions","region","thousands of deaths","monophyletic group","identification","potential affinity","Hypsugo savii","online tool Galaxy Aries","risk","generation sequencing approach","Similarity plots","SSE v1","MEGA7","humans","Italy","date","MrBayes","cases","hosts","decade","study","Isolates"],"language":"en"},

Exhausted CD8(\u002B)T cells also called T suppressors are highly immune suppressive with altered T cell receptor signaling characteristics that mark it exclusively from their cytotoxic counterparts. Our study found that iCa(2\u002B) flux is reduced following T cell receptor activation in T suppressor cells when compared to their effector counterpart. Importantly chronic activation of murine cytotoxic CD8(\u002B) T cells lead to reduced iCa(2\u002B) influx, decreased IFN-\u03B3 and enhanced IL-10 production and this profile is mimicked in Tc1 cells upon reduction of iCa(2\u002B) flux by extracellular calcium channel inhibitors. Further reduced iCa(2\u002B) flux induced ROS which lead to IFN-\u03B3 reduction and increased IL-10 producing T suppressors through the STAT3\u2014STAT5 axis. The above findings were substantiated by our human data where reduced iCa(2\u002B) flux in chronic Hepatitis infections displayed CD8(\u002B) T cells with low IFN-\u03B3 and increased IL-10 production. Importantly treatment with an antioxidant led to increased IFN-\u03B3 and reduced IL-10 production in human chronic Hep-B/C samples suggesting overall a proximal regulatory role for iCa(2\u002B) influx, ROS, and IL-10 in determining the effector/ suppressive axis of CD8(\u002B) T cells.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohanty, Subhasmita; Barik, Prakash; Debata, Nagen; Nagarajan, Perumal; Devadas, Satish","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43958bbc3408dcadd9927642e1e754b607adc3f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7068714.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","T suppressor cells","reduced IL","reduced iCa","increased IL","producing T suppressors","increased IFN-\u03B3","production","Tc1 cells","reduction of iCa","altered T cell receptor","enhanced IL","Exhaustion of CD8","following T cell receptor activation","IFN-\u03B3 reduction","low IFN-\u03B3","decreased IFN-\u03B3","chronic activation of murine cytotoxic CD8","suppressive axis of CD8","Exhausted CD8","chronic viral infections","chronic Hepatitis infections","human chronic Hep-B","cytotoxic capabilities","influx","cytotoxic counterparts","ROS","human data","consequent exhaustion","STAT5 axis","effector counterpart","C samples","loss","mechanisms","STAT3","proximal regulatory role","extracellular calcium channel inhibitors","characteristics","antioxidant","profile","findings","treatment","study"],"language":"en"},

By using methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the range of targets that can now be reliably diagnosed has grown to the extent that there are now extremely few, known pathogens that cannot be identified accurately by using laboratory-based diagnostics. However, while the detection of pathogens in individual, infected samples is becoming simpler, there are still many scenarios that present a major challenge to diagnosticians and plant pathologists. Amongst these are the detection of pathogens in soil or viruses in their vectors, high throughput testing and the development of generic methods, that allow samples to be simultaneously screened for large numbers of pathogens. Another major challenge is to develop robust technologies that avoid the reliance on well-equipped central laboratories and making reliable diagnostics available to pathologists in the field or in less-developed countries. In recent years, much of the research carried out on phytodiagnostics has focussed in these areas and as a result many novel, routine diagnostic tests are becoming available. This has been possible due to the introduction of new molecular technologies such real-time PCR and microarrays. These advances have been complemented by the development of new nucleic acid extraction methods, increased automation, reliable internal controls, assay multiplexing and generic amplification methods. With developments in new hardware, field-portable real-time PCR is now also a reality and offers the prospect of ultra-rapid, on-site molecular diagnostics for the first time. In this paper, the development and implementation of new diagnostic methods based upon novel molecular techniques is presented, with specific examples given to demonstrate how these new methods can be used to overcome some long-standing problems.","publish_time":"2006-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mumford, Rick; Boonham, Neil; Tomlinson, Jenny; Barker, Ian","journal":"Eur J Plant Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4871a58e3e17bb8418f63887b31a931b7ce8908d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087944/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new methods","implementation of new diagnostic methods","development of generic methods","detection of pathogens","molecular diagnostics","development of new nucleic acid extraction methods","generic amplification methods","detection of plant pathogens","introduction of new molecular technologies","new hardware","novel molecular techniques","reliable diagnostics available","large numbers of pathogens","laboratory-based diagnostics","field-portable real-time PCR","major challenge","plant pathologists","developments","routine diagnostic tests","robust technologies","infected samples","reliable internal controls","increased automation","assay","well-equipped central laboratories","viruses","high throughput testing","significant improvements","vectors","reliance","result","individual","prospect of ultra-rapid","polymerase chain reaction","reality","soil","diagnosticians","microarrays","research","areas","scenarios","specific examples","decade","range of targets","recent years","phytodiagnostics","paper","long-standing problems","countries","advances","extent"],"language":"en"},

The authors introduce a method for simultaneous imaging, detection and quantitative evaluation of multiple viruses in single cells by using multicolor quantum dot (QD) probes and in a single staining cycle. The multicolor QD probes were fabricated via interaction between QDs conjugated to Staph. aureus protein A (SpA-QDs) and virus-specific antibodies. A cocktail of differently colored QD-SpA-MAbs probes were loaded into the same cells containing multiple viruses, and this enabled the different viruses to be fluorescently imaged and analyzed simultaneously. Specifically, influenza A viruses of type H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2, as well as human adenovirus species B type 3 (HAdV-B3) were imaged and detected in virus-infected cells or in their co-infected cells. In our perception, the method provides a flexible platform for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses in co-infected cells. Hence, it offers new opportunities for the molecular diagnosis of virus coinfection and for studies on virus-cell interactions.

Especially in children, chronic cough (\u003E4 weeks) is a significant burden on the child and family. While in the past, the lower airways were considered sterile, the concept of a physiologic microbiome of the lower respiratory tract has increasingly emerged. Of the differential diagnoses of chronic cough, protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is more common in otherwise (pulmonary) healthy children under 6 years of age. Tracheomalacia may primarily exist or be the result of mechanically straining coughing, whereas apart from a reduced alveolar phagocytosis, there is usually no systemic or local immune weakness. Instead, an activated innate immunity with increased gene expression of the interleukin-1\u03B2 signaling pathway can be immunologically detected. Here too, it is difficult to differentiate between cause and effect of chronic inflammatory events. Today, PBB and non-CF bronchiectasis, i.e., bronchiectasis not caused by cystic fibrosis (CF), are two sides of a disease spectrum of suppurative lung diseases, thus, making consequent therapy and long-term pediatric pneumological support of children with chronic productive cough necessary.","publish_time":"2018-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rose, M.

To estimate the relative contribution of particular viruses to the development of the immune system and allergic disease, we investigated longitudinally the prevalence of respiratory viral infections in infants. One hundred and twenty\u2010six healthy infants were included in this prospective birth cohort study in their first year of life. Physical examination was performed and nasal brush samples were taken during routine visits every 6 months and during an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (sick visits). The prevalence of respiratory viral infections in infants with URTI, infants with rhinitis without general malaise and infants without nasal symptoms was studied. Rhinovirus was the most prevalent pathogen during URTI and rhinitis in 0\u2010 to 2\u2010year\u2010old infants (\u223C40%). During URTI, also respiratory syncytial virus (\u223C20%) and coronavirus (\u223C10%) infections were found, which were rarely detected in infants with rhinitis. Surprisingly, in 20% of infants who did not present with nasal symptoms, rhinovirus infections were also detected. During routine visits at 12 months, a higher prevalence of rhinovirus infections was found in infants who attended day\u2010care compared with those who did not. We did not observe a relation between breast\u2010feeding or smoking by one or both parents and the prevalence of rhinovirus infections. The parental history of atopy was not related to the prevalence of rhinovirus infection, indicating that the genetic risk of allergic disease does not seem to increase the chance of rhinovirus infections. In conclusion, rhinovirus infection is the most prevalent respiratory viral infection in infants. It may therefore affect the maturation of the immune system and the development of allergic disease considerably.","publish_time":"2003-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Benten, Inesz; Koopman, Laurens; Niesters, Bert; Hop, Wim; Van Middelkoop, Barbara; De Waal, Leon; Van Drunen, Kees; Osterhaus, Albert; Neijens, Herman; Fokkens, Wytske","journal":"Pediatr Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a0d58458f2dc9cde184a3a4f0eee1e7e1c19755.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168036.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168036/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory infections","prevalence of respiratory viral infections","healthy infants","year\u2010old infants","chance of rhinovirus infections","higher prevalence of rhinovirus infections","URTI","prevalent respiratory viral infection","development of allergic disease","upper respiratory tract infection","rhinitis","respiratory syncytial virus","genetic risk of allergic disease","nasal symptoms","routine visits","immune system","months","sick visits","nasal brush samples","prevalent pathogen","general malaise","developing Th2","prospective birth cohort study","relative contribution of particular viruses","infancy","parents","Physical examination","hygiene hypothesis","smoking","year of life","parental history of atopy","relation","breast\u2010feeding","maturation","conclusion","coronavirus","day\u2010care"],"language":"en"},

Two fundamental questions are the biological relevance of these aggregates and their form of interaction in the membrane domain. Although in vitro experiments have shown the involvement of a GxxxG\u2010like motif, several crosslinking in vivo data are consistent with an almost opposite form of interaction between the transmembrane \u03B1\u2010helices. In the present work, we have explored these two questions using molecular dynamics simulations for all available integrin types. We have tested the hypothesis that homomeric interactions are evolutionary conserved, and essential for the cell, using conservative substitutions to filter out nonnative interactions. Our results show that two models, one involving a GxxxG\u2010like motif (model I) and an almost opposite form of interaction (model II) are conserved across all \u03B1 and \u03B2 integrin types, both in homodimers and homotrimers, with different specificities. No conserved interaction was found for homotetramers. Our results are completely independent from experimental data, both during molecular dynamics simulations and in the selection of the correct models.

However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS\u2010CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS\u2010CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole\u2010body level, immune\u2010mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS.

Eosinophils have been considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of virus\u2010induced asthma exacerbations. To determine how often asthma exacerbation is caused by virus infections and to examine the relationship between eosinophilia and asthma episode, we investigated 64 children who experienced asthma attacks between October 1999 and March 2000. We used rapid enzyme immunoassays to detect antigens of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus, and adenovirus in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) of these children, and enumerated eosinophils in the blood and NPS. We detected RSV in 27% and influenza A virus in 17% of the patients. No adenovirus infection or RSV/influenza A co\u2010infection was detected. RSV\u2010infected children were younger (3.85 \u00B1 0.83 years old) than influenza A virus\u2010infected patients (5.23 \u00B1 1.34 years old). Eighty\u2010two per cent of patients in the RSV group and 36% of patients in the influenza A virus group had moderate\u2010to\u2010severe asthma episodes (p \u003C 0.05). In RSV\u2010infected children, the eosinophil counts in NPS were higher in the \u2018severe\u2019 group, and younger patients had a greater number of eosinophils in their NPS than older patients (p \u003C 0.05). These trends were not found in influenza A virus patients. In conclusion, our results indicate that, compared with influenza A virus\u2010induced asthma attacks, RSV infection had a higher probability of being associated with asthma exacerbation in infants and younger children and induced attacks of greater severity. The increase in the number of eosinophils in the NPS of RSV\u2010infected children may be responsible, in part, for these differences.","publish_time":"2002-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Jing; Takamura, Mayumi; Yamaoka, Akiko; Odajima, Yasuhei; Iikura, Yoji","journal":"Pediatr Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/943ceeb132f28dae02a6a4320c59534a93b9a71a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168121.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","NPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus patients","influenza","NPS of RSV","virus group","RSV infection","RSV group","infected patients","pathogenesis of virus","younger patients","virus infections","infected children","induced asthma attacks","younger children","induced asthma exacerbations","older patients","cent of patients","severe asthma episodes","antigens of respiratory syncytial virus","significant cause of asthma exacerbation","adenovirus infection","greater number of eosinophils","co\u2010infection","enumerated eosinophils","Respiratory viral infection","induced attacks of greater severity","years old","higher probability","infants","relationship","nasopharyngeal secretions","rapid enzyme immunoassays","eosinophilia","important role","blood","results","increase","conclusion","trends","differences"],"language":"en"},

Treatment of sperm with phosphatidylinositol\u2010specific phospholipase C (PI\u2010PLC) released aminopeptidase activity from sperm and suppressed AR. These results suggest that the enzyme is located on the sperm surface via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)\u2010anchor and is involved in the AR. Immunoblot analysis showed that tyrosine residues of 40, 59, 68, and 72 kDa proteins were phosphorylated during induction of the AR. The 40 kDa protein was also recognized by anti\u2010c\u2010Src antibody by immunoblotting.

This review summarises the known structure and function of each of these essential viral envelope glycoproteins, and explores what is known about their close cooperation with each other in mediating cellular membrane fusion. It is suggested that, following gD binding to one of its entry receptors, membrane fusion is mediated by gB and the heterodimer gH/gL. Significantly, these four entry glycoproteins also play a key role in the interaction between HSV and the host immune system. The glycoproteins serve an important role as targets of adaptive immunity. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the same proteins also play a key role in initiating the early innate immune response to HSV. Understanding the complex functions of these HSV proteins may be essential for successful development of vaccines for HSV.

To arrest these worldwide trends, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Expert Panel\u0027s global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of COPD was published in 2001. Based on recently published clinical trials, the GOLD statement was updated in 2003. The Asia\u2013Pacific COPD Roundtable Group, a taskforce of expert respirologists from the Asia\u2013Pacific region, has recently formulated a consensus statement on implementation of the GOLD strategy for COPD in the Asia\u2013Pacific region. The key issues identified by the COPD Roundtable Group for comment are: (i) where there is no access to spirometry, diagnosis of COPD could be suspected on the basis of history, symptoms and physical signs; (ii) inhaled bronchodilators are the preferred regular treatment for COPD in the region, but oral bronchodilators may be considered if the cost of inhaled bronchodilators is a barrier to treatment; (iii) the use of an Metered Dose Inhaler with spacer in place of a nebulizer is recommended in the treatment of acute airflow obstruction in patients with COPD; (iv) influenza vaccination is recommended for all patients with COPD in communities where there is a high likelihood of Severe Acute Respitory Syndrome; and (v) simplified pulmonary rehabilitation programmes should be established in areas where comprehensive programmes are unavailable. Physical exercise training and education on smoking cessation should be core elements of any rehabilitation program. In summary, the COPD Roundtable Group supports implementation of the GOLD strategy for the diagnosis, management and prevention of COPD in the Asia\u2013Pacific region, subject to the additions and modifications to the guidelines suggested above.","publish_time":"2005-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd62b1c0ef2fe7d9f56c976ed23282b5a09d4abf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169139.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169139/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease","COPD","GOLD","Asia\u2013Pacific COPD Roundtable Group","COPD Roundtable Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of COPD","prevention of COPD","Pacific COPD Roundtable Group","Asia","Pacific region","GOLD strategy","GOLD statement","Expert Panel\u0027s global strategy","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","implementation","management","patients","cost of inhaled bronchodilators","oral bronchodilators","pulmonary rehabilitation programmes","Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease","treatment of acute airflow obstruction","preferred regular treatment","Global Initiative","physical signs","consensus statement","comprehensive programmes","taskforce of expert respirologists","Physical exercise training","high likelihood of Severe Acute Respitory Syndrome","smoking cessation","education","core elements","major public health problem","spacer","place","Metered Dose Inhaler","prevalence","areas","additions","subject","mortality","symptoms","use","basis of history","communities","barrier","worldwide trends","key issues","modifications","nebulizer","clinical trials","influenza vaccination","access","spirometry","comment","summary","guidelines"],"language":"en"},

Initial studies of SAFV focused on respiratory and gastrointestinal infection; however, it has also recently been associated with diverse clinical symptoms including the endocrine, cardiovascular, and neurological systems. Given the systemic nature of SAFV, and its high prevalence, understanding its pathogenicity and clinical impact is of utmost importance. This comprehensive review highlights and discusses recent developments in epidemiology, human pathogenicity, animal, and molecular studies related to SAFV. It also provides detailed insights into the neuropathogenicity of SAFV. We argue that human studies have been confounded by coinfections and therefore require support from robust molecular and animal research. Thereby, we aim to provide foresight into further research to better understand this emerging virus.","publish_time":"2016-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Shawn Zheng Kai; Tan, Mark Zheng Yi; Prabakaran, Mookkan","journal":"Rev Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/953c601ac5bef62d025d2c4f98e6c6a86d9cf749.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neuropathogenicity of SAFV","Initial studies of SAFV","human studies","human pathogenicity","molecular studies","systemic nature of SAFV","animal research","emerging human cardiovirus","emerging virus","clinical impact","Saffold virus","diverse clinical symptoms","recent developments","endocrine","epidemiology","support","comprehensive review highlights","coinfections","high prevalence","utmost importance","neurological systems","detailed insights","gastrointestinal infection","foresight"],"language":"en"},

Recent outbreaks of emergent viral pathogens, such as West Nile virus, and the use of live vaccinia virus as a vaccine have prompted a reassessment of the viral safety of plasma\u2010derived products. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of current viral inactivation methods for West Nile and vaccinia viruses and to reassess the use of model viruses to predict inactivation of similar viral pathogens. Materials and Methods Virus\u2010spiked product intermediates were processed using a downscaled representation of various manufacturing procedures. Virus infectivity was measured before and after processing to determine virus inactivation. Results The results demonstrated effective inactivation of West Nile virus, vaccinia virus and a model virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, during pasteurization, solvent/detergent treatment and caprylate treatment. Caprylate provided rapid and effective inactivation of West Nile virus, vaccinia virus, duck hepatitis B virus and Sindbis virus. Inactivation of West Nile virus was similar to that of bovine viral diarrhoea virus. Conclusions This study demonstrates that procedures used to inactivate enveloped viruses in manufacturing processes can achieve inactivation of West Nile virus and vaccinia virus. In addition, the data support the use of model viruses to predict the inactivation of similar emergent viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2004-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Remington, K. M.; Trejo, S.

It is extremely common in infancy; 20-30% of children have experienced recurrent episodic wheezing by the age of 12 months. Wheezing may result from widespread peripheral airway narrowing or, less commonly, from localized central disease. Excluding recurrent viral wheezing and asthma-like symptoms, all other specific causes of wheezing (e.g. cystic fibrosis, congenital airway disorders, chronic lung disease of prematurity) affect only 2-3% of the population. Although wheezing disease preceded by acute viral bronchiolitis early in infancy features prominently in most articles on childhood asthma, it affects, at most, 1% of the population. The increased prevalence of reported wheezing in industrialized countries until the mid-1990s, accompanied by an increase in the number of hospital admissions for wheezing, represents a true increase in the problem rather than simply increased awareness. In the UK, wheezing in pre-school children accounts for about 25% of acute hospital admissions in childhood, and almost 50% during epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.","publish_time":"2003-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silverman, Michael","journal":"Medicine (Abingdon)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172288/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wheezing disease","recurrent viral wheezing","specific causes of wheezing","experienced recurrent episodic wheezing","increased prevalence of reported wheezing","acute hospital admissions","childhood asthma","population","acute viral bronchiolitis","number of hospital admissions","localized central disease","chronic lung disease of prematurity","infancy features","true increase","increased awareness","congenital airway disorders","widespread peripheral airway","pre-school children accounts","cystic fibrosis","industrialized countries","RSV","age","symptoms","epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus","infection","problem","articles","UK","months","Wheeze","diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

Recent findings on the genome organization, its relationship to other viruses, the replication of HCV ribonucleic acid, HCV translation, and HCV polyprotein expression and processing are discussed. Also reviewed are virus assembly and release, the variability of HCV and its classification into genotypes, the geographic distribution of HCV genotypes, and the biologic differences between HCV genotypes. The assays used in HCV genotyping are discussed in terms of reliability and consistency of results, and the molecular epidemiology of HCV infection is reviewed.

In order to slow down the wave of infection, the state has severely restricted economic activity in Germany. As a result, GDP is expected to shrink by 4.2% this year. The recession is leaving clear traces on the labour market and the national budget. At its peak, the unemployment rate will soar to 5.9% and the number of short-time workers to 2.4 million. This year, the fiscal policy stabilisation measures will lead to a record deficit in the general government budget of 159 billion euro. After the shutdown, the economy will gradually recover. Accordingly, the increase in GDP next year will be strong at 5.8%. This forecast is associated with considerable downside risks, e.g. because the pandemic can be slowed faster or because the recovery of economic activity will be less successful than expected or there may be a new wave of infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holtem\u00F6ller, Oliver; Kooths, Stefan; Michelsen, Claus; Schmidt, Torsten; Wollmersh\u00E4user, Timo","journal":"Wirtschaftsdienst","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7174812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["year","German economy","restricted economic activity","recovery of economic activity","result","GDP","leading German economic research institutes","new wave of infection","national budget","corona pandemic","general government budget","record deficit","labour market","state","fiscal policy stabilisation measures","drastic slump","clear traces","considerable downside risks","number of short","time workers","forecast","euro","Germany","peak","unemployment rate","recession","increase","order","shutdown"],"language":"en"},

As seasonal influenza occurs on an annual basis, the circulating virus strains are closely monitored and a yearly updated vaccination is provided, especially to identified risk populations. Nonetheless, influenza virus infection may result in pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, frequently complicated by bacterial coinfection. Pandemics are, in contrary, unexpected rare events related to the emergence of a reassorted human-pathogenic influenza A virus (IAV) strains that often causes increased morbidity and spreads extremely rapidly in the immunologically naive human population, with huge clinical and economic impact. Accordingly, particular efforts are made to advance our knowledge on the disease biology and pathology and recent studies have brought new insights into IAV adaptation mechanisms to the human host, as well as into the key players in disease pathogenesis on the host side. Current antiviral strategies are only efficient at the early stages of the disease and are challenged by the genomic instability of the virus, highlighting the need for novel antiviral therapies targeting the pulmonary host response to improve viral clearance, reduce the risk of bacterial coinfection, and prevent or attenuate acute lung injury. This review article summarizes our current knowledge on the molecular basis of influenza infection and disease progression, the key players in pathogenesis driving severe disease and progression to lung failure, as well as available and envisioned prevention and treatment strategies against influenza virus infection.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peteranderl, Christin; Herold, Susanne; Schmoldt, Carole","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d36127316eef193a0219378f1af60d05f576b111.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7174870.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7174870/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus infection","seasonal influenza","influenza viruses","pandemic influenza","disease progression","disease pathogenesis","molecular basis of influenza infection","severe disease","disease biology","reassorted human-pathogenic influenza","human host","circulating virus strains","key players","acute respiratory failure","Current antiviral strategies","current knowledge","lung failure","risk of bacterial coinfection","pulmonary host response","naive human population","acute lung injury","annual basis","treatment strategies","risk populations","IAV adaptation mechanisms","novel antiviral therapies","faces of respiratory infections","new insights","recent studies","emergence","pathology","pneumonia","viral clearance","envisioned prevention","unexpected rare events","need","economic impact","increased morbidity","early stages","spreads","review article","humans","genomic instability","yearly updated vaccination","Pandemics","particular efforts"],"language":"en"},

Many applications of social media analytics, from pandemic prediction to earthquake response, require an in-depth understanding of how these patterns change when human encounter unfamiliar conditions. In this paper, we select two earthquakes in China as the social context in Sina-Weibo (or Weibo for short), the largest Chinese microblog site. After proposing a formalized Weibo information flow model to represent the information spread on Weibo, we study the information spread from three main perspectives: individual characteristics, the types of social relationships between interactive participants, and the topology of real interaction networks. The quantitative analyses draw the following conclusions. First, the shadow of Dunbar\u2019s number is evident in the \u201Cdeclared friends/followers\u201D distributions, and the number of each participant\u2019s friends/followers who also participated in the earthquake information dissemination show the typical power-law distribution, indicating a rich-gets-richer phenomenon. Second, an individual\u2019s number of followers is the most critical factor in user influence. Strangers are very important forces for disseminating real-time news after an earthquake. Third, two types of real interaction networks share the scale-free and small-world property, but with a looser organizational structure. In addition, correlations between different influence groups indicate that when compared with other online social media, the discussion on Weibo is mainly dominated and influenced by verified users.","publish_time":"2018-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/276249381f8998bcdee56166802344f2583ef0de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176041.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176041/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["social context","online social media","Sina-Weibo","applications of social media analytics","types of social relationships","earthquake information dissemination","formalized Weibo information flow model","individual\u2019s number of followers","earthquake response","types of real interaction networks","topology of real interaction networks","shadow of Dunbar\u2019s number","new quantitative insights of human activity patterns","quantitative analyses","user influence","participant\u2019s friends","different influence groups","human encounter unfamiliar conditions","scale-free","pandemic prediction","individual characteristics","interactive participants","typical power-law distribution","small-world property","main perspectives","critical factor","important forces","largest Chinese microblog site","addition","correlations","real-time news","earthquakes","China","in-depth understanding","discussion","looser organizational structure","following conclusions","distributions","richer phenomenon","Strangers","verified users","paper"],"language":"en"},

The CDV Cornell A75-17 strain produces a delayed, subacute to chronic, demyelinating CNS disease. In contrast, the Snyder Hill (CDV-SH) strain-associated neurological disease is more acute in onset, is usually non-demyelinating and primarily produces lesions in the gray matter. In these studies we describe the effects of these two virulent and one avirulent CDV strain, Rockborn (CDV-RO), on astrocytes in dissociated canine brain cell cultures. In multiple replicate experiments, astrocytes were infected most rapidly by CDV-RO [100% of astrocytes were infected by 14 days post-inoculation (pi.)]. This strain caused severe cytopathic effect (CPE) and cytolysis. CDV-SH similarly produced a rapid infection of the astrocytes. In contrast, CDV A75-17 infected less than 25% of the astrocyte population during the first 28 days p.i. (\u00B1 7 days); after 28 days p.i., a rapid rise in astrocyte infection occurred. Both virulent viruses caused astrocytic syncytial formation but did not cause cytolysis of the astrocyte population as was observed with the attenuated virus. Titers of infectious virus, released into the supernatant fluid, reflected the degree of astrocyte infection. Virus released by the cultures late in CDV A75-17 infection showed enhanced ability to infect newly derived astrocytes; in contrast, brain cell passaged CDV-SH did not show increased growth in these cells. These results show that (1) there is a difference in growth rate, CPE and capacity for adaptation of three different CDV strains in astrocytes in vitro, and (2) some aspects of the disease (such as persistence in white matter) produced by the virulent strains in vivo may be related to the course of astrocyte infection observed in vitro.","publish_time":"2004-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pearce-Kelling, Susan; Mitchell, William J.; Summers, Brian A.; Appel, Max J.G.","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135698/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Snyder Hill"],"organizations":["CDV Cornell","CNS","CDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CDV-SH","CDV A75","CDV-RO","avirulent CDV strain","CDV Cornell A75","different CDV strains","degree of astrocyte infection","course of astrocyte infection","derived astrocytes","rapid infection","astrocyte population","viral strain","contrast","virulent strains","attenuated virus","Canine distemper virus","CPE","neurological disease","demyelinating CNS disease","virulent viruses","cytolysis","days post-inoculation","Titers of infectious virus","dissociated canine brain cell cultures","non-demyelinating","growth rate","rapid rise","increased growth","white matter","gray matter","capacity","adaptation","enhanced ability","onset","Rockborn","astrocytic syncytial formation","severe cytopathic effect","Snyder Hill","lesions","supernatant fluid","dogs","difference","multiple replicate experiments","persistence","encephalomyelitis","cells","effects","studies","aspects","results"],"language":"en"},

Exciting recent progress has been made in the characterization of the viral genotypic features involved in FeLV-associated diseases. Molecular studies have clearly defined the causal role of variant FeLV env gene determinants in two disorders: the T-lymphocyte cytopathicity and the clinical acute immuno-suppression induced by the FeLV-FAIDS variant and the pure red cell aplasia induced by FeLV-C/Sarma. Variant or enFeLV env sequences also appear to play a role in FeLV-associated lymphomas. Additional studies are required to determine the host cell processes that are perturbed by these variant env gene products. In the case of the FeLV-FAIDS variant, the aberrant env gene products appear to impair superinfection interference, resulting in accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA and cell death. In other cases it is likely that the viral env proteins interact with host products that are important in cell viability and/or proliferation. Understanding of these mechanisms will therefore provide insights to factors involved in normal The haematological consequences of FIV are quite similar to those associated with HIV. As with HIV, FIV does not appear to directly infect myeloid or erythroid precursors, and the mechanisms of marrow suppression likely involve virus, viral antigen, and/or infected accessory cells in the marrow microenvironment. Studies using in vitro experimental models are required to define the effects of each of these microenvironmental elements on haematopoietic progenitors. As little is known about the molecular mechanisms of FIV pathogenesis, additional studies of disease-inducing FIV strains are needed to identify the genotypic features that correlate with virulent phenotypic features. Finally, experimental FIV infection in cats provides the opportunity to correlate in vivo virological and haematological changes with in vitro observations in a large animal model that closely mimics HIV infection in man.","publish_time":"2006-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linenberger, Michael L.; Abkowitz, Janis L.","journal":"Baillieres Clin Haematol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FeLV-FAIDS variant","variant env gene products","FeLV-C","viral env proteins","host cell factors","FeLV-associated lymphomas","FeLV-associated diseases","causal role of variant FeLV env gene determinants","aberrant env gene products","host products","viral genotypic features","cell viability","cell death","host cell processes","haematological consequences of FIV","FIV strains","experimental FIV infection","Molecular studies","molecular mechanisms of FIV pathogenesis","mechanisms of marrow suppression","viral antigen","HIV infection","enFeLV env sequences","additional studies of disease","pure red cell aplasia","marrow microenvironment","haematological changes","haematological malignancies","experimental models","variety of marrow suppressive disorders","accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA","virulent phenotypic features","useful models","clinical acute immuno-suppression","T-lymphocyte cytopathicity","observations","lentivirus infections","large animal model","infected accessory cells","superinfection interference","opportunity","microenvironmental elements","cats","characterization","Feline oncornavirus","erythroid precursors","haematopoietic progenitors","effects","insights","Exciting recent progress","proliferation","Sarma","man","cases"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that decreased serum S1P level is associated with the clinical outcomes of ARDS and polymorphisms in the S1P gene are associated with serum S1P levels. METHODS: This multicenter prospective study includes ARDS patients and healthy blood donors as controls. Serum S1P levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Eight tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the S1P gene were detected, and their associations with S1P levels were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 121 ARDS patients and 100 healthy individuals were enrolled. Serum S1P levels were lower in ARDS patients than in controls (P \u003C 0.001). Decreased S1P levels correlated with more organ dysfunction and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores. Changes in S1P levels in ARDS patients were associated with the clinical outcomes. The recessive model for SNP rs3743631 suggests that GG homozygote is associate with a higher risk for ARDS. The dominant model for SNP rs907045 suggests that AA or TA genotype might increase the risk for ARDS. In ARDS patients, the rs3743631 GG genotype showed lower S1P levels than those harboring AG and AA genotypes. The serum S1P levels of rs907045 AA or TA genotype patients were lower than those of TT genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Serum S1P levels are dramatically decreased in ARDS patients. Reduced S1P levels are associated with worse clinical outcomes. There is a significant association between S1P rs3743631, rs907045 polymorphisms and susceptibility of ARDS.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Jiangnan; Tan, Yan; Wang, Li; Su, Xin; Shi, Yi","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43070120d03543d305a0d1e8bbece4aeb49ca409.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7137241.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137241/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","SNP","TA","GG","AG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower S1P levels","Decreased S1P levels","ARDS patients","S1P rs3743631","Reduced S1P levels","S1P gene","serum S1P levels of rs907045 AA","decreased serum S1P level","susceptibility of ARDS","clinical outcomes of ARDS","TA genotype patients","rs907045 polymorphisms","rs3743631 GG genotype","SNP rs907045","SNP rs3743631","TT genotype","worse clinical outcomes","AA genotypes","higher risk","controls","higher Acute Physiology","GG homozygote","healthy individuals","tag single nucleotide polymorphisms","recessive model","dominant model","healthy blood donors","pathophysiologic progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome","organ dysfunction","Chronic Health Evaluation","roles","SNPs","multicenter prospective study","endothelial barrier function","immune modulation","significant association","scores","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","phospholipid","Changes","METHODS","Sphingosine","phosphate","total","associations","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To assess the potential for FGF2 to play a role in remyelination, we examined the expression pattern of FGF2 and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in an experimental demyelinating disease with extensive remyelination. Adult mice were intracranially injected with murine hepatitis virus strain A\u201059 (MHV\u2010A59) to induce focally demyelinated spinal cord lesions that spontaneously remyelinate, with corresponding recovery of motor function. Using kinetic RT\u2010PCR analysis of spinal cord RNA, we found significantly increased levels of FGF2 mRNA transcripts, which peaked during the initial stage of remyelination. Analysis of tissue sections demonstrated that increased levels of FGF2 mRNA and protein were localized within demyelinated regions of white matter, including high FGF2 expression associated with astrocytes. The expression of corresponding FGF receptors was significantly increased in lesion areas during the initial stage of remyelination. In normal and lesioned white matter, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, including progenitors and mature cells, were found to express multiple FGFR types (FGFR1, FGFR2, and/or FGFR3). In addition, in lesion areas, astrocytes expressed FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. These findings indicate that, during remyelination, FGF2 may play a role in directly regulating oligodendrocyte lineage cell responses and may also act through paracrine or autocrine effects on astrocytes, which are known to synthesize other growth factors and immunoregulatory molecules that influence oligodendrocyte lineage cells.

Here, using chlamydia DNA as a clinically relevant target and high-throughput sequencing as an analytical tool, we investigate a potential mechanism of non-specific amplification. We then develop a real-time digital LAMP (dLAMP) with high-resolution melting temperature (HRM) analysis and use this single-molecule approach to analyze approximately 1.2 million amplification events. We show that single-molecule HRM provides insight into specific and non-specific amplification in LAMP that are difficult to deduce from bulk measurements. We use real-time dLAMP with HRM to evaluate differences between polymerase enzymes, the impact of assay parameters (e.g. time, rate or florescence intensity), and the effect background human DNA.

The use of modRNA in basic and translational science is rising, due to the clinical potential of modRNA. We are currently using modRNA to induce cardiac regeneration post-ischemic injury. Major obstacles in using modRNA for cardiac ischemic disease include the need for the direct and single administration of modRNA to the heart and the inefficient translation of modRNA due to its short half-life. Modulation of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) to enhance translation efficiency in ischemic cardiac disease has great value, as it can reduce the amount of modRNA needed per delivery and will achieve higher and longer protein production post-single delivery. Here, we identified that 5\u2032 UTR, from the fatty acid metabolism gene carboxylesterase 1D (Ces1d), enhanced the translation of firefly luciferase (Luc) modRNA by 2-fold in the heart post-myocardial infarction (MI). Moreover, we identified, in the Ces1d, a specific RNA element (element D) that is responsible for the improvement of modRNA translation and leads to a 2.5-fold translation increment over Luc modRNA carrying artificial 5\u2032 UTR, post-MI. Importantly, we were able to show that 5\u2032 UTR Ces1d also enhances modRNA translation in the liver, but not in the kidney, post-ischemic injury, indicating that Ces1d 5\u2032 UTR and element D may play a wider role in translation of protein under an ischemic condition.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sultana, Nishat; Hadas, Yoav; Sharkar, Mohammad Tofael Kabir; Kaur, Keerat; Magadum, Ajit; Kurian, Ann Anu; Hossain, Nadia; Alburquerque, Bremy; Ahmed, Sakib; Chepurko, Elena; Zangi, Lior","journal":"Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/405b7718d791bd847e96ddbdf42dab4595ec58f2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bb7bd36d339ab3bbf2c5db220400efc99fb5e95d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150433.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150433/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Luc modRNA","inefficient translation of modRNA","improvement of modRNA translation","use of modRNA","single administration of modRNA","clinical potential of modRNA","translation of protein","UTR Ces1d","translation efficiency","single gene","cardiac ischemic disease","ischemic cardiac disease","fold translation increment","cardiac regeneration post-ischemic injury","element D","ischemic condition","translation of firefly luciferase","gene-delivery platform","longer protein production post-single delivery","gene transfer","heart post-myocardial infarction","specific RNA element","fatty acid metabolism gene carboxylesterase","need","genes","wider role","great value","different cell types","kidney","translational science","safe vector","Major obstacles","tissues","untranslated region","innate immune system","Modified mRNA","short half-life","Modulation","genome integrity"],"language":"en"},

While hepatic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is well known as a key enzyme for gluconeogenesis, the role of muscle fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 2 (Fbp2) in glucose disposal and thermogenesis is unknown. Here, using Fbp2 knockout (KO) mice, we assessed the physiological role of Fbp2 in energy and glucose metabolism and thermogenesis. In vivo assessments of energy metabolism, glucose metabolism, and thermogenesis were performed by indirect calorimetry, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and cold challenge studies, respectively. Under both feeding and fasting conditions, Fbp2 KO mice showed similar phenotypes regarding energy and glucose metabolism compared to wild-type (WT) mice. However, Fbp2 KO mice were severely intolerant to cold challenge under fasting conditions. Mechanistically, the cold-induced intramuscular conversion of lactate to glycogen (glyconeogenesis) is completely abolished in the KO muscle, which leads to a lack of glycogen source for thermogenesis in Fbp2 KO mice. The cold-intolerant phenotype of KO mice disappeared after feeding, and the KO mice were equally as cold tolerant as the WT mice and survived during the cold challenge for three weeks. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Fbp2 is essential for muscle thermogenesis by replenishing the intramuscular glycogen pool through glyconeogenesis when the exogenous glucose source is limited. These data imply the physiological importance of Fbp2 in thermal homeostasis and suggest a potential novel therapy targeted to increase glycogen replenishment upon cold stress.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Hyun-Jun; Jang, Hye Rim; Park, Shi-Young; Kim, Young-Bum; Lee, Hui-Young; Choi, Cheol Soo","journal":"Exp Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f18cab086f10fd4299c808eb80badb8a79fddcf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156669.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Fbp2 KO mice","KO muscle","glucose metabolism","muscle thermogenesis","cold-intolerant phenotype of KO mice","WT mice","Fbp2 knockout","glucose disposal","physiological role of Fbp2","cold stress","physiological importance of Fbp2","cold challenge studies","exogenous glucose source","assessments of energy metabolism","role of muscle fructose","glycogen replenishment","Skeletal muscle","intramuscular glycogen pool","lack of glycogen source","glyconeogenesis","fasting conditions","bisphosphatase","data","hepatic fructose","intramuscular conversion of lactate","similar phenotypes","thermal homeostasis","hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp","major organ","potential novel therapy","wild-type","indirect calorimetry","gluconeogenesis","key enzyme","weeks"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this prospective, observational study was to investigate the relationship between serum HMGB1 concentrations and composite of morbidity endpoints in cardiac surgery. Arterial blood samples for HMGB1 measurement were collected from 250 patients after anaesthetic induction (baseline) and 1 h after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (post-CPB). The incidence of composite of morbidity endpoints (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure and prolonged ventilator care) was compared in relation to the tertile distribution of serum HMGB1 concentrations. The incidence of composite of morbidity endpoints was significantly different with respect to the tertile distribution of post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations (p = 0.005) only, and not to the baseline. Multivariable analysis revealed post-CPB HMGB1 concentration (OR, 1.072; p = 0.044), pre-operative creatinine and duration of CPB as independent risk factors of adverse outcome. Accounting for its prominent role in mediating sterile inflammation and its relation to detrimental outcome, HMGB1 measured 1 h after weaning from CPB would serve as a useful biomarker for accurate risk stratification in cardiac surgical patients and may guide tailored anti-inflammatory therapy.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Namo; Lee, Sak; Lee, Jeong-Rim; Kwak, Young-Lan; Jun, Ji-Hae; Shim, Jae-Kwang","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e8c3862afecfb92067189a7e3e316ae2b1022ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156763.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156763/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multivariable"],"organizations":["CPB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HMGB1 measurement","tertile distribution of post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations","tertile distribution of serum HMGB1 concentrations","composite of morbidity endpoints","duration of CPB","incidence of composite","cardiac surgical patients","Outcomes of cardiac surgery","baseline","potential role","prognostic biomarker","useful biomarker","detrimental outcome","prominent role","sterile inflammation","systemic inflammation","independent risk factors of adverse outcome","accurate risk stratification","renal failure","stroke","myocardial infarction","death","relationship","respect","prolonged ventilator care","pre-operative creatinine","Multivariable analysis","pivotal inflammatory mediator","observational study","tailored anti-inflammatory therapy","High mobility group box","Arterial blood samples","cardiopulmonary bypass","cardiovascular disease","anaesthetic induction","aim","Accounting"],"language":"en"},

After staining, bacterial pathogens were recognized in the light microscope because of their size and could be cultivated in culture media. Viruses evaded this approach, as they are significantly smaller, and as obligate parasites are not able to multiply in cell culture media. Although some viral infections could be associated with specific cellular changes and certain depositions in the infected tissue around the turn of the century, e.g. Negri inclusion bodies in nerve cells during rabies, a specific diagnosis was only possible through the development of cell culture methods and modern molecular biology. Today, viral infections can be detected directly by determining the agents, individual viral proteins, or their genetic information, or other materials in the blood of infected people or animals by using appropriate methods. Direct detection of viruses is possible, with the exception of latent or persistent infection forms, only during the acute phase of the disease. In some cases, the pathogens are present in the infected organism only before the symptomatic phase, so the direct detection of the virus is frequently not successful. Therefore, infections or contact with pathogens is usually demonstrated in virus diagnostics indirectly by characterization of the developing specific immune response.","publish_time":"2013-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Sch\u00E4tzl, Hermann","journal":"Molecular Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20e0b6dd4e565a888e8fda20f7f3cb3d1bea2b08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123206.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections","detection of bacterial infections","bacterial pathogens","cell culture media","Direct detection of viruses","development of cell culture methods","infected tissue","infected organism","specific diagnosis","appropriate methods","blood of infected people","specific cellular changes","individual viral proteins","developing specific immune response","symptomatic phase","acute phase","virus diagnostics","nerve cells","Negri inclusion bodies","rabies","characterization","certain depositions","exception of latent","modern molecular biology","century","persistent infection forms","materials","animals","genetic information","turn","light microscope","obligate parasites","size","agents","approach","disease","cases","staining"],"language":"en"},

Both hyperinflammation and immune suppression ensue, to an extent that is harmful to the host. The inflammatory balance is disturbed, and this is associated with a failure to return to homeostasis. All pathogens with sufficient load and virulence can cause sepsis, after they succeed to adhere and pass the mucosal barrier of the host. The host defense system can recognize molecular components of invading pathogens, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), with specialized receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Through several signaling pathways, overstimulation of PRRs has proinflammatory and immune suppressive consequences. Hyperinflammation is characterized by activation of target genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines (leukocyte activation), inefficient use of the complement system, activation of the coagulation system, and concurrent downregulation of anticoagulant mechanisms and necrotic cell death. The release of endogenous molecules by injured cells, called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or alarmins, leads to deterioration in a vicious cycle by further stimulation of PRRs. Features of immune suppression are massive apoptosis and thereby depletion of immune cells, reprogramming of monocytes and macrophages to a state of a decreased capacity to release proinflammatory cytokines and a disturbed balance in cellular metabolic processes.","publish_time":"2017-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Engelen, Tjitske S.

The infection of plants by Agrobacterium rhizogenes results in a hairy root (HR) phenotype characterized by rapid growth in hormone-free medium, an unusual ageotropism and extensive lateral branching. These genetically transformed root cultures (hairy roots) can produce levels of secondary metabolites comparable to that of intact plants. Hairy root cultures offer promise for high production and productivity of valuable secondary metabolites in many plants. High stability and productivity features allow the exploitation of HRs as valuable biotechnological tool for the production of plant secondary metabolites. While these chemical compounds are employed by plants for interactions with their environment, humans have long since explored and exploited plant secondary metabolites for medicinal and practical uses. The main constraint for commercial exploitation of hairy root cultivations is the development and scaling up of appropriate reactor vessels (bioreactors) that permit the growth of interconnected tissues normally unevenly distributed throughout the vessel. Emphasis has focused on designing appropriate bioreactors suitable to culture the delicate and sensitive plant hairy roots. To this end, hairy root culture presents an excellent platform for producing valuable secondary metabolites. For these reasons, this chapter describes the establishment of hairy roots and production of secondary metabolites from hairy roots of cucurbits and also phytochemicals uses for biological activity.","publish_time":"2017-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rekha, Kaliyaperumal; Thiruvengadam, Muthu","journal":"Transgenesis and Secondary Metabolism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f49ae69ee991e2a8d37703ff1566ab2a4f6eba14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123301.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123301/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of secondary metabolites","Hairy root cultures","hairy roots of cucurbits","production of plant secondary metabolites","productivity of valuable secondary metabolites","establishment of hairy roots","sensitive plant hairy roots","exploited plant secondary metabolites","levels of secondary metabolites comparable","commercial exploitation of hairy root cultivations","transformed root cultures","high production","infection of plants","intact plants","valuable biotechnological tool","valuable traditional medicine","appropriate bioreactors suitable","exploitation of HRs","productivity features","rapid growth","High stability","practical uses","appropriate reactor vessels","growth of interconnected tissues","unusual ageotropism","excellent platform","hormone-free medium","Agrobacterium rhizogenes results","phenotype","promise","phytochemicals","development","extensive lateral branching","main constraint","important group of vegetables","interactions","chapter","humans","nutritional significance","environment","end","biological activity","chemical compounds","reasons","Emphasis"],"language":"en"},

Propolis is a sticky resinous substance, which is gathered from buds and the bark of trees. It is also known as \u201Cbee glue\u201D as bees use it to cover surfaces, seal holes and close gaps in their hives, thus providing a sterile environment that protects them from microbes and spore-producing organisms, including fungi and molds. It can be considered to be a potent chemical weapon against bacteria, viruses, and other pathogenic microorganisms that may invade the bee colony. Also, bees use propolis as an embalming substance, to mummify invaders such as other insects, that have been killed and are too heavy to remove from the colony. Thus, propolis is important for bee health but it also has activity against many human diseases. It is a powerful anti-oxidant and can modulate the activity of reactive oxygen species within the human body. The most studied aspect of propolis is its anti-bacterial activity, which is almost always present at a moderate to high level depending on the exact type of propolis. It is in general more active against Gram positive than Gram negative bacteria, but activity against Gram negative bacteria has been observed. Propolis has been found to be active against a range of viruses and also is almost always active against protozoa such as Tryanosoma brucei and Leishmania donovani. Propolis also shows activity against cardiovascular diseases and diabetes and has immunomodulatory effects. Anti-cancer activity has also been observed. In summary, propolis is remarkable for its range of biological activities and for the variety of its chemical composition. It may be of great importance both to bees and humans.","publish_time":"2017-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siheri, Weam; Alenezi, Sameah; Tusiimire, Jonans; Watson, David G.","journal":"Bee Products - Chemical and Biological Properties","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c8bb310c943d3335a020abfd096fa1a3d8e8eb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123330.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123330/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leishmania"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["term propolis","exact type of propolis","studied aspect of propolis","anti-bacterial activity","Anti-cancer activity","bees","Gram negative bacteria","bee colony","activity of reactive oxygen species","Gram positive","range of viruses","human diseases","bee health","bee glue","city","defence","powerful anti-oxidant","cardiovascular diseases","embalming substance","human body","chemical composition","range of biological activities","potent chemical weapon","sticky resinous substance","hives","high level","close gaps","Tryanosoma brucei","surfaces","diabetes","seal holes","microbes","variety","protozoa","Greek words","pathogenic microorganisms","Leishmania donovani","immunomodulatory effects","fungi","spore","sterile environment","buds","invaders","great importance","humans","bark of trees","molds","beehive","summary","insects"],"language":"en"},

In 1990, Romania inherited a functional and quite efficient epidemiological surveillance system from the former communist regime, based on pyramidal and autocratic principles where the state control was absolute. In 2001, the assessment conducted by WHO/Europe showed many unsatisfactory elements of the remaining epidemiological surveillance system for communicable diseases, with a lack of procedures, poor microbiology laboratory capacities, and overlapping responsibilities. The lack of a coordinating body was evident, especially during bioterrorist threats following 9/11 attacks in New York. In 2003 and 2004, the PHARE Project offered an important opportunity for Romania to improve the Romanian System of Epidemiological Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases. At the end of this project many of the technical capacities had been improved, specialized trainings of epidemiologists and microbiologists were carried out, and a coordinating body of the epidemiological surveillance network was established [1]. Furthermore, a National Plan of Action was approved by the Minister of Health with the declared objective to improve the system in order to comply with EU standards. At present, the National Institute of Public Health hosts the National Center for Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Control which coordinates the epidemiological network and serves as the Romanian focal point for international institutions such as WHO and ECDC. Each year, comprehensive reports regarding surveillance in Romania of many communicable diseases are published, including diseases potentially related to bioterrorism. Until now, no evidence of a bioterrorism event has been registered in Romania.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rafila, Alexandru; Pitigoi, Daniela","journal":"Biopreparedness and Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f674dd5b4de706915b2d2f4ba47917bbd3c598b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123331.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123331/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO/Europe","PHARE Project","Epidemiological Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases","EU","National Institute of Public Health","ECDC"],"locations":["New York","Romania"],"keyphrases":["Communicable Diseases Surveillance","Romanian System of Epidemiological Surveillance","epidemiological surveillance network","efficient epidemiological surveillance system","remaining epidemiological surveillance system","Control of Communicable Diseases","epidemiological network","health threats","state control","National Center","National Institute of Public Health","Minister of Health","coordinating body","bioterrorism event","Countering bioterrorism","National Plan of Action","bioterrorist threats","lack of procedures","technical capacities","PHARE Project","Romanian focal point","poor microbiology laboratory capacities","good preparedness","unsatisfactory elements","international institutions","autocratic principles","infectious agents","communist regime","important opportunity","declared objective","early warning","specialized trainings of epidemiologists","attacks","order","comprehensive reports","New York","microbiologists","response","Europe","responsibilities","present","year","EU standards","ECDC","evidence","assessment","end"],"language":"en"},

Many seemingly harmless symbionts of a wide array of taxonomic groups are triggered to become pathogenic or virulent, and we provide several examples of the provoking (stimulating) triggers, with the understanding that in most cases, the conditions for the triggered activities are much more complex and complicated than presented. Examples of triggers follow: environmental ones like temperature, toxic chemicals (dose), chemotherapeutics, dietary changes, and geographic habits; internal ones like host site, host resistance or susceptibility, and host modifications; and combinations of these and other conditions. We provide examples involving multiple triggers for organisms associated with termites, for an endemic virus being affected by multiple factors and having multiple effects on its commercial penaeid shrimp hosts, and for contrasting variables associated with two exotic viruses in wild and cultured commercial penaeid shrimps with an emphasis on hypothesizing how the pathogenicity developed in these two viruses. The chapter ends by trying to answer the question of why would a symbiont become pathogenic in some hosts and not in others from an evolutionary perspective. It uses two hypotheses to explain the increased virulence.","publish_time":"2016-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Overstreet, Robin M.; Lotz, Jeffrey M.","journal":"The Rasputin Effect: When Commensals and Symbionts Become Parasitic","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2beb7c564e71fd0ab71e6b692b803728f391737e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123458.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123458/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiple triggers","Examples of triggers","host site","host resistance","host modifications","symbiotic organism","multiple effects","multiple factors","associated conflicts","conditions","terms","chapter","commercial penaeid shrimp hosts","internal ones","cultured commercial penaeid shrimps","environmental ones","exotic viruses","triggered activities","geographic habits","dose","chemotherapeutics","toxic chemicals","emphasis","temperature","susceptibility","dietary changes","contrasting variables","termites","wide array of taxonomic groups","primary associations","hypothesizing","endemic virus","interrelationships","organisms","harmless symbionts","conflicting views","symbiosis","details","interpretation","pathogenicity","terminology","cases","combinations","hypotheses","increased virulence","meanings","confusion","differentiation","author","disease","definition","understanding","mentioned readers","parasite","provoking","pathologic response","evolutionary perspective","infection","title","question","habitat"],"language":"en"},

The first function identified for Arf proteins was recruitment of cytosolic coat complexes to membranes to mediate vesicle formation. However, subsequent studies have uncovered additional functions, including roles in plasma membrane signalling pathways, cytoskeleton regulation, lipid droplet function, and non-vesicular lipid transport. In contrast to other families of G proteins, there are only a few Arf proteins in each organism, yet they function specifically at many different cellular locations. Part of this specificity is achieved by formation of complexes with their guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that catalyse GTP binding and hydrolysis, respectively. Because these regulators outnumber their Arf substrates by at least 3-to-1, an important aspect of understanding Arf function is elucidating the mechanisms by which a single Arf protein is incorporated into different GEF, GAP, and effector complexes. New insights into these mechanisms have come from recent studies showing GEF\u2013effector interactions, Arf activation cascades, and positive feedback loops. A unifying theme in the function of Arf proteins, carried out in conjunction with their regulators and effectors, is sensing and modulating the properties of the lipids that make up cellular membranes.","publish_time":"2014-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jackson, Catherine L.","journal":"Ras Superfamily Small G Proteins: Biology and Mechanisms 2","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/319eb2b655887aed733233c6c7da197486ee920b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123483.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123483/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GTP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of Arf proteins","Arf substrates","Arf small GTP-binding","Arf activation cascades","single Arf protein","important aspect of understanding Arf function","families of G proteins","lipid droplet function","effector complexes","formation of complexes","mechanisms","different GEF","regulated cycle of GTP binding","cellular membranes","hydrolysis","regulators","different cellular locations","membrane traffic","effector interactions","recruitment of cytosolic coat complexes","recent studies","subsequent studies","vesicle formation","plasma membrane signalling pathways","non-vesicular lipid transport","cytoskeleton regulation","eukaryotic cells","organelle structure","roles","GEFs","guanine nucleotide-exchange factors","additional functions","GTPase","positive feedback loops","GAPs","conjunction","unifying theme","lipids","contrast","effectors","New insights","specificity","organism","properties"],"language":"en"},

However, there was little scholarly attention paid to stigma while the outbreak was still active. This chapter explores the effects of stigmatization on the health care services that pregnant women, both with and without Ebola, were able to access and receive during the outbreak. We propose three primary ways in which stigma operated to reduce pregnant women\u2019s access to health care services during the outbreak: (1) Women and their relatives were afraid to go to health facilities for fear of being infected with Ebola while there, i.e., stigmatization of health care facilities; (2) Health care workers frequently died due to their occupational exposure to EVD while caring for others, i.e., they were stigmatized as carriers or transmitters of Ebola; and (3) Pregnant women themselves were refused services at health facilities due to fears that they were infected with Ebola, i.e., the physiological processes of birth, which involve high levels of potential for exposure to bodily fluids, led to health care workers\u2019 stigmatization of these women when they sought services during pregnancy or, particularly, at the time of giving birth. In several of the countries that experienced the worst of the outbreak, women already faced some of the world\u2019s highest rates of pregnancy-related death even prior to the advent of the epidemic. We argue that the high fatality rate for pregnant women with Ebola, the drastic effects of the epidemic on countries\u2019 health care workforce, and the inherent messiness of birth, all coalesced to create heightened discrimination and stigma around seeking care during pregnancy and birth.","publish_time":"2018-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strong, Adrienne E.; Schwartz, David A.","journal":"Pregnant in the Time of Ebola","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7f3c882e6aeaf47445786785641e70570f2bbed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123537.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123537/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["health care services","health facilities","stigmatization of health care facilities","health care workers\u2019 stigmatization","countries\u2019 health care workforce","Ebola virus outbreak","Ebola survivors","transmitters of Ebola","effects of stigmatization","lingering effects of stigma","pregnant women\u2019s access","drastic effects","epidemic","inherent messiness of birth","physiological processes of birth","world\u2019s highest rates of pregnancy","occupational exposure","high levels of potential","high fatality rate","bodily fluids","related death","West Africa","fears","heightened discrimination","little scholarly attention","advent","children","worst","end","relatives","disease","EVD","primary ways","carriers","chapter","time"],"language":"en"},

In addition to syndromic surveillance, a number of informal digital resources have been developed. These systems are based on data collected through media sources such as news reports on the Internet, mailing lists, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds. The role of such systems at all stages of the epidemic remains unclear. Methods A literature review was carried out on informal digital resources for infectious disease surveillance. We examined the source of information, the manner in which they process and disseminate the information, their role in each phase of disease outbreaks, and whether and to what extent these systems are capable of early detection and management of infectious disease epidemics. Results Informal digital resources use similar sources of data for surveillance. However, they use different algorithms to create their output, and cover different geographic areas. In this regard, they complement each other with respect to information completeness. There is evidence in the literature on the systems\u2019 usefulness in communicating information to public health professionals, as well as to the general public during and after previous epidemics. Retrospective studies of some systems have shown a theoretical decrease in the time of epidemic detection compared to conventional surveillance. However, there is no evidence of the ability for real-time detection. Conclusions Currently, there is little prospective evidence that existing informal systems are capable of real-time early detection of disease outbreaks.

However, 30 was associated with cardiac events observed in a normal healthy volunteer (NHV) and an HCV-infected patient that led to the suspension of the development program. Using a Langendorff rabbit heart model, a limited structure-cardiac liability relationship was quickly established that led to the discovery of 1. This compound, which differs from 30 only by changes in the substitution pattern of the P(2)* isoquinoline heterocycle and the addition of a single chlorine atom to the molecular formula, gave a dose-dependent reduction in plasma viral RNA following oral administration to HCV-infected patients without the burden of the cardiac events that had been observed with 30. A small clinical trial of the combination of 1 with the HCV NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir (2) established for the first time that a chronic genotype 1 (GT-1) HCV infection could be cured by therapy with two direct-acting antiviral agents in the absence of exogenous immune-stimulating agents. Development of the combination of 1 and 2 was initially focused on Japan where the patient population is predominantly infected with GT-1b virus, culminating in marketing approval which was granted on July 4, 2014. In order to broaden therapy to include GT-1a infections, a fixed dose triple combination of 1, 2, and the allosteric NS5B inhibitor beclabuvir (3) was developed, approved by the Japanese health authorities for the treatment of HCV GT-1 infection on December 20, 2016 and marketed as Ximency(\u00AE).","publish_time":"2018-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meanwell, Nicholas A.; Rajamani, Ramkumar; Scola, Paul M.; Sun, Li-Qiang","journal":"HCV: The Journey from Discovery to a Cure","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ad1150d2425ae0ac3df072e3bd515960fbfcfd0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123690.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123690/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["HCV infection","HCV-infected patients","treatment of HCV GT","HCV NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir","substituted isoquinoline-based P","cardiac events","plasma viral RNA","dose-dependent reduction","fixed dose triple combination","therapy","potency of carboxylic acid-based prototypes","cyclopropyl-acyl sulfonamide moiety","dose-related reductions","context of tripeptide carboxylic acid-based inhibitors","small clinical trial","cyclopropyl-acyl sulfonamide derivative advanced","clinical trials","oral administration","oral bioavailability","antiviral agents","b virus","isoquinoline heterocycle","optimal element","patient population","development program","discovery of asunaprevir","limited structure-cardiac liability relationship","hepatitis C virus","substituted quinoline isomer","allosteric NS5B inhibitor beclabuvir","molecular formula","single chlorine atom","Langendorff rabbit heart model","pocket","addition","normal healthy volunteer","NS3","NHV","infections","burden","absence of exogenous immune","significant exposure advantage","rats","Japanese health authorities","suspension","interface","well-defined S","fold","specific background","marketing approval","substitution pattern","chronic genotype","protease","changes","time","concept","Optimization","order","BMS","compound","Ximency"],"language":"en"},

The care of the HIV-infected patient was palliative in nature, and the possibility that use of filgrastim (rHuG-CSF) might extend survival in late-stage AIDS patients with severe neutropenia or severe opportunistic infections, or might be a treatment for HIV infection itself, was explored [4]. Subsequently, however, the development of protease inhibitors and the widespread adoption of their use in multidrug regimens of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) revolutionized the care of HIV-infected patients, and the number of patients dying from HIV decreased dramatically [5].","publish_time":"2011-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hemmige, Vagish; Liles, W.

The usefulness of thermography for mass screening has been evaluated in many recent studies; its sensitivity varies from 40 to 89.4% under various circumstances. In this chapter, we perform IRT evaluations for detecting febrile international travelers entering Japan at Nagoya Airport, immediately after the SARS epidemic, from June 2003 to February 2004, and at Naha International Airport from April 2005 to March 2009. The correlation of body surface temperature measured via thermography with the axillary temperature was significant. Through IRT, febrile individuals were detected with good accuracy and the detection accuracy was improved by corroborating surveillance with self-reporting questionnaires. However, there are several limitations associated with the use of IRT for fever screening. For instance, taking antifebrile medications results in rapid modification of the body temperature and directly affects the efficiency of IRT. To solve this unreliability and obtain higher accuracy in mass screening, we have developed a novel infection screening system using multisensor data, i.e., heart and respiration rates are determined by microwave radar in noncontact manner and facial skin temperature is monitored through IRT. The detection accuracy of the system improved, which is notably higher compared to the conventional screening method using only IRT.","publish_time":"2017-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Guanghao; Matsui, Takemi; Kirimoto, Tetsuo; Yao, Yu; Abe, Shigeto","journal":"Application of Infrared to Biomedical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0bfb9b58ac935b99b4913649612189b0d26cba7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123832.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123832/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IRT","Naha International Airport"],"locations":["Japan","Nagoya Airport"],"keyphrases":["IRT evaluations","use of IRT","efficiency of IRT","mass screening of febrile travelers","fever screening","axillary temperature","detection accuracy","higher accuracy","rapid monitoring of body temperature","conventional screening method","good accuracy","novel infection screening system","correlation of body surface temperature","febrile international travelers","facial skin temperature","Nagoya Airport","febrile individuals","Naha International Airport","usefulness of thermography","Infrared thermography","airport quarantine stations","noncontact manner","rapid modification","SARS epidemic","places","microwave radar","multisensor data","years","corroborating surveillance","severe acute respiratory syndrome","antifebrile medications results","Japan","respiration rates","self-reporting questionnaires","heart","outbreak","instance","unreliability","recent studies","sensitivity","valuable tools","limitations","chapter","various circumstances"],"language":"en"},

However, increased permeability caused by host-dependent inflammatory mechanisms or pathogen-induced endothelial injury may lead to uncontrolled protein-rich fluid extravasation, lung edema and finally acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which still carries an unacceptably high mortality rate. This chapter gives an overview of major mechanisms underlying pulmonary endothelial barrier regulation and disruption, focusing on the role of specific cell populations, complement and coagulation systems and mediators including angiopoietins, sphingolipids, adrenomedullin, as well as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the regulation of pulmonary vascular permeability.

In addition to their direct, cytopathic, and tissue-invasive effects, RVs can create an inflammatory environment, autoimmune responses, resulting in acute and chronic rejection, although this relationship remains controversial. A laboratory diagnosis in SOT with respiratory syndrome should be performed with nucleic acid amplification tests on respiratory specimens, mainly nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Treatment options remain limited and consist of supportive care, reduction of immunosuppression, and, if available, antiviral therapy. The use of immunomodulatory agents remains a clinical dilemma. Since treatment options for RVs are limited, maximizing prevention measures against viral infections in SOT is mandatory. The main preventive strategy against influenza remains the administration of yearly inactivated influenza vaccine in all SOT.

In this work, the influence of human mobility is evaluated by analyzing a sequence of correlations of dengue incidence between cities in southeastern Brazil. The methodology initially identifies the cities were the epidemy begins, considered as focus for that epidemic year. The strength of the linear association between all pairs of cities were calculated identifying the cities which have high correlations with the focus-cities. The correlations are also calculated between all pairs considering a time lag of 1, 2 or 3 weeks ahead for all cities except the focus ones. Centred differences of the notification number are used to detect the outbreaks. The tests were made with DATASUS-SINAN data of the state of Rio de Janeiro, from January 2008 to December 2013. Preliminary results indicate that the spread of dengue from one city to another can be characterized by the development of the sequence of shifted correlations. The proposal may be useful to consider control strategies against disease transmission.","publish_time":"2018-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"dos Santos, Bruna C.; Sartori, Larissa M.; Peixoto, Claudia; Bevilacqua, Joyce S.; Oliva, Sergio M.","journal":"Modeling, Dynamics, Optimization and Bioeconomics III","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/344a1674715bed2a1a4eb19b643d54b0cbe5bb99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123889.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123889/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil","Rio de Janeiro"],"keyphrases":["focus-cities","pairs of cities","sequence of correlations","spread of dengue","high correlations","human arboviral disease","sequence of shifted correlations","dengue incidence","influence of human mobility","disease transmission","focus ones","notification number","number of cases","epidemic year","state of Rio","control strategies","Aedes mosquitoes","DATASUS-SINAN data","linear association","southeastern Brazil","major public health problem","risk of infection","Centred differences","time lag","weeks","Climate changes","work","development","Preliminary results","people","tests","Janeiro","strength","proposal","city","epidemy","outbreaks","world","methodology"],"language":"en"},

We discuss challenges and successes in sharing information among these various systems, and opportunities presented by emerging technologies. Systems to support public health surveillance may support traditional passive case-reporting, as enhanced by electronic laboratory reporting and (emerging) direct reporting from electronic health records, and also a wide variety of different surveillance systems. We address syndromic surveillance and other novel approaches including registries for reporting and follow-up of cases of cancer, birth defects, lead poisoning, hepatitis B, etc., and population-based surveys (such as BRFSS or PRAMS). Systems to support epidemiologic investigation of outbreaks and clusters include generic tools such as Excel, SAS, SPSS, and R, and specialized tool-kits for epidemiologic analysis such as Epi-Info. In addition to supporting outbreak investigation, agencies also need systems to collect and manage summary information about outbreaks, investigations, and responses. Systems to support case management, contact tracing, and case-based disease control interventions are often integrated to some degree with surveillance systems.

The methyl-specific labeling is currently used as the most practical technique applicable to large protein complexes and membrane proteins. The standard methyl labeling protocols employ isotope-labeled \u03B1-keto acid precursors, which enable selective observations of the methyl groups of Ile, Leu, and Val residues. More recently, the stereo-specific isotope labeling methods of prochiral methyl groups have become available, using either regio-selectively isotope-labeled precursors or stereo-specifically (13)CH(3)-labeled amino acids. We also focus on the stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) method, which is a breakthrough isotope labeling technology using stereo- and regio-selectively [(2)H, (13)C, (15)N]-labeled amino acids with isotope labeling patterns optimized for NMR studies.

The advancements have significantly contributed towards improvement in the economy of the country as well as food security. In the present competitive era of evolution, the organisms have inculcated a number of new strategies for survival and spread. Therefore, science needs to continuously evolve more sensitive, specific and high-throughput tools to overcome pathogen cleverness to escape from host immune surveillance. For visible or remarkable changes, it is necessary to use full potential of these advanced molecular techniques into current animal health standards and practices. Under \u2018One Health\u2019 concept, the health of animals and humans has to be taken care simultaneously. At present, these advanced molecular diagnostic methods play a significant role in the detection of new and emerging pathogens of livestock. The acquired information also helps to study the interrelationships of pathogens, their hosts and their surroundings. Additionally new vaccines bridging human and animal health development may be discovered. Latest developments in the field of diagnostics and vaccine design through genomics approach have also laid the foundation to enhance the diagnosis and surveillance and in turn helped in the control of infectious diseases. Latest high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms are currently being used for identification and detailed analysis of both disease pathogen and host genomes. The high-throughput data generated using these platforms need to be analysed adopting the bioinformatics and computational genomics that have taken a very high pace nowadays. In the context of animal health, the data analysis may provide some key opportunities for the development of better diagnostic and therapeutic tools for emerging or re-emerging diseases.

When microscopic, it is an asymptomatic and nonspecific reaction of little clinical significance accompanying many pathological processes. When macroscopic and affecting large portions of the lung parenchyma, it manifests by restrictive ventilatory defect and gas exchange impairment leading to dyspnea, cough, hypoxemia, alveolar opacities at chest imaging, and symptoms of systemic inflammation such as fever, malaise, and weight loss. This picture constitutes the clinico-pathological syndrome of organizing pneumonia, which has been recognized and characterized as a distinct entity in the past 30 years. Although the classical features of organizing pneumonia are increasingly familiar to chest physicians, and the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment makes it appear at first sight as an easy problem to resolve, atypical clinical presentations, similarities with other diseases, severe forms, histological variants, side effects of therapy, and relapses can make the management more difficult than initially expected. This chapter will address the classical and less common features of organizing pneumonia, and will provide practical clues to the diagnosis and management of this disorder.","publish_time":"2014-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lazor, Romain","journal":"Orphan Lung Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eeb1c3858b78c7bd966d0064c84e59fc9a575668.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120422.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120422/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classical features of organizing pneumonia","common features of organizing pneumonia","lung parenchyma","clinico-pathological syndrome of organizing pneumonia","lung architecture","management","chest imaging","reparative reaction","chest physicians","pathological processes","nonspecific reaction of little clinical significance","atypical clinical presentations","diseases","gas exchange impairment","fever","histological variants","dyspnea","cough","similarities","hypoxemia","alveolar opacities","restrictive ventilatory defect","symptoms of systemic inflammation","severe forms","distal airspaces","overall preservation","fibroblast proliferation","particular type of inflammatory","malaise","effects of therapy","easy problem","practical clues","relapses","diagnosis","large portions","efficacy of corticosteroid treatment","distinct entity","years","sight","weight loss","picture","disorder","chapter"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we present the development of an alignment-free, digital signal processing based method for pathogenic viral detection named Z-Curve Genomic Cesptral Coefficients (ZCGCC). To evaluate the method, ZCGCC were computed from twenty six pathogenic viral strains extracted from the ViPR corpus. Na\u00EFve Bayesian classifier, which is a popular machine learning method was experimentally trained and validated using the extracted ZCGCC and other alignment-free methods in the literature. Comparative results show that the proposed ZCGCC gives good accuracy (93.0385%) and improved performance to existing alignment-free methods.","publish_time":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adetiba, Emmanuel; Olugbara, Oludayo O.; Taiwo, Tunmike B.; Adebiyi, Marion O.; Badejo, Joke A.; Akanle, Matthew B.; Matthews, Victor O.","journal":"Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cd926ca105e65830de6fbcc99914c050ed14d94.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120486.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120486/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenic viral detection","viral detection accuracy","existing alignment-free methods","pathogenic viral strains","viral diseases","extracted ZCGCC","proposed ZCGCC","Accurate detection of pathogenic viruses","popular machine learning method","good accuracy","digital signal processing","Z-Curve Genomic Cesptral Coefficients","wellbeing","human health","huge threat","improved performance","respect","recent techniques","global scale","ViPR corpus","various setbacks","Na\u00EFve Bayesian classifier","Comparative results","development","literature","codicil","paper"],"language":"en"},

Not long after the introduction of penicillin, Staphylococcus aureus, which can be also transmitted to humans via milk and milk products, began developing penicillin-resistant strains. Therefore, one approach that has been used for the discovery of new antimicrobial agents from natural sources is based on the evaluation of traditional plant extracts. Natural products have played a pivotal role in antibiotic drug innovation and include aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, macrolides, cycloserine, novobiocin, and lipoproteins.

Knowledge of the microbiology of sinusitis is necessary because it impacts the choice of antibiotic therapy. The sinus aspirate is the most reliable source of microbiological data in sinusitis in children. However, sinus aspirates are rarely done in cases of patients with rhinosinusitis; the last time one was done in a child was in 1984. When they are done, sinus aspirate studies of children showed the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis). Unlike sinus aspirates, nasopharyngeal and middle meatal cultures are not reliable in determining the bacteriology of children with acute sinusitis. The observation of an increase in the proportion of cases of acute otitis media caused by H. influenzae may reflect that in acute sinusitis as well. Staphylococcus aureus does not play a significant role in uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis. The microbiology of acute otitis media can be used as a surrogate for that of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. In contrast to bacteria, the contribution of viruses to the pathogenesis of acute bacterial sinusitis has not been studied systematically. The pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis may be related to bacterial biofilms as a stimulant of chronic inflammation.","publish_time":"2013-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeMuri, Gregory P.; Wald, Ellen R.","journal":"Diseases of the Sinuses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edc9e8a66c99820ddd977463612a6ae114325cad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120624.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120624/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute sinusitis","pathogenesis of acute bacterial sinusitis","uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis","microbiology of sinusitis","pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis","microbiology of acute otitis media","sinus aspirates","sinus aspirate studies of children","bacterial biofilms","chronic rhinosinusitis","bacteriology of children","stimulant of chronic inflammation","proportion of cases","Haemophilus influenzae","cases of patients","Moraxella catarrhalis","presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae","reliable source of microbiological data","significant role","middle meatal cultures","contribution of viruses","surrogate","time","increase","infectious etiology","Staphylococcus aureus","choice of antibiotic therapy","contrast","observation","Knowledge"],"language":"en"},

One key consideration in the development of a vaccine is risk-versus-benefit, and in an environment of perceived low risk, the benefit of vaccination may not be recognised. To address this, there has been a move towards the use of subunit-based vaccines, which offer low side-effect profiles but are generally weakly immunogenic. This can be compensated for by the development of effective adjuvants. Nanotechnology offers key attributes in this field through the ability of nanoparticulates to incorporate and protect antigens from rapid degradation, combined with their potential to effectively deliver the antigens to appropriate cells within the immune system. These characteristics can be exploited in the development of new adjuvants. This chapter will outline the applications of nanosystems in vaccine formulations and consider the mechanisms of action behind a range of formulations.","publish_time":"2013-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perrie, Yvonne; Kaur, Randip; Henriksen-Lacey, Malou","journal":"Fundamentals of Pharmaceutical Nanoscience","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5a4741fe5fb889487e0942fc6ccabfb6cfb73b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120629.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120629/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["range of vaccines","range of formulations","based vaccines","vaccine formulations","antigens","key attributes","key consideration","development of effective adjuvants","development of new adjuvants","range of infectious diseases","key line of protection","environment of perceived low risk","benefit of vaccination","low side-effect profiles","field","appropriate cells","applications of nanosystems","mechanisms of action","immune system","ability of nanoparticulates","rapid degradation","potential","use of subunit","Nanotechnology","chapter","characteristics"],"language":"en"},

Steady state conditions are rarely constant but evolutionary adaptation is too slow to adapt to daily threats so a surrogate variation mechanism is necessary. The genome defines the most basic instructions for life so that a molecular biology perspective provides the foundation for understanding resilience. Variations in the expression of RNA offers rapid variation and this book proposes this is the basis of resilience. This book attempts to illuminate mechanisms of resilience beginning with elaborating threats leading to disruption in steady state conditions. Recognition of threats and defense systems are described followed by adaptive changes in gene expression that refine responses. Finally, environmental conditions are discussed that serve to dampen the adaptive response oscillator to disruptive threats at the level of RNA expression. This prologue is intended to acquaint the reader with my background and the genesis of optimism for an idea that the benefit of transcriptome plasticity is resilience. I grew up in several National Parks, remote regions of the United States that are set aside to preserve natural environments. I attended 12 schools by the time I graduated from high school, a fact that forced me to develop personal resilience. My career path as a scientist followed a path from ecologist to pharmacologist to molecular biologist.

This is because the venue of a mass gathering usually does not change year-to-year. As a result, special attention can be given to the public health risks that are introduced by travelers from around the world into these mass gatherings. Travelers can also be infected with diseases that are endemic in the host country and transport the locally acquired infectious diseases to their home environments. Therefore, mass gatherings can be thought of as global-to-local-to-global events because of the initial convergence of global populations and the subsequent divergence of populations throughout the world. This chapter discusses three active areas of geographic research that have emerged from our understanding of disease surveillance at mass gatherings: the role of transportation and population geographies in disease surveillance; the spatial and temporal dimensions of environmental geography in the spread of disease; and the advances in GIScience that provide real-world surveillance and monitoring of disease and injuries at mass gatherings.","publish_time":"2014-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blatt, Amy J.","journal":"Health, Science, and Place","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2133a08590639966929be58d002087e65dccfd00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120711.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120711/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mass gatherings","understanding of disease surveillance","monitoring of disease","spread of disease","infectious diseases","real-world surveillance","global events","travelers","year","initial convergence of global populations","subsequent divergence of populations","role of transportation","temporal dimensions of environmental geography","population geographies","medical community","excellent window of opportunity","advances","GIScience","injuries","active areas of geographic research","chapter","public health risks","host country","home environments","special attention","result","long distances","venue"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, the advent and now common use of biologic immunosuppressive drugs are given to an increasing number of patients prior to transplantation or for treatment of complications arising during the posttransplant period such as graft-versus-host disease, lymphoproliferative disorders, opportunistic malignancies, cancer recurrences, and rejection of solid organ allograft. These and other recent therapeutic advances in transplantation procedures continue to be fraught with prolonged and often unpredictable period of drug-induced immune dysregulation. The emergence and spread of difficult-to-treat opportunistic bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic diseases in transplant population have evolved under the influence of environmental-, host-, disease-, and treatment-specific variance. A diligent diagnostic adjudication is of utmost importance in a population with known proclivity for atypical disease presentation. Inaccurate diagnosis may result in inappropriate and ineffective empiric therapy that may worsen patients\u2019 morbidity and heighten the risk for further complications and death. Advancement in understanding the immunopathogenesis of infectious diseases, hosts\u2019 immunologic vulnerability for infections, emerging molecular diagnostic paradigms, deciphering potential therapeutic impact of immune modulation by existing and new antimicrobial drugs, and active research and development in mitigation strategies to promote immune recovery and immune preservation are encouraging developments in optimizing care for patients in need for lifesaving transplantation procedures.","publish_time":"2018-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Safdar, Amar","journal":"Principles and Practice of Transplant Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5642304a80af00417e92adeab9a009fc17a44a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune recovery","immune preservation","immune dysregulation","population of patients","solid organ transplantation","host disease","lifesaving transplantation procedures","iatrogenically induced immune suppression","potential therapeutic impact of immune modulation","opportunistic malignancies","transplant population","treatment of complications","near-explosive growth of opportunistic infections","increasing number of patients","atypical disease presentation","parasitic diseases","rejection of solid organ allograft","posttransplant period","steady growth","new antimicrobial drugs","myeloablative antineoplastic therapy","immunopathogenesis of infectious diseases","ineffective empiric therapy","diligent diagnostic adjudication","recent therapeutic advances","unpredictable period of drug","treatment-specific variance","emerging molecular diagnostic paradigms","common use of biologic immunosuppressive drugs","hosts\u2019 immunologic vulnerability","active research","cancer recurrences","marrow-derived stem cell","utmost importance","known proclivity","mitigation strategies","lymphoproliferative disorders","blood","care","developments","need","patients\u2019 morbidity","risk","influence of environmental","advent","years","Inaccurate diagnosis","Advancement","death","emergence"],"language":"en"},

This work reviews the recent developments in the automated synthesis of oligosaccharides, the third class of biopolymers. Both glycosyl phosphates and glycosyl trichloroacetimidates have been used successfully in the automated assembly of oligosaccharides employing an octenediol-functionalized polystyrene resin. The product was cleaved either by methanolysis of an ester bond or by olefin cross metathesis. Several biologically important carbohydrates have been synthesized by automation, in a fraction of the time needed to synthesize them by traditional methods. For example, the tumor associated antigens Lewis Y, Le(y)-Le(x), were synthesized by automation.

The risk of a disease pandemic presents an important challenge for social marketing \u2013to this point, health-related social marketing has focused on chronic diseases (such as cancer, asthma, obesity) and their risk factors (such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, and dietary intake). In the communicable disease field, most of the challenges we have addressed have had simple and proven preventive strategies (such as immunisation and the use of condoms). However, emerging pandemic diseases pose new challenges \u2013 notably in the global scale of the threat, the rapid nature of transmission, and (often) the absence of a known cure or vaccine. In this context, people\u2019s quality of life has scope to be shaped by immense physical and social influences. This chapter reports on a comprehensive study undertaken to inform government policy and practice in the event of an avian influenza pandemic \u2013 specifically how to prepare (but not panic) the general public. The research phases included: a media analysis of coverage of a potential pandemic; extensive qualitative formative research; two population CATI surveys; two airport intercept surveys; message development; and message testing. While this research was undertaken in the context of a specific disease, the findings and recommendations are equally relevant to current and future pandemic threats.","publish_time":"2015-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Sandra C.; Iverson, Don; Sutherland, Max; Puplick, Chris; Gold, Julian; Waters, Louise; Berends, Lynda","journal":"Innovations in Social Marketing and Public Health Communication","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5559cd35b3599bbd6d515a384fbcbe3643e1c9f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121060.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["disease pandemic","avian influenza pandemic","emerging pandemic diseases","future pandemic threats","social influences","research phases","specific disease","context","health-related social marketing","communicable disease field","potential pandemics","extensive qualitative formative research","message development","swine flu","new challenges","chronic diseases","physical inactivity","tobacco use","message testing","risk factors","use of condoms","population CATI surveys","airport intercept surveys","bird","point","media analysis of coverage","comprehensive study","government policy","immunisation","recommendations","SARS","important challenge","proven preventive strategies","obesity","world","global scale","cancer","practice","findings","asthma","dietary intake","rapid nature of transmission","absence","known cure","vaccine","chapter reports","people\u2019s quality of life","recent times","Ebola","general public"],"language":"en"},

It is the leading cause of blood product transfusion related death in the USA. The syndrome is defined by hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray in the setting of a blood transfusion and absence of cardiac failure. The exact incidence of TRALI is unknown, but the incidence is higher in the critically ill patient population. Multiple patient and donor related risk factors for TRALI exist, including critically illness, alcohol use, and receiving transfusions with high plasma volumes. Practitioners should have a low index of suspicion for the diagnosis of TRALI, and blood bank reporting is vital to aid in diagnosis and future prevention. Management is primarily supportive care, with supplemental oxygen as the mainstay for therapy. Despite the transient course of TRALI, its morbidity is severe with the majority of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and treatment in the intensive care unit. For patients that survive TRALI, outcomes are promising without residual pulmonary deficits. Prevention strategies over the past 10 years have helped to decrease the incidence of TRALI and have led to increased awareness of this condition in the medical field.","publish_time":"2016-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mannem, Hannah C.; Donahoe, Michael P.","journal":"Hematologic Abnormalities and Acute Lung Syndromes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eaf489950d9d10752a58d8fb0a384054707c7d8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121220.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121220/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TRALI","Practitioners"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of TRALI","blood transfusion","exact incidence of TRALI","transient course of TRALI","life-threatening complication of blood product transfusion","leading cause of blood product transfusion related death","blood bank reporting","donor related risk factors","Multiple patient","supportive care","majority of patients","Prevention strategies","future prevention","hypoxemic respiratory failure","absence of cardiac failure","intensive care unit","ill patient population","bilateral infiltrates","treatment","chest X-ray","setting","mechanical ventilation","transfusions","supplemental oxygen","morbidity","outcomes","acute lung injury","condition","low index of suspicion","years","USA","alcohol use","increased awareness","high plasma volumes","residual pulmonary deficits","mainstay","therapy","syndrome","illness","medical field","Practitioners","Management"],"language":"en"},

So, a highly efficient molecular-based advance detection technique, i.e., loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method, is developed for diagnosis of viral infections by various workers. It is based on amplification of DNA at very low level under isothermal conditions, using a set of four specifically designed primers and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. This technique is found to be superior than most of the molecular techniques like PCR, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR due to its high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity. Major advantage of LAMP method is its cost-effectiveness as it can be done simply by using water bath or dry bath.

These diseases have common features including autoimmune pathogenesis and frequent co morbidity. The treatment of these chronic inflammatory diseases usually requires long-term immunosuppressive therapies with undesirable side effects. The future of chronic inflammatory disease prevention, detection, and treatment will be greatly influenced by the use of more effective biomarkers with enhanced performance. Given the practical issues of collecting tissue samples in inflammatory diseases, biomarkers derived from body fluids have great potential for optimized patient management through the circumvention of the abovementioned limitations. In this chapter, peripheral blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers used in chronic inflammatory conditions are reviewed. In detail, this chapter reviews biomarkers to fore used or emerging to be used in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Those include inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic inflammatory conditions of the liver, biliary tract, pancreas, psoriasis, atopic disease, inflammatory skin diseases, rheumatic diseases, demyelination, and also the chronic inflammatory component of various other diseases in general medicine\u2014including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Development of personalized medicine is closely linked to biomarkers, which may serve as the basis for diagnosis, drug discovery, and monitoring of diseases.","publish_time":"2017-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Katsanos, Aristeidis H.; Kyriakidi, Kalliroi; Karassa, Fotini B.; Politis, Dimitrios; Skamnelos, Alexandros; Christodoulou, Dimitrios K.; Katsanos, Konstantinos H.","journal":"Biomarkers for Endometriosis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8370a2e19f1031426d97aeee8ab1941494726241.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122305.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122305/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chronic inflammatory diseases","inflammatory bowel diseases","chronic inflammatory conditions","inflammatory skin diseases","future of chronic inflammatory disease prevention","chronic inflammatory component of various","rheumatic diseases","monitoring of diseases","renal disease","atopic disease","Crohn\u2019s disease","cardiovascular disease","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","high burden of disease","effective biomarkers","chapter reviews biomarkers","cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers","psoriasis","treatment","general medicine","Development of personalized medicine","body fluids","diabetes","great potential","long-term immunosuppressive therapies","optimized patient management","multiple sclerosis","socioeconomic impact","autoimmune pathogenesis","urine","ulcerative colitis","pancreas","biliary tract","liver","tissue samples","demyelination","circumvention","drug discovery","common features","detection","rheumatoid arthritis","peripheral blood","diagnosis","effects","healthcare cost","practical issues","enhanced performance","basis","morbidity","use","patients","abovementioned limitations","millions of people"],"language":"en"},

In addition, no precise and consistent global baseline syndrome and diagnostic surveillance information exists. An integrated multidisciplinary approach with a combination of sustained pathogen syndrome and diagnostic surveillance, genomics-based, and standardized global analytical networks gathering clinical, epidemiological and genetic data alike would be required to understand the dynamics of foodborne viral infection and to mitigate potential effects of future threats.

However, during the optimization campaign, it was observed that some members of the chemotype underwent a radical dimerization under the assay conditions. This redirected the effort to focus on palindromic molecules, a species subsequently shown to complement the dimeric nature of the NS5A protein. The most challenging aspect of the discovery program was extending antiviral activity to encompass GT-1a virus which was accomplished only after the development of extensive structure-activity relationships. In clinical trials, oral administration of daclatasvir (1) produced a profound effect on viral load with onset that was more rapid than had been seen previously with either NS3 protease or NS5B polymerase inhibitors. A groundbreaking clinical trial that combined daclatasvir (1) with the protease inhibitor asunaprevir (52) established that a chronic HCV infection could be cured with small molecule therapy in the absence of immune stimulation, setting the stage for approval of this regimen for the treatment of GT-1b-infected subjects by the Japanese health authorities on July 4, 2014.","publish_time":"2018-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meanwell, Nicholas A.; Belema, Makonen","journal":"HCV: The Journey from Discovery to a Cure","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a17e650382dfb459b5194dea7615682e8727743.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122418.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122418/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS5A replication inhibitor daclatasvir","oral administration of daclatasvir","protease inhibitor asunaprevir","discovery program","NS5A protein","treatment of GT","antiviral activity","NS3 protease","clinical trials","hepatitis C virus","chronic HCV infection","groundbreaking clinical trial","development of extensive structure-activity relationships","b-infected subjects","onset","absence of immune stimulation","small molecule therapy","radical dimerization","viral load","profound effect","Japanese health authorities","approval","stage","regimen","NS5B polymerase inhibitors","origins","dimeric nature","palindromic molecules","species","phenotypic screening lead","chemotype","assay conditions","challenging aspect","effort","members","optimization campaign"],"language":"en"},

This is associated with increased risk of acquiring fungal opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients which account for high morbidity and mortality rates, if left untreated. The conventional antifungal drugs to treat fungal diseases (mycoses) are increasingly becoming inadequate due to observed varied susceptibility of fungi and their recurrent resistance. RNA interference (RNAi), sequence-specific gene silencing, is emerging as a promising new therapeutic approach. This chapter discusses various aspects of RNAi, viz., the fundamental RNAi machinery present in fungi, in silico siRNA features, designing guidelines and tools, siRNA delivery, and validation of gene knockdown for therapeutics against mycoses. Target gene identification is a crucial step in designing of gene-specific siRNA in addition to efficient delivery strategies to bring about effective inhibition of fungi. Subsequently, designed siRNA can be delivered effectively in vitro either by soaking fungi with siRNA or by transforming inverted repeat transgene containing plasmid into fungi, which ultimately generates siRNA(s). Finally, fungal inhibition can be verified at the RNA and protein levels by blotting techniques, fluorescence imaging, and biochemical assays. Despite challenges, several such in vitro studies have spawned optimism around RNAi as a revolutionary new class of therapeutics against mycoses. But, pharmacokinetic parameters need to be evaluated from in vivo studies and clinical trials to recognize RNAi as a novel treatment approach for mycoses.","publish_time":"2017-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jain, Chakresh Kumar; Wadhwa, Gulshan","journal":"Current trends in Bioinformatics: An Insight","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30329aef13ea7e68d22e4ed8e6de31d8af6cb3f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122507.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["siRNA delivery","gene-specific siRNA","mycoses","designed siRNA","soaking fungi","silico siRNA features","effective inhibition of fungi","fungal inhibition","various aspects of RNAi","varied susceptibility of fungi","fundamental RNAi machinery present","validation of gene knockdown","sequence-specific gene silencing","Target gene identification","fungal diseases","studies","fungal opportunistic infections","immunocompromised patients","increased risk","revolutionary new class of therapeutics","promising new therapeutic approach","RNA interference","efficient delivery strategies","number of immunocompromised population","novel treatment approach","increased use of potent immunosuppression therapies","account","techniques","high morbidity","guidelines","tools","addition","fluorescence imaging","crucial step","inverted repeat transgene","mortality rates","protein levels","conventional antifungal drugs","plasmid","optimism","biochemical assays","steady rise","recurrent resistance","clinical trials","chapter","pharmacokinetic parameters","challenges"],"language":"en"},

In addition, ALI susceptibility and severity are also affected by ethnicity as evidenced by the higher mortality rates observed in African-American ALI patients compared with other ethnic groups in the USA. Moreover, marked differences in strain-specific ALI responses to inflammatory and injurious agents are observed in preclinical animal models. Together, these observations strongly indicate genetic components to be involved in the pathogenesis of ALI. The identification of genes contributing to ALI would potentially provide a better understanding of ALI pathobiology, yield novel biomarkers, identify individuals or populations at risk, and prove useful for the development of novel and individualized therapies. Genome-wide searches in animal models have identified a number of quantitative trait loci that associate with ALI susceptibility.

Experiments performed \u201Cin vitro\u201D (human lymphocytes exposed to endotoxins) and \u201Cin vivo\u201D (old mice or young mice fed with low zinc dietary intake) show that zinc is important for immune response both innate and adoptive. Selenium provokes zinc release by Metallothioneins (MT), via reduction of glutathione peroxidase. This fact is crucial in ageing because high MT may be unable to release zinc with subsequent low intracellular free zinc ion availability for immune response. Taking into account the existence of zinc transporters (ZnT and ZIP family) for cellular zinc efflux and influx, respectively, the association between ZnT and MT is important in maintaining satisfactory intracellular zinc homeostasis in ageing. Improved immune performance occur in elderly after physiological zinc supplementation, which also induces prolonged survival in old, nude and neonatal thymectomized mice.

This chapter will provide an overview of the viruses known and postulated to be potential sources of foodborne infection at the retail level, their routes of spread, current regulatory mechanisms in place to prevent infection, as well as explore both proven and new methods for control.","publish_time":"2014-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tetro, Jason","journal":"Retail Food Safety","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12409ddd4f307e690e560be41cc0ac8bbf99e8c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122658/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of viruses","ability of viruses","retail level","options","control","emergence of novel viruses","potential sources of foodborne infection","greater potential","foodborne outbreaks","disinfection methods","new methods","routes of spread","current regulatory mechanisms","significant threat","comparison","place","mortality","bacterial counterparts","global public health","recent advancements","morbidity","environment","future","overview","chapter"],"language":"en"},

The crucial pathophysiology is an excessive hypoxia-mediated rise in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) or hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) leading to increased microvascular hydrostatic pressures despite normal left atrial pressure. The resultant hydrostatic stress can cause both dynamic changes in the permeability of the alveolar capillary barrier and mechanical damage leading to leakage of large proteins and erythrocytes into the alveolar space in the absence of inflammation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and pulmonary artery (PA) and microvascular pressure measurements in humans confirm that high capillary pressure induces a high-permeability non-inflammatory-type lung edema; a concept termed \u201Ccapillary stress failure.\u201D Measurements of endothelin and nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled air, NO metabolites in BAL fluid, and NO-dependent endothelial function in the systemic circulation all point to reduced NO availability and increased endothelin in hypoxia as a major cause of the excessive hypoxic PA pressure rise in HAPE-susceptible individuals. Other hypoxia-dependent differences in ventilatory control, sympathetic nervous system activation, endothelial function, and alveolar epithelial sodium and water reabsorption likely contribute additionally to the phenotype of HAPE susceptibility. Recent studies using magnetic resonance imaging in humans strongly suggest nonuniform regional hypoxic arteriolar vasoconstriction as an explanation for how HPV occurring predominantly at the arteriolar level can cause leakage. This compelling but not yet fully proven mechanism predicts that in areas of high blood flow due to lesser vasoconstriction edema will develop owing to pressures that exceed the structural and dynamic capacity of the alveolar capillary barrier to maintain normal alveolar fluid balance. Numerous strategies aimed at lowering HPV and possibly enhancing active alveolar fluid reabsorption are effective in preventing and treating HAPE. Much has been learned about HAPE in the past four decades such that what was once a mysterious alpine malady is now a well-characterized and preventable lung disease. This chapter will relate the history, pathophysiology, and treatment of HAPE, using it not only to illuminate the condition, but also for the broader lessons it offers in understanding pulmonary vascular regulation and lung fluid balance.","publish_time":"2010-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Swenson, Erik R.","journal":"Textbook of Pulmonary Vascular Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02160d77412b8d730f1c5338b62e88b492a10708.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122766.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PVR","HAPE","HPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alveolar capillary barrier","hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction","high capillary pressure","High-altitude pulmonary edema","alveolar space","normal alveolar fluid balance","pulmonary artery","treatment of HAPE","active alveolar fluid reabsorption","pulmonary vascular resistance","pulmonary vascular regulation","uncommon form of pulmonary edema","BAL fluid","HPV","lung fluid balance","HAPE-susceptible individuals","excessive hypoxic PA pressure","alveolar epithelial sodium","microvascular pressure measurements","lesser vasoconstriction edema","phenotype of HAPE susceptibility","capillary stress failure","high-permeability non-inflammatory-type lung edema","humans","normal left atrial pressure","dependent endothelial function","increased microvascular hydrostatic pressures","nonuniform regional hypoxic arteriolar vasoconstriction","hypoxia-dependent differences","excessive hypoxia-mediated rise","increased endothelin","Measurements of endothelin","major cause","preventable lung disease","resultant hydrostatic stress","areas of high blood flow","dynamic capacity","dynamic changes","water reabsorption","healthy individuals","arteriolar level","crucial pathophysiology","leakage of large proteins","ventilatory control","sympathetic nervous system activation","PVR","mechanical damage","magnetic resonance imaging","concept","exhaled air","erythrocytes","explanation","Recent studies","nitric oxide","systemic circulation","days of arrival","metabolites","availability","mysterious alpine malady","proven mechanism","Bronchoalveolar lavage","history","absence of inflammation","broader lessons","altitudes","chapter","Numerous strategies","decades","condition"],"language":"en"},

The Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and its homologs in human and mouse represent an important C-type lectin family. DC-SIGN contains a lectin domain that recognizes in a Ca(2\u002B)-dependent manner carbohydrates such as mannose-containing structures present on glycoproteins such as ICAM-2 and ICAM-3. DC-SIGN is a prototype C-type lectin organized in microdomains, which have their role as pathogen recognition receptors in sensing microbes. Although the integrin LFA-1 is a counter-receptor for both ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 on DC, DC-SIGN is the high affinity adhesion receptor for ICAM-2/-3. While cell\u2013cell contact is a primary function of selectins, collectins are specialized in recognition of pathogens. Interestingly, DC-SIGN is a cell adhesion receptor as well as a pathogen recognition receptor. As adhesion receptor, DC-SIGN mediates the contact between dendritic cells (DCs) and T lymphocytes, by binding to ICAM-3, and mediates rolling of DCs on endothelium, by interacting with ICAM-2. As pathogen receptor, DC-SIGN recognizes a variety of microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and several parasites (Cambi et al. 2005). The natural ligands of DC-SIGN consist of mannose oligosaccharides or fucose-containing Lewis-type determinants. In this chapter, we shall focus on the structure and functions of DC-SIGN and related CTLDs in the recognition of pathogens, the molecular and structural determinants that regulate the interaction with pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The heterogeneity of carbohydrate residues exposed on cellular proteins and pathogens regulates specific binding of DC-expressed C-type lectins that contribute to the diversity of immune responses created by DCs (van Kooyk et al. 2003a; Cambi et al. 2005).","publish_time":"2012-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Rajesh K.; Gupta, G.

Physiologically, growth signals are transient and entirely depend on the engagement of a growth factor receptor by its cognate ligand. Upon termination of this interaction, the growth signal ceases.

Hunting is particularly prevalent among the large-bodied fruit bats of the Old World tropics, where half (50 %, 92/183) the extant species in the family Pteropodidae are hunted. Pteropodids that are hunted are six times more likely to be Red Listed as threatened: 66 % of species in IUCN threatened categories (CR, EN, VU, NT), compared to 11 % of species in the \u2018Least Concern\u2019 (LC) category. However, there still appears to be an information gap at the international level. One third of the hunted species on the Red List are not considered threatened by that hunting, and nearly a quarter of the bat species included in this review are not listed as hunted in IUCN Red List species accounts. This review has resulted in a comprehensive list of hunted bats that doubles the number of species known from either the IUCN Red List species accounts or a questionnaire circulated in 2004. More research is needed on the impacts of unregulated hunting, as well as on the sustainability of regulated hunting programs. In the absence of population size and growth data, legislators and managers should be precautionary in their attitude towards hunting. Roost site protection should be a priority as it is both logistically simpler than patrolling bat foraging grounds and reduces the comparatively larger scale mortality and stress that hunting at the roost can cause. Education and awareness campaigns within local communities should demonstrate how bats are a limited resource and emphasize characteristics (nocturnal, slow reproducing and colonial) that make them particularly vulnerable to hunting pressure.","publish_time":"2015-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mildenstein, Tammy; Tanshi, Iroro; Racey, Paul A.","journal":"Bats in the Anthropocene: Conservation of Bats in a Changing World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/675c916793f79ed53450dd6ad384719dffe52ac2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123159.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123159/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IUCN Red List","IUCN"],"locations":["Asia","South America"],"keyphrases":["hunted species","species of bats","Bat hunting","extant species","number of species","world\u2019s bat species","IUCN Red List species accounts","comprehensive list of hunted bats","impacts of unregulated hunting","sustainability of regulated hunting programs","bat foraging grounds","review","large-bodied fruit bats","Roost site protection","growth data","legislators","CR","Old World tropics","lesser extent","characteristics","managers","local communities","larger scale mortality","stress","categories","consumption","bushmeat","Africa","absence of population size","colonial","South America","slow reproducing","Education","awareness campaigns","VU","priority","limited resource","medicine","Asia","times","questionnaire","islands of Oceania","information gap","international level","half","attitude","Concern","family Pteropodidae","LC","category","Pteropodids","quarter","pressure","research"],"language":"en"},

Scientific evidence has associated harmful health effects to indoor air hazards recognizing the existence of a vital concern in public health sector. Thus the assessment of human exposure to biological aerosols and droplets indoor became an imperative requirement of investigation. Environmental bioburden assessment of viruses relies in both culture-dependent approaches that comprise classical methodologies, still prominent and vital in the field of modern biotechnology, and culture-independent approaches based on nucleic acid amplification techniques, which are considered the gold standard in clinical virology. The main factor influencing indoor microbiology is the human being and their activities. Indoor environments to be considered are those regularly occupied by humans: residences, offices, schools, industrial buildings, health care facilities, farming activities and other settings occupied all the time, or in which occupant density is high. It\u2019s well known that approximately 60% of total human respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are acquired indoor, since viruses have a rapid spread in the community and can be transmitted easily, especially in crowded and poorly ventilated environments, causing high morbidity and decline in quality of life and productivity. Studies have shown that respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza and parainfluenza virus, and human enterovirus infections may be associated with virus-induced asthma, leading to diseases such as pneumonia. Gastroenteritis infectious (about 30\u00B140% of cases) is attributable to viruses. Rotavirus, Astrovirus, Norwalk-like viruses and other caliciviruses are responsible for 48% of all reported outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease. Safe working conditions are essential for healthy living, that\u2019s why the programmes conceived as a result of strategic and preventive policy maintenance, in refrigeration and ventilation systems, are the determining factor for the control of biological pollutants. Moreover, the development of highly sensitive and specific detection and identification methodologies with capacity to be used in diverse applications, such as diagnosis, public health risk assessment, research and for the implementation of preventive measures and protocols are imperative.","publish_time":"2017-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ribeiro, Edna; Leit\u00E3o, C\u00E9u; Cristovam, Elisabete; Dias, Ana","journal":"Exposure to Microbiological Agents in Indoor and Occupational Environments","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dca4d35dd3164ec83b0691989eb49b7f343599ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121309.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121309/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human history viruses","Indoor environments","droplets indoor","assessment of human exposure","indoor microbiology","public health risk assessment","Environmental bioburden assessment of viruses","public health sector","human enterovirus infections","health care facilities","harmful health effects","indoor air hazards","parainfluenza virus","respiratory syncytial virus","culture-independent approaches","culture-dependent approaches","virus-induced asthma","vital concern","biological aerosols","classical methodologies","gastrointestinal infections","identification methodologies","determining factor","pandemic potential","main factor","pandemic dimensions","farming activities","high morbidity","ventilated environments","rapid spread","Gastroenteritis infectious","preventive policy maintenance","implementation of preventive measures","control of biological pollutants","imperative requirement of investigation","reported outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease","schools","industrial buildings","metapneumovirus","capacity","specific detection","rhinovirus","existence","diagnosis","research","healthy living","ventilation systems","field of modern biotechnology","nucleic acid amplification techniques","offices","result of strategic","refrigeration","occurrence","Safe working conditions","programmes","residences","settings","protocols","Scientific evidence","Norwalk","threat","gold standard","quality of life","diverse applications","diseases","clinical virology","time","humans","development","occupant density","Astrovirus","caliciviruses","Studies","productivity","Rotavirus","community","cases","pneumonia","people"],"language":"en"},

Neutropenia predisposes patients to fungal, bacterial and viral infections. Antibacterial antifungal and antiviral prophylaxis have caused a significant reduction in some of these infections. There are two main types of cutaneous infections : primary cutaneous infections and cutaneous manifestations of a disseminated infection. In the latter, skin lesions may be the window to disseminated bloodstream infection and the first and only evidence of a disseminated life threatening infection. The diagnosis may be at your fingertips; therefore a thorough skin exam is the clue. However, it\u2019s also important to know the characteristic lesions associated with different infections. It will help expedite diagnosis so appropriate treatment is initiated promptly in neutropenic patients, which can be lifesaving. In a retrospective study of 43 neutropenic febrile patients with cutaneous lesions, fungal infections were the most frequent, and nodular lesions on the lower extremities were the most prevalent (Naorungroj and Aiempanakit, J Am Acad Dermatol 74:AB166, 2016). Skin biopsy for pathological study and culture remains the gold standard and should be obtained early to confirm the suspected diagnosis. In these immunocompromised patients the inflammatory response is altered by either the primary disease or its treatment. Therefore, routine pathogens may present in an atypical fashion, with diminished or absent induration, erythema, or pustulation in response to bacterial resulting cutaneous infection without typical cellulitis (Urabe, Clin Infect Dis 39:S53\u2013S55, 2004). Skin lesions are evaluated not only by morphology, but also in the context of the clinical setting and biopsy result. The skin biopsy is inexpensive, relatively noninvasive and without contraindication, and may avoid the need for more invasive procedures such an open lung biopsy (Grossman, et al., Cutaneous manifestations of infection in the immunocompromised host. Springer Science\u002BBusiness Media, LLC, New York, 2012). In addition to antimicrobial therapy, surgery should not be postponed in the face of progressive skin and soft tissue infection in this population (Brzozowski and Ross, J Hand Surg Br 22:679\u2013680, 1997).","publish_time":"2019-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rihana, Nancy; Sampson, Mindy","journal":"Infections in Neutropenic Cancer Patients","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4ff00e838202c5df4dbb1689ea7ebb50c2fcf16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121505.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121505/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Springer Science\u002BBusiness Media"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cutaneous lesions","skin lesions","primary cutaneous infections","Cutaneous manifestations of infection","Skin biopsy","fungal infections","disseminated infection","bacterial resulting cutaneous infection","main types of cutaneous infections","viral infections","different infections","immunocompromised patients","neutropenic patients","bloodstream infection","nodular lesions","characteristic lesions","disseminated life threatening infection","soft tissue infection","neutropenic febrile patients","face of progressive skin","thorough skin exam","biopsy result","open lung biopsy","immunocompromised host","suspected diagnosis","pathological study","retrospective study","inflammatory response","primary disease","appropriate treatment","J Hand Surg Br","Brzozowski","pustulation","typical cellulitis","Business Media","LLC","population","culture","absent induration","antiviral prophylaxis","atypical fashion","Aiempanakit","Naorungroj","erythema","invasive procedures","Urabe","Grossman","evidence","Acad Dermatol","lower extremities","Springer Science","New York","context","clinical setting","significant reduction","fingertips","window","gold standard","addition","antimicrobial therapy","surgery","Antibacterial antifungal","contraindication","need","AB166","clue","Neutropenia","routine pathogens","S53","morphology","lifesaving","S55"],"language":"en"},

A bloody civil war in which an estimated 1 million people were killed ravaged the country from 1967 to 1970. Interethnic and intra-communal conflicts have also shaken the foundations of the nation since 1960 when colonial rule ended. Other violent conflicts that have plagued the country are religious conflicts in Kano, Bauchi, Kaduna, Kafanchan, Zaria, Jos, Maiduguri, and many other places. Blood-letting in the name of religion in these and other places in Nigeria has left thousands dead and wounded. Destruction of property in the course of religious violence in Nigeria has also wreaked economic calamity on the country. For instance, wanton destruction of property during the Maitatsene religious uprising in Kano from 1980 to 1985 resulted in the loss of lives and of millions of dollars. Clashes between members of the militant Shi\u2019ite religious sect and the Nigerian army in 2016 led to the demolition of an entire neighborhood in Zaria city Nigeria\u2019s latest bout of violence emanates from a deadly terrorist group, Boko Haram.

Initially, Boko Haram could not be contained by Nigerian security forces. It captured and held on to 14 local government districts and it constantly churned out online propaganda about its invisibility and its certainty that it would impose a radical Islamic government over the entire country. This chapter provides a critical analysis of Boko Haram\u2019s propaganda. It examines the group\u2019s core messages and the stylistic techniques used in delivering them. The chapter notes that Boko Haram deliberately used crude, unvanished imagery to reinforce the brutality of its actions in suicide bombings, drive-by shootings, and direct attacks against military barracks, markets, mosques, and churches. We contend that the effectiveness of Boko Haram\u2019s propaganda began to decline as it suffered military defeats by Nigerian forces.","publish_time":"2017-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogbondah, Chris Wolumati; Agbese, Pita Ogaba","journal":"The Palgrave Handbook of Media and Communication Research in Africa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5175c6e2d710af90f7eb2495cf7e24bf570fec92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121539.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121539/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Boko Haram"],"locations":["Zaria","Nigeria","Kano"],"keyphrases":["religious conflicts","entire country","violent conflicts","people","effectiveness of Boko Haram\u2019s propaganda","Nigerian forces","critical analysis of Boko Haram\u2019s propaganda","course of religious violence","Maitatsene religious uprising","Kano","Nigerian army","intra-communal conflicts","online propaganda","Post-colonial Nigeria","Nigerian security forces","places","militant Shi\u2019ite religious sect","wanton destruction of property","Zaria city Nigeria\u2019s latest bout of violence","entire neighborhood","military barracks","military defeats","chapter notes","colonial rule","radical Islamic government","local government districts","devastation of Nigeria\u2019s northeast region","markets","shootings","Kafanchan","Kaduna","Bauchi","direct attacks","deadly terrorist group","brutality","suicide bombings","drive","members","crude","unvanished imagery","group\u2019s core messages","stylistic techniques","actions","mosques","Jos","Maiduguri","demolition","economic calamity","bloody civil war","Clashes","nation","invisibility","certainty","foundations","instance","thousands dead","loss of lives","millions of dollars","churches","religion"],"language":"en"},

Combating such global diseases requires in-depth knowledge of their epidemiology. The only practical method for discovering global epidemiological knowledge and identifying prophylactic strategies is simulation. However, several interrelated factors, including increasing model complexity, stochastic nature of diseases, and short analysis timeframes render exhaustive analysis an infeasible task. An effective approach to alleviate the aforementioned issues and enable efficient epidemiological analysis is to manually steer bio-simulations to scenarios of interest. Selective steering preserves causality, inter-dependencies, and stochastic characteristics in the model better than \u201Cseeding\u201D, i.e., manually setting simulation state. Accordingly, we have developed a novel Eco-modeling and bio-simulation environment called SEARUMS. The bio-simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS permits a human-in-the-loop to steer the simulation to scenarios of interest so that epidemics can be effectively modeled and analyzed. This article discusses mathematical principles underlying SEARUMS along with its software architecture and design. In addition, the article also presents the bio-simulations and multi-faceted case studies conducted using SEARUMS to elucidate its ability to forecast timelines, epicenters, and socio-economic impacts of epidemics. Currently, the primary emphasis of SEARUMS is to ease global epidemiological analysis of avian influenza.

Major food safety events have been significantly affected by the lack of collaboration between the animal health, the food control, and the human health sector. One Health formulates clearly both the need for, and the benefit of cross-sectoral collaboration.

Public hospitals are mostly, but not always, under the supervision of the Health Ministry. There are a certain number of other governing bodies that are directly involved in the management of hospitals. A cross-ministry group was set up in 2006 to facilitate the implementation of hospital reforms. Apart from the organizational structure, the funding of hospitals and its evolution is studied. Between 1979 and 1991, the government introduced a co-payment system in healthcare establishments. In 1992, the Ministry of Health officially granted greater autonomy to public hospitals. They were authorized to deliver paid services and to make profits, but were made responsible for their losses and debts. By 2003, central government funding had fallen to 8% of the hospital budget. As a result, public hospitals in China behave very similarly to for-profit firms, while being governed as any traditional public structure. The next step is the current experiment of a Diagnostics Related Group-based payment in China. Along with the financial autonomy of public hospitals, different reforms have been directed at developing private hospitals, even though many obstacles still remain.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milcent, Carine","journal":"Healthcare Reform in China","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eca69ae519d4195fc87d1ec8cf39c1835f17f661.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121798.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121798/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Ministry"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["funding of hospitals","private hospitals","management of hospitals","financial autonomy of public hospitals","traditional public structure","Health Ministry","Ministry of Health","China","cross-ministry group","implementation of hospital reforms","supervision","hospital ownership","hospital budget","central government funding","greater autonomy","different reforms","organizational structure","Diagnostics Related Group-based payment","current experiment","co-payment system","healthcare establishments","profits","certain number","governing bodies","chapter","result","paid services","losses","debts","step","for-profit firms","obstacles","evolution"],"language":"en"},

While risk factors such as lifestyle patterns, genetic traits, blood lipid levels, and diabetes can contribute to its development, advancing age remains the most determinant predictor of cardiac disease. Several parameters of left ventricular function may be affected with aging, including increased duration of systole, decreased sympathetic stimulation, and increased left ventricle ejection time, while compliance decreases. In addition, changes in cardiac phenotype with diastolic dysfunction, reduced contractility, left ventricular hypertrophy, and HF, all increase in incidence with age. Given the limited capacity that the heart has for regeneration, reversing or slowing the progression of these abnormalities poses a major challenge.

Methods: This chapter will review previous literature and newer results concerning the possible roles of CMV, other herpesviruses, community-acquired respiratory viruses, bacteria (including Pseudomonas, other gram-negative, gram-positive, and atypical organisms), and fungi, including colonization as well as invasive infection. Results: The text reviews and evaluates the body of literature supporting a role for these infectious agents as risk factors for BOS and time to BOS. Changing patterns of infection over time are taken into account, and studies that have shown an association between BOS (or lack thereof) and CMV are reviewed. Strategies for prevention or early treatment of infections are discussed as potential means of preserving allograft function long term. Immunizations, stringent infection-control practices, and antimicrobial treatment including newer therapies will be discussed. Conclusion: In addition to the classic literature that has focused on CMV, an expanding spectrum of infectious organisms has been implicated as possible risk factors for BOS. Increasing knowledge of the impact of long-term antiviral suppression, prophylaxis, and outcomes of early therapy will help guide future recipient management.","publish_time":"2013-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Avery, Robin K.","journal":"Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome in Lung Transplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a32d48a1322181b7217d8328fe6d90d80fc070f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121969.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121969/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BOS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BOS","Infectious agents","possible roles of CMV","possible risk factors","early treatment of infections","newer results","role of infections","previous literature","body of literature","classic literature","time","invasive infection","patterns of infection","expanding spectrum of infectious organisms","antimicrobial treatment","potential means","stringent infection-control practices","atypical organisms","newer therapies","potential triggers","outcomes of early therapy","allograft function long term","prophylaxis","herpesviruses","impact of long-term antiviral suppression","Pseudomonas","bacteria","respiratory viruses","community","exact magnitude","Immunizations","mechanisms","chapter","prevention","cytomegalovirus","future recipient management","text reviews","knowledge","fungi","colonization","addition","Strategies","association","account","Background","lack","area of active research","studies","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

They account for approximately 4 million deaths annually including children and adults and provide a greater disease burden than HIV and malaria. Among the common respiratory diseases, tuberculosis, influenza, and pneumonia are very common and can be life threatening if not treated properly. The causative agent of tuberculosis is the slow-growing bacilli Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while the causative agent of influenza is a segmented genome RNA virus. Pneumonia can be caused by a number of different microorganisms like bacteria, virus, and mycoplasma. In case of the entry of a pathogen in our body, the immune system gets activated, and the phagocytic cells try to eliminate it by generating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) inside the phagosome. These reactive species or respiratory bursts are sufficient to eliminate most of the pathogens, except a few. M. tuberculosis is one such microorganism that has evolved mechanisms to escape this respiratory burst-mediated killing and thus survive and grow inside the macrophages. Infection with M. tuberculosis leads to the destruction of macrophages and release of cytokines, which lead to prolonged immune activation and oxidative stress. In some cases, the bacilli remain dormant inside macrophages for a long time. Flu viruses infect the epithelial cells present in respiratory tract, and the infection site is dependent on the hemagglutinin protein present on their capsid. Destruction of epithelial cells promotes secretion of mucus and activation of immune system leading to the oxidative damage. Community-acquired pneumonia is more serious and difficult to treat. In all these infections, ROS/RNS are developed as a defense mechanism against the pathogen. Persistence of the pathogen for a long time would lead to the uncontrolled production of ROS/RNS which will lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage to the host. Administration of antioxidants along with conventional treatments can be useful in the elimination of the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.","publish_time":"2019-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarkar, Kasturi; Sil, Parames C.","journal":"Oxidative Stress in Lung Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fdb9dc549365f6886433fc9ee36cb5c7c0016cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122037.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","RNS","ROS/RNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNS","causative agent of tuberculosis","reactive species","respiratory bursts","common respiratory diseases","pneumonia","reactive oxygen","nitrogen species","oxidative stress","Lower respiratory tract infections","oxidative damage","destruction of macrophages","activation of immune system","Destruction of epithelial cells","dormant inside macrophages","causative agent of influenza","prolonged immune activation","slow-growing bacilli Mycobacterium tuberculosis","long time","phagocytic cells","deaths","account","uncontrolled production of ROS","infection site","tissue damage","infectious diseases","hemagglutinin protein present","segmented genome RNA virus","secretion of mucus","greater disease burden","bacteria","adults","elimination","body","conventional treatments","HIV","malaria","number of different microorganisms","World Health Organization","release of cytokines","Administration of antioxidants","children","capsid","entry","host","mechanisms","Flu viruses","cases","defense mechanism","mycoplasma","Community","Persistence","phagosome","pathogens","life"],"language":"en"},

These facets may permit novel methods to emerge to supplement, refine, or replace the routine methods. We have suggested a framework for risk assessment to assure biosafety in vaccines and suggested quantitative modeling to help crystallize thinking about the place of testing, either routine or novel, in this assurance. We assert that testing for adventitious agents should not be the sole basis on which product biosafety is assured. Appropriate sourcing and quality control of raw and starting materials, adherence to principles of Good Manufacturing Practices, including environmental and personnel monitoring and process validation, and finally, testing as verification are the package needed for maximal assurance of biosafety. Thus, a pathway forward to a new paradigm for adventitious agent testing exists in which detection of a broader array of potential adventitious agents might be included in the testing, with adequate sensitivity to provide the needed assurance of verification that there has been no catastrophic breach, in the context of the overall process, design, and adherence to cGMP. Furthermore, it is our hope that we may be able to implement the 3 Rs policy to reduce, replace, and/or refine the use of animals in product safety testing, at the same time that we provide greater assurance of the biosafety of vaccines.","publish_time":"2014-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheets, Rebecca L.; Duncan, Paul A.","journal":"Vaccine Analysis: Strategies, Principles, and Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1beb6437e007937498b367e45bedaa62e82ff730.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adventitious agent testing","place of testing","product safety testing","biosafety of vaccines","product biosafety","maximal assurance of biosafety","novel methods","routine methods","needed assurance of verification","detection principles","greater assurance","adherence","broader array of potential adventitious agents","routine tests","emerging methods","reviews","principles of Good Manufacturing Practices","process validation","overall process","materials","personnel monitoring","quality control of raw","context","design","new paradigm","package","sole basis","Appropriate sourcing","thinking","risk assessment","quantitative modeling","use of animals","time","adequate sensitivity","framework","catastrophic breach","Rs policy","pathway","cGMP","summary","chapter","facets","supplement","hope"],"language":"en"},

The history of science challenges its rationality in a different way in the pessimistic induction, where failures of our predecessors to come up with true theories about unobservable entities is taken by many to threaten the rationality of confidence in our own theories. The first problem arises from a perception of too much discontinuity, the second from an unfortunate kind of continuity, in the track record of science. I argue that both problems are only apparent, and due to under-description of the history. The continuing appeal of the pessimistic induction in particular is encouraged by narrow focus on a notion of method that Kuhn was eager to resist.","publish_time":"2015-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roush, Sherrilyn","journal":"Kuhn\u0026#x02019;s Structure of Scientific Revolutions - 50 Years On","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea42a6cb9fe1fc6c39dda6c941d305f4e9038cb4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122058.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122058/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kuhn"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rationality of science","pessimistic induction","history of science challenges","rationality of confidence","track record of science","true theories","different way","notion of method","narrow focus","paradigm shifts","predecessors","Kuhn\u2019s claim","continuing appeal","unfortunate kind of continuity","under-description","unobservable entities","failures","discontinuity","philosophers","perception","neutral arbiter","change","problems","theory"],"language":"en"},

A plethora of chemical chitosan derivatives have been synthesized yielding improved materials with suggested or effective applications in water treatment, biosensor engineering, agriculture, food processing and storage, textile additives, cosmetics fabrication, and in veterinary and human medicine.

Current preventive strategies are not sufficient at all, and available therapeutic drugs are very limited. Indeed, genetic variations of viruses can impair the efficacy of antiviral compounds by the apparition of resistance. Moreover, current delay needed for de novo development of drugs does not allow a rapid response in case of important epidemic or pandemic events. In this context, new therapeutic approaches are necessary. An innovative concept is to repurpose already marketed compounds that can reverse the host cellular transcriptomic response to the infection. By targeting the host, these molecules exhibit a broad-spectrum activity and are potentially effective even against new emergent strains.

Molecular methods such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) rapidly are being developed and introduced in the clinical laboratory setting. Indeed, every section of the clinical microbiology laboratory, including bacteriology, mycology, mycobacteriology, parasitology, and virology, have benefited from these advanced techniques.

Time is often limited, the patient\u2019s condition may be critical, and a failed airway has the potential for significant morbidity or death. Chest radiography (CXR) is useful in diagnosing and evaluating the progression of atelectasis, aspiration, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and pleural fluid collections. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) is an excellent complementary diagnostic tool in emergency diagnosis. For patients who can tolerate lying flat for the study, thin-section multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) provides the anatomic detail that permits planning of therapy and is useful when the clinical and radiologic presentations are discrepant and the patient is not responding to therapy or in further defining a radiographic abnormality. Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and monitoring of bronchiectasis and the management of complications. Exacerbation of bronchiectasis can confer substantial potential morbidity, usually secondary to recurrent infection. In severe cases of bronchiectasis, massive hemoptysis can lead to death. CXR is useful as an initial screening tool and during acute exacerbations, but has limited sensitivity and specificity. Thin-section MDCT is the reference standard for diagnosis and quantification of bronchiectasis, providing detailed morphological informations. Radiologists must know various causes of bronchiectasis, including common causes, such as recurrent infection or aspiration, and uncommon causes, such as congenital immunodeficiencies and disorders of cartilage development. In industrialized countries, inhalational exposures to various toxicants are commonplace. Most acute toxic inhalations come from industries, home, and recreational sources. In addition to individual susceptibility, the characteristics of inhaled substances such as water solubility, size of substances, and chemical properties may affect disease severity as well as its location. A detailed history becomes even more important in such a patient and may help make a difference in the often chaotic setting of the emergency department. Laboratory evaluation, arterial blood gas analysis, and supportive measures, including the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation), may be required. Unfortunately, the varied presentations result in a nonspecific clinical syndrome and make diagnosis somewhat difficult. Despite substantial limitations, imaging can help in showing diffuse interstitial, alveolar, or mixed infiltrates, segmental consolidation, hyperinflation, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion.

The chapter explores, with reference to Derrida and Sloterdijk, the tendency of immunitary purification and protection to recoil back upon their original designs.

Our study highlights that direct (poultry mortality) and indirect impacts (consequence of the measures imposed by the government to contain the virus, fluctuation of consumers\u2019 demand, etc.) tend to be relatively limited when compared to the permanent state of instability which characterises the context of poultry production in the surveyed village. This instability is mainly related to numerous and regular poultry infectious diseases and market fluctuations. If international community considers H5N1 as a zoonotic risk and a pandemic threat which asks for emergency tools, H5N1 is framed by the farmers of our study as an epizootic problem manageable through routinised measures.

There are a wide range of materials that have been known to prevent attachment and proliferation of microbes on material surfaces. These include antibiotics, metal ions and quaternary ammonium compounds. Given the availability of these various antibacterial materials, concerns about antibiotics-resistance, environmental pollution, relatively complex processing and high cost have been of much recent interest. Antimicrobial properties of nanomaterials have been explored to meet these challenges. Various nanomaterials including silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), titanium oxide nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been found to be highly effective bacterial-killing materials. The most well-known examples are silver and silver-based compounds, which were well known to be antiseptic to a spectrum of bacterium even in ancient times. AgNPs have proven to possess high antibacterial activity with minimal perturbation to human cells. Consequently, widespread applications of AgNPs have been found in medical and environmental areas [1]. More recently, carbon nanomaterials have emerged as a type of novel antibacterial nanomaterials, including CNTs and graphene.

In studies of older children, rhinovirus becomes the major virus associated with asthma. These relationships are outlined in the box on page 36. In the past, this relationship was more difficult to appreciate, because rhinovirus does not always grow well in culture. In addition, the linkage between asthma and atopy during childhood has raised the question whether viral infections alone can precipitate exacerbations of asthma. Use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure viral nucleic acid material has provided the opportunity to study virus-induced wheezing among children in greater detail, and investigations of experimental rhinovirus infections in adults have demonstrated how this virus can augment both the early and late phase manifestations of airway hyperreactivity. This article reviews recent advances that have enhanced our understanding of virus-induced wheezing, along with new information indicating that interactions between viral infections and allergic inflammation may be critical to the pathogenesis of acute symptoms.","publish_time":"1998-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heymann, Peter W.; Zambrano, Juan C.; Rakes, Gary P.","journal":"Immunol Allergy Clin North Am","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e44a6aff7d2c4227bfb89037cbdd914ff631ce4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125794.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125794/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections","virus-induced wheezing","understanding of virus","major virus","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory tract infections","investigations of experimental rhinovirus infections","infantile wheezing","exacerbations of asthma","viral nucleic acid material","studies of older children","PCR","interactions","opportunity","allergic inflammation","new information","childhood","late phase manifestations of airway hyperreactivity","adults","strong association","linkage","atopy","RSV","question","pathogenesis of acute symptoms","polymerase chain reaction","recent advances","box","past","article","addition","relationships","page","culture"],"language":"en"},

In up to a third of patients following allogeneic HCT, infection can progress from an upper to a lower respiratory tract infection. Without vaccines or effective therapeutics for most viruses, very little can be done beyond supportive care. OBJECTIVES: There is a need to identify risk factors for virus acquisition in HCT recipients in order to develop and implement better preventative interventions. METHODS: In a prospective study, 471 HCT patients enrolled between 2005 and 2010 underwent weekly PCR-based surveillance for RSV, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1-4, influenza A and B, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus. Detailed weekly surveys were collected from subjects for up to 1 year post-transplant on symptoms and exposures to children under 10 years or sick contacts (within 3 feet for more than 1 hour total in the past week). We performed multivariable Cox regression analysis to identify risk factors associated with the time to first positive respiratory viral detection by PCR (asymptomatic and symptomatic) within the first 100 days HCT. RESULTS: In this cohort, 211 patients (45%) acquired a respiratory virus in the first 100 days after transplant. Of those infected, 88 (42%) were symptomatic with at least 2 respiratory symptoms. We found significantly higher risk of acquiring any respiratory viral infection for patients with underlying chronic leukemia compared with other hematologic malignancies [hazard ratio (HR) 1.79 (1.16 \u2013 2.77)], exposure to children under or over 4 years [HR 1.84 (1.36 \u2013 2.48)], exposure to contacts with cold symptoms [HR 1.47 (1.02 \u2013 2.12)], exposure to systemic steroids [HR 1.49 (1.07 \u2013 2.08)], and absolute monocyte counts \u003C 100/\u00B5L [HR 1.81 (1.12 \u2013 2.94)]. Age, age of child exposure, gender, smoking history, season, conditioning regimen, donor relationship, cell source, presence of acute GVHD, albumin level, total IgG level, lymphocyte counts, and neutrophil counts were not associated with risk for acquisition. We also analyzed the association of these same variables with the time to first positive respiratory viral detection with symptomatic respiratory disease. We found that exposure to children [HR 1.56 (1.03 \u2013 2.35)] and exposure to steroids [HR 1.59 (1.01 \u2013 2.52)] remained associated with acquisition of symptomatic respiratory viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the contribution of both exposure and immunologic determinants to the risk of respiratory viral acquisition with and without development of symptoms. Although many infections were asymptomatic, patients receiving steroids and those in close proximity to children may benefit from closer monitoring and counseling in the early post-transplant period.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Xie, Hu; Waghmare, Alpana; Campbell, Angela P; Cheng, Guang-Shing; Davis, Chris; Kuypers, Jane M; Chien, Jason; Pergam, Steven A.; Liu, Catherine; Callais, Cheryl; Jerome, Keith R; Leisenring, Wendy M; Englund, Janet A; Boeckh, Michael J","journal":"Biol Blood Marrow Transplant","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128430/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsyMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","respiratory virus","risk of respiratory viral acquisition","Respiratory infections","acquisition of symptomatic respiratory viral infection","symptomatic respiratory disease","HCT patients","positive respiratory viral detection","lower respiratory tract infection","children","risk factors","virus acquisition","days HCT","age of child exposure","HCT lead","higher risk","HCT recipients","allogeneic HCT","cold symptoms","development of symptoms","time","lymphocyte counts","neutrophil counts","parainfluenza virus","year post-transplant","systemic steroids","years","early post-transplant period","total IgG level","absolute monocyte counts","albumin level","hour total","weekly PCR-based surveillance","sick contacts","supportive care","health care costs","Detailed weekly surveys","presence of acute GVHD","conditioning regimen","cell source","season","donor relationship","smoking history","mortality","RSV","significant morbidity","hematologic malignancies","underlying chronic leukemia","counseling","gender","exposures","immunologic determinants","metapneumovirus","subjects","closer monitoring","contribution","order","multivariable Cox regression analysis","rhinovirus","pulmonary complications","feet","hazard ratio","\u00B5L","prospective study","close proximity","need","INTRODUCTION","vaccines","effective therapeutics","viruses","coronavirus","past week","variables","data","adenovirus","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","cohort","preventative interventions","RESULTS","association","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

As similar symptoms are elicited by the two pathogens, it is difficult for their differential diagnosis. So far, no reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay has been found to differentiate between H9 AIV and IBV in one reaction. Therefore, developing a sensitive and specific method is of importance to simultaneously detect and differentiate H9 AIV and IBV. In this study, a duplex RT-PCR (dRT-PCR) was established. Two primer sets target the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H9 AIV and the nucleocapsid (N) gene of IBV, respectively. Specific PCR products were obtained from all tested H9 AIVs and IBVs belonging to the major clades circulating in China, but not from AIVs of other subtypes or other infectious avian viruses. The sensitivity of the dRT-PCR assay corresponding to H9 AIV, IBV and mixture of H9 AIV and IBV were at a concentration of 1\u00D710(1), 1.5\u00D710(1) and 1.5\u00D710(1) 50% egg infective doses (EID(50)) mL(\u22121), respectively. The concordance rates between the dRT-PCR and virus isolation were 99.1 and 98.2%, respectively, for detection of samples from H9N2 AIV or IBV infected chickens, while the concordance rate was 99.1% for detection of samples from H9N2 AIV and IBV co-infected chickens. Thus, the dRT-PCR assay reported herein is specific and sensitive, and suitable for the differential diagnosis of clinical infections and surveillance of H9 AIVs and IBVs.","publish_time":"2016-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"WEI, Yan-di; GAO, Wei-hua; SUN, Hong-lei; YU, Chen-fang; PEI, Xing-yao; SUN, Yi-peng; LIU, Jin-hua; PU, Juan","journal":"J Integr Agric","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128909/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene of H9 AIV","mixture of H9 AIV","H9N2 AIV","gene of IBV","dRT-PCR assay","IBV infected chickens","surveillance of H9 AIVs","tested H9 AIVs","Specific PCR products","duplex RT-PCR","IBV co-infected chickens","H9 subtype avian influenza virus","infectious bronchitis virus","virus isolation","detection of samples","IBVs","major pathogens","specific method","infectious avian viruses","differential diagnosis of clinical infections","major clades","concordance rates","reduced egg production","egg infective doses","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","respiratory disease","nucleocapsid","great economic losses","hemagglutinin","poultry","subtypes","importance","primer sets","EID","China","study","sensitivity","concentration","similar symptoms"],"language":"en"},

The \u201CPrairie Epidemic Strain\u201D (PES) has been recently identified in up to 30% of patients at prairie-based CF centres, however, its clinical impact remains to be determined. METHODS: A cohort study of adults with cystic fibrosis from 1981\u20132014 was conducted and all PA isolates from clinical visits were prospectively collected. PA strain typing at clinic enrolment, and most recent was conducted by PFGE. Patients were divided into one of four cohorts: no PA, transient PA, unique chronic PA, and chronic PES. Random effects and proportional Cox hazard models were conducted for outcome of death, transplantation and FEV1% decline. RESULTS: 204 patients (54% male) with CF were analysed: 38 no PA, 20 transient PA, 103 unique PA, 43 PES. Baseline FEV1% was lowest in the chronic PES group (p = 0.002). Overall rate of FEV1% decline was \u20131.19%/year (95% CI: \u20131.41 to \u20130.97, p\u003C0.001); the chronic PES group had the greatest rate of decline at \u20131.24%/year (p\u003C0.001). There were a total of 42 deaths and 37 transplants through 1862 and 2050 follow-up years, respectively. The age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death was not different for the PA groups compared to the no PA group. Relative to the no PA group, risk of transplant was increased in those with chronic PES (HR 9.13, CI 1.29\u201369, p = 0.032) compared to the no PA group. CONCLUSION: Chronic PES infection is significantly associated with a greater rate of FEV1% decline and risk of lung transplantation but not with increased risk of death compared to no PA infection.","publish_time":"2015-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Somayaji, R.; Lam, J.; Surette, M.; Waddell, B.; Purighalla, S.; Sibley, C.; Rabin, H.R.; Parkins, M.D.","journal":"J Cyst Fibros","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjszNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PA","PFGE","PES"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unique PA","transient PA","PA strain","PA infection","PA groups","PA isolates","unique chronic PA","chronic PES group","Chronic PES infection","patients","greatest rate of decline","greater rate of FEV1","increased risk of death","Overall rate of FEV1","Baseline FEV1","outcome of death","risk of lung transplantation","risk of transplant","CI","prairie-based CF centres","Prairie Epidemic Strain","clinical visits","clinical impact","proportional Cox hazard models","age-adjusted hazard ratio","cohort study of adults","Random effects","Transmissible Pseudomonas aeruginosa","strains","transplants","cystic fibrosis","OBJECTIVES","clinic enrolment","METHODS","CONCLUSION","cohorts","total","deaths","follow-up years","male","poorer prognosis","PFGE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, the species in genus Bupleurum L. could be potential herbs of immunomodulator, antineoplastic, anti-oxidant, etc. Meanwhile, as potential toxicities have been discovered in some constituents, it is urgent to establish a comprehensive quality evaluation system to ensure the safety and efficiency of herbs. This paper reviews on the phytochemical and pharmacological studies, especially for the toxicology and quality control of the species in Bupleurum L., which is a reference for the species in this genus for safe usage and further development.","publish_time":"2013-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"YAO, Ru-yu; ZOU, Yuan-feng; CHEN, Xing-fu","journal":"Chin Herb Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/113060e7b37d91b840fec0237208255733929e64.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129159/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bupleurum L."],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["species of genus Bupleurum","potential herbs of immunomodulator","quality control","immune diseases","efficiency of herbs","potential toxicities","treatment of inflammatory diseases","plenty of chemical constituents","comprehensive quality evaluation system","Chinese materia medica prescriptions","immunoregulation","popular ingredients","volatile oils","hepatoprotective effect","antitumor activity","polyacetylenes","flavonoids","safety","toxicology","pharmacological studies","phytochemical","lignins","polysaccharides","anti-oxidant","saikosaponins","safe usage","paper reviews","febrifuge efficacy","variety of biological activities","development","reference","Asia","Europe","years","coumarins","roots"],"language":"en"},

In this report, we established two RNAi systems to be easily observed with strong and obvious effect. The function of the P19 of tomato bushy stunt virus, which suppresses RNAi in mammal cells, was then studied using these two systems. Short hairpin RNAs targeting green fluorescence protein (pshRNA-GFP) and firefly luciferase (pshRNA-luc) were designed and inserted into a eukaryotic transcriptional vector pTZU6\u002B1, respectively. The shRNA expressing vectors were co-transfected with plasmids containing the target gene with or without P19. The GFP expression level was assayed by fluorescence microscopy, Western blotting and RT-PCR. The luciferase expression level was analyzed by the dual-luciferase assay system. pshRNA designed in this study down-regulated the target gene specifically and efficiently, with a decrease of expression of both genes of about 70%, respectively. When P19 was introduced into the RNAi systems, the expression of both GFP and the luciferase were mostly recovered compared with the control groups. The RNAi systems of GFP and luciferase were constructed successfully, demonstrating that P19 of tomato bushy stunt virus has the ability to counteract the RNAi effect induced by shRNA in mammal cells.","publish_time":"2008-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei-xian, Chen; Juan, Chen; Zhen-zhen, Zhang; Ai-long, Huang","journal":"Virol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09168fb23c9fc8d8ab0b7dd7b4ff4cf613585916.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090650/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNAi systems of GFP","RNAi effect","luciferase expression level","pshRNA-GFP","GFP expression level","firefly luciferase","decrease of expression","P19 of tomato bushy stunt virus","dual-luciferase assay system","pshRNA-luc","target gene","obvious effect","mammal cells","fluorescence microscopy","immune system","green fluorescence protein","ability","Short hairpin RNAs","proteins","parasitic hosts","viruses","Western blotting","plasmids","RNA interference","RT-PCR","vectors","eukaryotic transcriptional vector pTZU6","study","function","genes","report","control groups"],"language":"en"},

To explore the anti-cariogenic characteristics of rubusoside (Ru), a natural sweetener component in Rubus suavissimus S. Lee (Rosaceae), we investigated the inhibitory effect of Ru against the activity of mutansucrase and the growth of Streptococcus mutans. Ru (50 mM) showed 97% inhibitory activity against 0.1 U/mL mutansucrase of S. mutans with 500 mM sucrose. It showed competitive inhibition with a K(i) value of 1.1 \u00B1 0.2 mM and IC(50) of 2.3 mM. Its inhibition activity was due to hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions based on molecular docking analysis. Ru inhibited the growth of S. mutans as a bacteriostatic agent, with MIC and MBC values of 6 mM and 8 mM, respectively. In addition, Ru showed synergistic anti-bacterial activity when it was combined with curcumin. Therefore, Ru is a natural anti-cariogenic agent with anti-mutansucrase activity and antimicrobial activity against S. mutans.

Although the epidemiology of many respiratory viruses has been well characterized in this population, little is known about the epidemiology of human coronavirus (HoCV) infection. METHODS: We identified HSCT recipients with symptoms of a respiratory tract infection who tested positive for HoCV by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab from January 2013 to December 2016 at our hospital. NP swabs were analyzed by the FilmArray\u00AE Respiratory Panel, which detects 17 respiratory viruses, including 4 coronavirus serotypes. We reviewed the demographics, transplant type, comorbidities, smoking status, respiratory symptoms, co-pathogens, and radiographic findings of infected patients. We then assessed the incidence of developing a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), defined as new pulmonary infiltrates or detection of HoCV in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, within 30 days of initial diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 58 HSCT recipients who tested positive for HoCV. The median patient age was 54 years, 29 (50%) were men, and 24 (41%) were current or prior smokers. Fifty (86%) patients had received an allogeneic HSCT and 8 (14%) had received an autologous HSCT. The coronavirus serotypes were: OC43 (n = 19, 33%), NL63 (n = 18, 31%), HKU1 (n = 16, 28%), and 229E (n = 5, 9%). The median time from transplant until detection of HoCV infection was 135 days (IQR=256). Seventeen (29%) patients were lymphopenic at the time of diagnosis and 17 (29%) were receiving corticosteroids. The most common initial symptoms were cough (n = 41, 71%), rhinorrhea (n = 31, 53%), and dyspnea (n = 17, 29%), and 19 (33%) and 16 (28%) patients had fever and hypoxia, respectively. Seventeen patients (29%) developed a LRTI within 30 days of diagnosis and 43% harbored a co-pathogen in the blood or respiratory tract. Three patients (5%) were intubated for respiratory failure and 1 (2%) died within 30 days. CONCLUSION: HoCV infection is common in HSCT recipients and is caused by multiple serotypes. Nearly one-third of patients have fever and hypoxia upon initial diagnosis or progress to LRTI. Further research is needed to identify risk factors for HoCV LRTI in this population.

Antibiotic resistance is an emerging world health problem and unnecessary prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major contributor to this. Skin and soft-tissue infections are a common reason to receive a prescription for antibiotics. Currently there exists a trend for using broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for moderate to severe infections when more narrow-spectrum options would be adequate. This study aimed to characterize the choice of antibiotic being prescribed for the management of outpatient cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics and evaluate the success of a clinical order set outlining optimal therapy. METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review looking at antibiotic prescribing through the Emergency Department at The Moncton Hospital, in Moncton, New Brunswick. Charts were reviewed before and after the introduction of a clinical order set outlining optimal antibiotic therapy. The goal was to review charts from the pre- and post-intervention group and compare antibiotic usage, treatment failure rates, and adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients receiving IV antibiotics in the pre-intervention group, 3 received cefazolin, 50 received ceftriaxone, while 1 received levofloxacin. The median duration of IV therapy was four days. After the introduction of the clinical order set there was an absolute increase of 53.8% (n = 35) in the use of cefazolin and absolute decrease of 53.7% (n = 23) in the use of ceftriaxone in the post-intervention group of 59 patients. Both results were statistically significant (P \u003C 0.001). The median duration of IV therapy in this group was 3.5 days. In eligible patients, the clinical order set was utilized 61.1% of the time. There was no significant difference in rates of treatment failure or adverse events between cefazolin and ceftriaxone. CONCLUSION: The introduction of a clinical order set outlining the preferential use of once-daily cefazolin plus probenecid for the treatment of outpatient cellulitis lead to a statistically significant increase use of cefazolin, and decrease use of ceftriaxone, thus demonstrating a positive stewardship effect at a local level.

Sal CURB ASF liquid antimicrobial and CURB RM Extra liquid mold inhibitor (Kemin Industries, Des Moines, IA) were applied on SDP at 0.1% or 0.3% to determine effects of the products on chemical and functional properties of SDP. Regardless of product, there were no changes in SDP for analyzed protein, ash, pH, or moisture concentration, but IgG concentration in SDP was decreased 8% and 24%, respectively, for 0.1% and 0.3% inclusion of Sal CURB or CURB RM. Two feeding studies using weaned pigs were conducted to determine effects of formaldehyde applied at 0.3% to SDP (experiment 1) or 0.3% to a complete diet containing 5% SDP (experiment 2). Experiment 1 pigs (n = 265) were weaned at 20 \u00B1 2 d of age and allotted to five treatment groups. Experiment 2 pigs (n = 135) were weaned in two groups at 20 \u00B1 2 d of age and allotted to three treatments groups. In experiment 1, the untreated control diet contained soy protein concentrate (SPC) and test diets contained 2.5% or 5.0% SDP without or with formaldehyde treatment. In experiment 2, formaldehyde was applied to a diet containing 5% SDP and an untreated SPC control diet and an untreated diet containing 5% SDP were also included in the experiment. In experiment 1, linear increases (P \u003C 0.05) in average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) were observed as SDP was included in the diets and the relative bioavailability of formaldehyde-treated SDP was 62% (P = 0.018) if calculations were based on ADG and 15% (P = 0.031) if calculations were based on ADFI. In experiment 2, pigs fed the SDP diet untreated or treated with formaldehyde had increased (P \u003C 0.05) final body weight, ADG, ADFI, and G:F compared with pigs fed the control diet. However, formaldehyde treatment of the plasma-containing diet did not affect pig growth performance compared with pigs fed the untreated SDP diet. In conclusion, formaldehyde treatment applied directly on SDP affects analyzed concentrations of IgG and reduces growth rate of pigs. Treating a complete diet containing 5% SDP with formaldehyde did not affect pig growth performance, and pigs fed diets containing SDP had improved growth performance than those fed the control diet without SDP.","publish_time":"2019-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campbell, Joy M; Crenshaw, Joe D; Polo, Javier; Mellick, Dillon; Bienhoff, Mark; Stein, Hans H","journal":"Transl Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5f673c5ed9742ff2b2261ea257b4e1542ccf07d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107280.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107280/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kemin Industries, Des Moines","Sal CURB","CURB RM","SDP","ADG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SDP diet untreated","untreated SDP diet","formaldehyde-treated SDP","untreated diet","functional properties of SDP","formaldehyde-treated diets","complete diet","weaned pigs","growth performance of pigs","effects of formaldehyde treatment","untreated SPC control diet","untreated control diets","growth rate of pigs","relative bioavailability of formaldehyde","test diets","treatment groups","pig growth performance","ADG","ADFI","inclusion of Sal CURB","Sal CURB ASF liquid antimicrobial","average daily gain","IgG concentration","d of age","calculations","treatments groups","average daily feed intake","CURB RM Extra liquid mold inhibitor","moisture concentration","feed ratio","dried plasma","concentrations of IgG","soy protein concentrate","chemical composition of spray","Kemin Industries","feeding studies","final body weight","ash","Moines","pH","products","study","hypothesis","changes","linear increases","Experimental objectives","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Although many good medication adherence monitoring methods/techniques exist, the level of medication adherence for some chronic diseases by patients in rural settings is still suboptimal. Hence, the need for healthcare organisations to devise viable governance frameworks that will facilitate effective medication adherence monitoring and improved adherence by patients. This paper presents the conceptual overview of a governance framework for medication adherence monitoring and improvement that enables the collaboration of multiple stakeholders and data analytics (MUCODAF) in support of the patient in the treatment journey. The framework allows relevant stakeholders such as Healthcare workers (HCW), family members, and close friends to collaborate in support of a patient through the engagement of critical human factors such as empathy, motivation, encouragement, flexibility, and negotiation. The use cases of the framework, its technical composition, and the implementation plan are discussed in this paper. A concrete example of the application of the governance framework for medication adherence monitoring and improvement for a Tuberculosis patient in the African Country of Lesotho is presented to highlight the plausibility of the framework.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daramola, Olawande; Nyasulu, Peter","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfa81d4ccd9b6c5a3d1844dd23df9d8dbf584c7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134227.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["level of medication adherence","effective medication adherence monitoring","good medication adherence monitoring methods","improved adherence","general improvement","good health recovery","Tuberculosis patient","patients","support","paper","viable governance frameworks","Healthcare workers","healthcare organisations","relevant stakeholders","collaboration of multiple stakeholders","patient\u2019s health condition","techniques","chronic diseases","empathy","data analytics","MUCODAF","family members","engagement of critical human factors","motivation","rural settings","HCW","application","technical composition","conceptual overview","encouragement","flexibility","implementation plan","close friends","African Country of Lesotho","need","concrete example","treatment journey","use cases","negotiation","plausibility"],"language":"en"},

The study employs qualitative, interpretive case study as methodology and institutional theory as analytical lens to investigate regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive institutional effects on digital platform development and use for national health insurance in Ghana. The findings show the institutional enablers as: (1) health-seeking culture; (2) mobile network penetration and use; and (3) appropriate laws and regulations.

Businesses increasingly require more qualified IT professionals, be they male or female. In South Africa, the number of women professionals participating in the IT industry is less than 20%. A number of factors influence women\u2019s IT career choices, such as previous programming exposure, parents, teachers and role models. Research suggests that there are gender differences in preferences and beliefs that may affect career choices, including cultural influences. The role of culture in women\u2019s IT career decisions has not been extensively explored in South Africa. The aim of this exploratory study was to determine if the factor, Culture influences women\u2019s IT career choices in South Africa. An on-line survey was conducted amongst women IT professionals in South Africa to determine the factors that influenced their IT career choices. The data from the survey were analysed using Exploratory Factor Analysis. The results, specifically relating to the factor Culture, are reported in this paper. The findings indicate that the factor Culture plays an important role when women make IT career choices as well as when females decide to remain in an IT career. The study found that culture does play a significant role in IT career decisions for different ethnic groups in South Africa. The findings suggest that efforts must be made to educate young women in computational thinking and expose them to the many career opportunities available for women in the IT industry.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calitz, Andre P.; Cullen, Margaret; Fani, Dudu","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7aab945b3873dc4688ca97465f7f05af2967b2b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134313.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134313/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Skilled Information Technology","Exploratory Factor Analysis"],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["career choices","career decisions","South Africa","role of culture","factor Culture","number of women professionals","career opportunities available","Culture influences women\u2019s","young women","important role","significant role","role models","Exploratory Factor Analysis","number of factors","businesses","exploratory study","industry","findings","cultural influences","on-line survey","different ethnic groups","parents","teachers","previous programming exposure","beliefs","gender differences","preferences","Skilled Information Technology","computational thinking","Research","efforts","economy","aim","females","data","results","paper"],"language":"en"},

The data","doi":"10.1016/0167-5877(86)90017-6","pmcid":"PMC7134328","pubmed_id":null,"license":"no-cc","abstract":"Heifer calf management practices and clinical outcomes were studied on 104 randomly selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983. Data were collected at both the farm level (all farms) and the individual calf level (1968 calves, 35 farms). Farm-level management data were collected by means of questionnaires and farm visits. Calf-level management data were recorded by farmers on forms provided. Treatments for disease and mortality data were recorded by the farmers on the calves up to the age of weaning, the age at which calves were no longer fed milk or milk substitutes on a regular basis. Farm size ranged from 23 to 154 calvings per year. Farm-level mortality rates per six-month season (winter/summer) were skewed, with a mean of about 6%, a median of zero, and a range of 67%. Morbidity rates were similarly skewed. Four percent of liveborn heifer calves died, 20% were treated for scours, and 15% were treated for pneumonia before the age of weaning. Stated farm policies on calf rearing were implemented to varying degrees on different farms, as estimated from individual calf data. This posed particular problems for interpreting farm-level data, since the danger of committing an ecologic fallacy was high. The data set described in this paper formed the basis for an observational study of the interlationships of heifer calf management and clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2002-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waltner-Toews, D.; Martin, S.W.; Meek, A.H.; McMillan, I.","journal":"Prev Vet Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134328/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["farm level","Farm-level management data","Calf-level management data","interpreting farm-level data","individual calf data","individual calf level","mortality data","Farm-level mortality rates","data set","Farm size","farm visits","interlationships of heifer calf management","Heifer calf management practices","calf rearing","Stated farm policies","different farms","age of weaning","percent of liveborn heifer calves","clinical outcomes","farmers","selected Holstein dairy farms","milk substitutes","regular basis","Morbidity rates","six-month season","southwestern Ontario","winter","observational study","particular problems","paper","degrees","danger","ecologic fallacy","summer","Treatments","disease","questionnaires","calvings","pneumonia","forms","median","range","year","mean","scours"],"language":"en"},

Technological advances in connectivity and digitisation are enabling vertically and horizontally integrated networks. The highly technical and dynamic environment in which various types of relationships exist requires a high level of cooperation and transparency between partners. The importance for Small and Medium Sized Organisations (SMEs) to develop and improve their relational capabilities is widely acknowledged. This research paper thus presents a tool and methodology that will enable SMEs to assess and improve these capabilities within the organisation. This paper aims to identify those requirements and practices described in the literature as conducive to sustainable relationship formation and development. A Relational Capability Maturity Model (RCMM) is proposed as a tool that will be able to address the requirements across the various functions of the organisation.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Els, Caro; Grobbelaar, Sara; Kennon, Denzil","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b765bdbbad167e5ce061bee6a0cb69979826962c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134383.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Medium Sized Organisations"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SMEs","tool","requirements","relational capabilities","various types of relationships","various functions","research paper","Inter-organisational relationships","Relational Capability Maturity Model","literature","sustainable relationship formation","Medium Sized Organisations","RCMM","high level of cooperation","increased attention","dynamic environment","digitisation","context","transparency","development","importance","Technological advances","connectivity","partners","practices","methodology","industrial revolution","integrated networks"],"language":"en"},

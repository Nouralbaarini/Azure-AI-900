In acute viral infections, this balance involves induction and inhibition of innate responses. Foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus (FMDV) is considered one of the most contagious viruses known and is characterized by rapid induction of clinical disease in cloven hoofed animals exposed to infection. Viral shedding is extensive before the equally rapid resolution of acute disease. This positive strand RNA virus is an extremely successful pathogen, due in part to the ability to interrupt the innate immune response. Previous reviews have described the inhibition of cellular innate responses in the infected cell both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we present a review of virus inhibition of cells that are a source of antiviral function in swine. Particularly in the case of dendritic cells and natural killer cells, the virus has evolved mechanisms to interrupt the normal function of these important mediators of innate function, even though these cells are not infected by the virus. Understanding how this virus subverts the innate response will provide valuable information for the development of rapidly acting biotherapeutics to use in response to an outbreak of FMDV.","publish_time":"2008-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Golde, William T.; Nfon, Charles K.; Toka, Felix N.","journal":"Immunol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e4b1bb22ffe0cbbb8c91592533f6aea369915f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165979.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065x.2008.00672.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18837777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["review of virus inhibition of cells","inhibition of innate responses","mouth disease virus","innate immune response","inhibition of cellular innate responses","important mediators of innate function","positive strand RNA virus","natural killer cells","rapid induction of clinical disease","case of dendritic cells","rapid resolution of acute disease","normal function","source of antiviral function","acute viral infections","successful pathogens","tenuous balance","Viral shedding","infected cell","outbreak of FMDV","cloven hoofed animals","hosts","valuable information","development","interface","mechanisms","acting biotherapeutics","Summary","swine","ability","Foot","Previous reviews","contagious viruses"],"language":"en"},

Nasopharyngeal swabs from hematological patients were screened for influenza, parainfluenza and RSV on admission as well as on development of respiratory symptoms. Consecutive swabs were collected until viral clearance. Out of 672 tested patients, a total of 111 patients (17%) were infected with one of the investigated viral agents: 40 with influenza, 13 with parainfluenza and 64 with RSV; six patients had influenza/RSV or parainfluenza/RSV co-infections. The majority of infected patients (n = 75/111) underwent stem cell transplantation (42 autologous, 48 allogeneic, 15 autologous and allogeneic). LRTI was observed in 48 patients, of whom 15 patients developed severe LRTI, and 13 patients with respiratory tract infection died. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a variety of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), influenza B, parainfluenza 3 and RSV A, B viruses. RSV A was detected in 54 patients, RSV B in ten patients. The newly emerging RSV A genotype ON1 predominated in the study cohort and was found in 48 (75%) of 64 RSV-infected patients. Furthermore, two distinct clusters were detected for RSV A genotype ON1, identical RSV G gene sequences in these patients are consistent with nosocomial transmission. Long-term viral shedding for more than 30 days was significantly associated with prior allogeneic transplantation (p = 0.01) and was most pronounced in patients with RSV infection (n = 16) with a median duration of viral shedding for 80 days (range 35\u2013334 days).

The possible use of smallpox as a bioterrorism agent as well as the continuous occurrence of zoonotic pox virus infections document the relevance to deepen the understanding for virus host interactions. Since the permissiveness of pox infections is independent of hosts surface receptors, but correlates with the ability of the virus to infiltrate the antiviral host response, it directly depends on the hosts proteome set. In this report the proteome of HEK293 cells infected with Vaccinia Virus strain IHD-W was analyzed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-PSD-TOF MS in a bottom-up approach. RESULTS: The cellular and viral proteomes of VACV IHD-W infected HEK293 cells, UV-inactivated VACV IHD-W-treated as well as non-infected cells were compared. Derivatization of peptides with 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate (SPITC) carried out on ZipTip\u03BC-C18 columns enabled protein identification via the peptides\u0027 primary sequence, providing improved s/n ratios as well as signal intensities of the PSD spectra. The expression of more than 24 human proteins was modulated by the viral infection. Effects of UV-inactivated and infectious viruses on the hosts\u0027 proteome concerning energy metabolism and proteins associated with gene expression and protein-biosynthesis were quite similar. These effects might therefore be attributed to virus entry and virion proteins. However, the modulation of proteins involved in apoptosis was clearly correlated to infectious viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The proteome analysis of infected cells provides insight into apoptosis modulation, regulation of cellular gene expression and the regulation of energy metabolism. The confidence of protein identifications was clearly improved by the peptides\u0027 derivatization with SPITC on a solid phase support. Some of the identified proteins have not been described in the context of poxvirus infections before and need to be further characterised to identify their meaning for apoptosis modulation and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2011-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bartel, Sebastian; Doellinger, Joerg; Darsow, Kai; Bourquain, Daniel; Buchholz, Rainer; Nitsche, Andreas; Lange, Harald A","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a27cb38e8670f317f707a16661115a42b5b1b9fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3169512.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21806805/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VACV","PSD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modulation of proteins","virus entry","proteome of HEK293 cells","proteome analysis of infected cells","non-infected cells","virus host interactions","apoptosis modulation","virion proteins","human proteins","identified proteins","Vaccinia Virus strain IHD-W","continuous occurrence of zoonotic pox virus infections","permissiveness of pox infections","viral proteomes of VACV IHD-W infected HEK293 cells","hosts\u0027 proteome","UV-inactivated VACV IHD-W","hosts proteome set","regulation of cellular gene expression","regulation of energy metabolism","protein-biosynthesis","peptides\u0027 derivatization","context of poxvirus infections","SPITC","infectious viruses","Effects of UV","confidence of protein identifications","MALDI-PSD","PSD spectra","improved s","viral infection","Derivatization of peptides","peptides\u0027 primary sequence","possible use of smallpox","successful eradication of smallpox","antiviral host response","independent of hosts surface receptors","insight","relevance","n ratios","signal intensities","bioterrorism agent","dimensional gel electrophoresis","ZipTip\u03BC-C18 columns","considerable health threat","vaccination programme","TOF MS","solid phase support","understanding","sulfophenyl isothiocyanate","RESULTS","meaning","pathogenesis","CONCLUSIONS","report","BACKGROUND","ability","approach"],"language":"en"},

To ensure availability of donor cells on the scheduled date of infusion, many sites now collect cryopreserved grafts before the start of pretransplantation conditioning. Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (ptCY) is an increasingly used approach for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, but the impact of graft cryopreservation on the outcomes of allo-HCT using ptCY is not known. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared the outcomes of HCT using cryopreserved versus fresh grafts in patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancy with ptCY. We analyzed 274 patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing allo-HCT between 2013 and 2018 with cryopreserved grafts and ptCY. Eighteen patients received bone marrow grafts and 256 received peripheral blood stem cell grafts. These patients were matched for age, graft type, disease risk index (DRI), and propensity score with 1080 patients who underwent allo-HCT with fresh grafts. The propensity score, which is an assessment of the likelihood of receiving a fresh graft versus a cryopreserved graft, was calculated using logistic regression to account for the following: disease histology, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), HCT Comorbidity Index, conditioning regimen intensity, donor type, and recipient race. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression and disease-free survival (DFS). Because of multiple comparisons, only P values \u003C.01 were considered statistically significant. The 2 cohorts (cryopreserved and fresh) were similar in terms of patient age, KPS, diagnosis, DRI, HCT-CI, donor/graft source, and conditioning intensity. One-year probabilities of OS were 71.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.3% to 73.8%) with fresh grafts and 70.3% (95% CI, 64.6% to 75.7%) with cryopreserved grafts (P = .81). Corresponding probabilities of OS at 2 years were 60.6% (95% CI, 57.3% to 63.8%) and 58.7% (95% CI, 51.9% to 65.4%) (P = .62). In matched-pair regression analysis, graft cryopreservation was not associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for cryopreserved versus fresh, 1.05; 95% CI, .86 to 1.29; P = .60). Similarly, rates of neutrophil recovery (HR, .91; 95% CI, .80 to 1.02; P = .12), platelet recovery (HR, .88; 95% CI, .78 to 1.00; P = .05), grade III-IV acute GVHD (HR, .78; 95% CI, .50 to 1.22; P = .27), NRM (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, .86 to 1.55; P = .32) and relapse/progression (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, .97 to 1.50; P = .09) were similar with cryopreserved grafts versus fresh grafts.

To investigate if WU virus is related to acute respiratory infections in infants and children in Beijing, specimens collected from 674 pediatric patients with ARI from April 2007 to May 2008 and from 202 children without ARI were used for this investigation. Common respiratory viruses were tested by virus isolation and/or antigen detection by indirect immunofluorescent assay followed by RT-PCR or PCR for other viruses associated with respiratory infections in specimens collected from patients with ARI before WU virus DNA was detected. WU virus DNA was detected by initial screening and secondary confirmation PCR for all specimens. The region encoding the VP2 gene of the virus was amplified from 17 WU-virus-positive clinical specimens, and sequence analysis was performed. Thirty-eight of 674 (5.6%) specimens from patients with ARI and 3 of 202 (1.5%) specimens from children without ARI yielded PCR products with the predicted molecular weight, using either screening or confirmation primer sets, indicating that these specimens were WU virus positive. However, more than 60% of the 38 WU-virus-positive specimens from patients with ARI were also positive for one or more respiratory viruses. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the region encoding the VP2 gene from 17 Beijing WU viruses shared high homology (\u003E98.5%) with sequences from GenBank and among themselves.

Climate change affects infectious diseases directly and indirectly. Meteorological factors including temperature, precipitation, humidity and radiation influence infectious disease by modulating pathogen, host and transmission pathways. Meteorological disasters such as droughts and floods directly impact the outbreak and transmission of infectious diseases. Climate change indirectly impacts infectious diseases by altering the ecological system, including its underlying surface and vegetation distribution. In addition, anthropogenic activities are a driving force for climate change and an indirect forcing of infectious disease transmission. International travel and rural-urban migration are a root cause of infectious disease transmission. Rapid urbanization along with poor infrastructure and high disease risk in the rural-urban fringe has been changing the pattern of disease outbreaks and mortality. Land use changes, such as agricultural expansion and deforestation, have already changed the transmission of infectious disease. Accelerated air, road and rail transportation development may not only increase the transmission speed of outbreaks, but also enlarge the scope of transmission area. In addition, more frequent trade and other economic activities will also increase the potential risks of disease outbreaks and facilitate the spread of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2013-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, XiaoXu; Tian, HuaiYu; Zhou, Sen; Chen, LiFan; Xu, Bing","journal":"Sci China Earth Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db0a5c09a376ce3e2ba5412bc1dd5a2745de6e03.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-013-4635-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288763/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission of infectious diseases","root cause of infectious disease transmission","indirect forcing of infectious disease transmission","spread of infectious diseases","radiation influence infectious disease","transmission pathways","transmission mode","transmission speed of outbreaks","pattern of disease outbreaks","Climate change","scope of transmission area","high disease risk","potential risks of disease outbreaks","Global change","addition","rural-urban migration","rural-urban fringe","earth system","ecological system","economic activities","anthropogenic activities","large-scale changes","Meteorological factors","Meteorological disasters","Land use changes","modulating pathogen","precipitation","humidity","poor infrastructure","driving force","host","road","rail transportation development","underlying surface","temperature","floods","Accelerated air","agricultural expansion","frequent trade","droughts","human society","International travel","Rapid urbanization","vegetation distribution","deforestation","mortality"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, the paper compares and contrasts the Canadian and Australian responses on xenotransplantation to consider what lessons can be learnt about the regulation of a complex and controversial biotechnology. Sobbrio and Jorqui described public engagement on xenotransplantation in these countries as \u2018important forms of experimental democracy.\u2019 While Canada experimented with a novel nation-wide public consultation, Australia sought public input within the context of a national inquiry. In both instances, the outcome was a temporary moratorium on all forms of clinical xenotransplantation comparable to the policies adopted in some European countries. In addition, the Australian xenotransplantation ban coincided with a temporary global ban on experimental islet allotransplantation in 2007. Through historical and comparative research, this paper investigates how public controversies over organ and tissue transplantation can inform our understanding of the mediation of interspeciality and the regulation of a highly contested technoscience. It offers an alternative perspective on the xenotransplantation controversy by exploring the ways in which coinciding moratoriums on islet allograft and xenograft challenge, complicate and confound our assumptions regarding the relationships between human and animal, between routine surgery and clinical experimentation, between biomedical science and social science, and between disease risks and material contagion.","publish_time":"2015-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Myra","journal":"Life Sci Soc Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb6c8bb97e2115a2551f7a278889f3dd54c538fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4617985.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40504-015-0030-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26497322/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jorqui"],"organizations":["While Canada"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["public input","public debate","public engagement","public controversies","Australian xenotransplantation ban","xenotransplantation controversy","paper","forms of clinical xenotransplantation comparable","experimental islet allotransplantation","history of experimental islet transplantation","novel nation-wide public consultation","tissue transplantation","islet allograft","regulation","important forms of experimental democracy","temporary global ban","human therapies","clinical experimentation","temporary moratorium","social science","biomedical science","Australian responses","European countries","use of living animal organs","routine surgery","disease risks","moratoriums","context","policies","xenograft challenge","understanding","ways","Jorqui","comparative research","material contagion","controversial biotechnology","mediation of interspeciality","assumptions","outcome","relationships","alternative perspective","Sobbrio","Canada","lessons","addition","national inquiry","contested technoscience","instances"],"language":"en"},

Like other coronaviruses, PEDV N protein is a nucleocapsid protein and abundantly presents at all stages of infection. Previously, we reported that the N protein of trypsin-independent PEDV 8aa is cleaved during virus replication. In this study, we further investigated the nature of N protein cleavage using various methods including protease cleavage assays with or without various inhibitors and mutagenesis study. We found that PEDV 8aa infection in Vero cells leads to apoptotic cell death, and caspase 6 or 7 can cleave PEDV 8aa N protein at the late stage of the replication. The caspase-mediated cleavage occurs between D424 and G425 near the C-terminal of N protein. We also report that both cleaved and uncleaved N proteins are exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of PEDV infected cells.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oh, Changin; Kim, Yunjeong; Chang, Kyeong-Ok","journal":"Virus research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd33167c935b1f676c24c293cf5cba6db8dd5a1c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220301040?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425280/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220301040; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV N protein","aa N protein","N protein of trypsin","nature of N protein cleavage","independent PEDV","nucleocapsid protein","aa infection","uncleaved N proteins","cytoplasm of PEDV infected cells","caspase-mediated cleavage","stages of infection","virus replication","protease cleavage assays","various methods","various inhibitors","Vero cells","mutagenesis study","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","apoptotic cell death","significant economic loss","G425","D424","late stage","C-terminal","swine industry","neonatal piglets","mortality","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) has been developed for several viruses. Objectives: To prepare monoclonal antibodies to coronavirus strains, to incorporate them into a TR-FIA, and test the assay on clinical specimens. Study design: Monoclonal antibodies were prepared to the N nucleoprotein of the two human respiratory coronaviruses, HCV strains 229E and OC43. Monoclonals to both viruses were completely type-specific; they did not cross-react between themselves or with multiple strains of other respiratory viruses. These antibodies were configured into optimized EIA and TR-FIA tests. The all-monoclonal tests were then compared to polyclonal EIA tests in terms of their ability to detect virus in clinical specimens. Results: The all-monoclonal TR-FIA was uniformly the most sensitive, detecting virus in all 13 229E-positive specimens compared to 69% for the monoclonal EIA and 54% for the polyclonal EIA test. Similar results were obtained for 10 OC43-positive specimens: 100% in TR-FIA, 90% in monoclonal EIA, and 80% in polyclonal EIA. For 229E in TR-FIA, mean positive/negative (P/N) ratios were 143 for 229E-positive human embryonic lung fibroblast (HLF) cell culture fluids and 10 for positive nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens; for OC43 in TR-FIA, mean P/N values were 964 for OC43-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell culture fluids and 174 for positive NPA specimens. The sensitivities of the TR-FIA were determined with purified virions to be 0.308 ng virus per well for HCV-229E and 0.098 ng virus per well for HCV-OC43. Conclusions: This rapid and sensitive test appears to be much more sensitive than traditional antigen detection assays but will require more extensive field testing on clinical specimens.","publish_time":"1994-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hierholzer, John C.; Halonen, Pekka E.; Bingham, Patricia G.; Coombs, Richard A.; Stone, Yvonne O.","journal":"Clinical and Diagnostic Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd3e7ddb2fd67617369e927b01caf03a5747f675.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0928019794900205; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0928019794900205","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EIA","NPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monoclonal EIA","OC43-positive specimens","E-positive specimens","TR-FIA tests","all-monoclonal TR-FIA","positive NPA specimens","clinical specimens","monoclonal antibodies","OC43-positive rhabdomyosarcoma","polyclonal EIA tests","positive nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens","HCV-OC43","optimized EIA","all-monoclonal tests","HCV strains","ng virus","respiratory viruses","sensitive test","E-positive human embryonic lung fibroblast","cell culture fluids","human respiratory coronaviruses","N values","N nucleoprotein","multiple strains","coronavirus strains","mean P","diagnosis of respiratory infections","immunofluorescent assays","Similar results","traditional antigen detection assays","HLF","IFA","considerable attention","viral antigens","RD","ability","extensive field testing","terms","enzyme immunoassays","purified virions","ratios","Abstract Background","type-specific","Conclusions","Study design","fluoroimmunoassay","Monoclonals","Time","Objectives","sensitivities"],"language":"en"},

The main goal of our study was to develop a safer drug; a surfactin analogue with high anti-PEDV activity and low hemolytic activity. Compared with surfactin, one of the analogues we developed, SLP5, has lower hemolytic activity, with the same antiviral activity. The selectivity index of SLP5 is 52, while the SI for surfactin is 4, in other words, the safe and effective concentration range of SLP5 is 12 times greater than that of surfactin. Like surfactin, SLP5 has a direct antiviral effect on PEDV. Structurally, SLP5 is a linear lipopeptide with three carboxyl groups. Surfactin derivatives similar to SLP5 could be obtained by lactone bond hydrolyzation of surfactin, as well as total synthesis.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Lvfeng; Zhang, Shuai; Peng, Jie; Li, Yuchen; Yang, Qian","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71e8fcabcecb3f5ce3a699f95a618bd21a68bd76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6459484.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973929/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surfactin analogues","antiviral activity","potential utility of surfactin","Surfactin derivatives similar","lactone bond hydrolyzation of surfactin","low hemolytic activity","lower hemolytic activity","antiviral drug","high anti-PEDV activity","selectivity index of SLP5","hemolytic activities","anti-PEDV activities","effective concentration range of SLP5","direct antiviral effect","study","safer drug","chemical synthesis","total synthesis","various enveloped viruses","viral membrane fusion","times greater","critical micelle concentrations","linear lipopeptide","words","carboxyl groups","main goal","cytotoxicity"],"language":"en"},

This review will discuss the interplay between cellular membranes and positive-sense RNA virus replication, and will focus specifically on the potential structural and functional roles for cellular lipids in this process.","publish_time":"2010-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Miller, David J.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6fa578aa0397c1d6e2e0340b8581eb2c318974a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3187604.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v2051055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994671/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Positive-sense RNA viruses","viral replication","positive-sense RNA virus replication","assembly of functional viral RNA replication complexes","anti-viral therapies","functional roles","cellular lipids","manipulation of host intracellular membranes","humans","devastating diseases","molecular mechanisms","development of effective vaccines","animals","pathogens","interplay","incomplete understanding","common feature","process","plants","review"],"language":"en"},

One parameter bifurcation analysis is done with respect to general Holling parameters and infection rate. We utilize the MATCONT package to analyse the detailed bifurcation scenario as the two important interaction parameters are varied.

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important second messenger acting via two intracellular signaling molecules: protein kinase A (PKA) and the guanidine nucleotide exchange factor, Epac. We sought to investigate effects of increased cAMP level on the disruption of model airway epithelial barrier caused by RSV infection and the molecular mechanisms underlying cAMP actions. Human bronchial epithelial cells were infected with RSV-A2 and treated with either cAMP releasing agent, forskolin, or cAMP analogs. Structure and functions of the Apical Junctional Complex (AJC) were evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and permeability to FITC-dextran, and determining localization of AJC proteins by confocal microscopy. Increased intracellular cAMP level significantly attenuated RSV-induced disassembly of AJC. These barrier-protective effects of cAMP were due to the activation of PKA signaling and did not involve Epac activity. Increased cAMP level reduced RSV-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, including apical accumulation of an essential actin-binding protein, cortactin, and inhibited expression of the RSV F protein. These barrier-protective and antiviral-function of cAMP signaling were evident even when cAMP level was increased after the onset of RSV infection. Taken together, our study demonstrates that cAMP/PKA signaling attenuated RSV-induced disruption of structure and functions of the model airway epithelial barrier by mechanisms involving the stabilization of epithelial junctions and inhibition of viral biogenesis. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved in RSV-induced epithelial dysfunction and viral pathogenesis will help to develop novel anti-viral therapeutic approaches.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rezaee, Fariba; Harford, Terri J.; Linfield, Debra T.; Altawallbeh, Ghaith; Midura, Ronald J.; Ivanov, Andrei I.; Piedimonte, Giovanni","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ba9b89e1cab4bfe6b3b82046e458fec8eb12bbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5536269.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759570/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","Apical Junctional Complex","AJC","RSV F"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cAMP analogs","cAMP actions","intracellular cAMP level","effects of increased cAMP level","barrier-protective effects of cAMP","Increased cAMP level reduced RSV-induced reorganization","RSV-A2","cAMP releasing agent","RSV F protein","onset of RSV infection","attenuated RSV-induced disruption of structure","attenuated RSV-induced disassembly of AJC","disruption of model airway epithelial barrier","epithelial dysfunction","viral pathogenesis","viral infections","stabilization of epithelial junctions","functions","molecular mechanisms","Human bronchial epithelial cells","protein kinase","inhibition of viral biogenesis","Airway epithelium","activation of PKA","essential actin-binding protein","localization of AJC proteins","novel anti-viral therapeutic approaches","actin cytoskeleton","apical accumulation","Epac activity","Apical Junctional Complex","inhibited expression","crucial role","cortactin","FITC-dextran","permeability","molecules","forskolin","guanidine nucleotide exchange factor","transepithelial electrical resistance","outside world","antiviral-function","confocal microscopy","susceptibility","messenger","Cyclic adenosine monophosphate","understanding","study"],"language":"en"},

We aim to investigate the prevalence and age pattern of viral co-infection in children hospitalized with lower tract acute respiratory infection (LT-ARI), using molecular techniques. METHODS: A nested polymerase chain reaction approach was used to detect Influenza (A, B), metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (1\u20134), rhinovirus, adenovirus (A\u2014F), bocavirus and coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, OC43) in respiratory samples of children with acute respiratory infection prospectively admitted to any of the GENDRES network hospitals between 2011\u20132013. The results were corroborated in an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: A total of 204 and 97 nasopharyngeal samples were collected in the GENDRES and UK cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts, RSV was the most frequent pathogen (52.9% and 36.1% of the cohorts, respectively). Co-infection with multiple viruses was found in 92 samples (45.1%) and 29 samples (29.9%), respectively; this was most frequent in the 12\u201324 months age group.

The results were assessed and compared with those of conventionally processed samples. A variety of infectious agents, some with a potential for bioterrorism, and liver biopsies serving as an example for routine histopathology samples were studied. The samples represented virus-producing cell cultures (such as SARS-coronavirus, West Nile virus, Orthopox virus), bacteria suspensions (cultures of Escherichia coli and genetically knockout apathogenic Bacillus anthracis), suspensions of parasites (malaria Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania major, Microsporidia cuniculi, Caenorhabditis elegans), and whole Drosophila melanogaster flies infected with microsporidia. Fresh liver samples and infected flies were fixed in Karnovsky-fixative by microwaving (20min), all other samples were fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde or Karnovsky-fixative overnight or longer. Subsequently, all samples were divided to evaluate alternative processing protocols: one part of the sample was OsO4-postfixed, ethanol-dehydrated, Epon-infiltrated (overnight) in an automated tissue processor (LYNX, Leica), and polymerized at 60\u00B0C for 48h; in parallel the other part was microwave-assisted processed in the bench microwave device (REM, Milestone), including post-osmication and the resin block polymerization. The microwave-assisted processing protocol required at minimum 3h 20min: the respective epon resin blocks were uniformly polymerized allowing an easy sectioning of semi- and ultrathin sections. Sections collected on non-coated 200mesh grids were stable in the electron beam and showed an excellent preservation of the ultrastructure and high contrast, thus allowing an easy, unequivocal and rapid assessment of specimens. Compared with conventional routine methods, microwave technology facilitates a significant reduction in sample processing time from days to hours without any loss in ultrastructural details. Microwave-assisted processing could, therefore, be a substantial benefit for the routine electron microscopic diagnostic workload. Due to its speed and robust performance it could be applied wherever a rapid electron microscopy diagnosis is required, e.g., if bioterrorism or emerging agents are suspected. Combining microwave technology with digital image acquisition, the 1-day diagnosis based on ultrathin section electron microscopy will become possible, with crucial or interesting findings being consulted or shared worldwide with experts using modern telemicroscopy tools via Internet.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schroeder, Josef A.; Gelderblom, Hans R.; Hauroeder, Baerbel; Schmetz, Christel; Milios, Jim; Hofstaedter, Ferdinand","journal":"Micron","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bda3352e1f43085c1c1b2595b2bb3b57f1e24eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126925.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968432805002015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968432805002015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Caenorhabditis","Drosophila"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microwave technology","processed samples","routine histopathology samples","rapid diagnostic electron microscopy","rapid electron microscopy diagnosis","electron beam","ultrathin section electron microscopy","bench microwave device","Fresh liver samples","sample processing time","routine electron microscopic diagnostic workload","alternative processing protocols","Orthopox virus","rapid assessment of specimens","ultrathin sections","infected flies","Karnovsky-fixative overnight","bioterrorism","West Nile virus","conventional routine methods","suspensions of parasites","bacteria suspensions","Microsporidia cuniculi","image quality","cell cultures","day diagnosis","liver biopsies","respective epon resin blocks","emerging agents","cultures of Escherichia coli","digital image acquisition","easy sectioning of semi-","Drosophila melanogaster flies","resin block polymerization","variety of infectious agents","Leishmania major","malaria Plasmodium falciparum","hours","significant reduction","knockout apathogenic Bacillus anthracis","Caenorhabditis elegans","Milestone","SARS-coronavirus","mesh grids","days","post-osmication","excellent preservation","turnaround times","REM","potential","number","example","buffered glutaraldehyde","high contrast","substantial benefit","automated tissue processor","LYNX","Leica","modern telemicroscopy tools","experts","Internet","loss","ultrastructure","study","ultrastructural details","interesting findings","ethanol","minimum","speed","robust performance","OsO4","microwaving","purpose","results"],"language":"en"},

Thus, many recent studies use transient expression with plant viral vectors to achieve rapid high expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, followed by purification of antigen and intranasal delivery for effective stimulation of mucosal immune responses.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mason, Hugh S.; Thuenemann, Eva; Kiyono, Hiroshi; Kessans, Sarah; Matoba, Nobuyuki; Mor, Tsafrir","journal":"Mucosal Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61515abcd14687feeb6f17310e9190b99ad07b94.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158328.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124158474000653; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124158474000653","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Transgenic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antigen delivery","transgenic plants","plant-based vaccines","purification of antigen","use of plants","oral delivery of vaccines","crude plant material","transient expression","intranasal delivery","plant viral vectors","antigen-specific serum","edible vaccines","Transgenic grains","rapid high expression","low expression levels","mucosal antibodies","regulatory issues","effective stimulation of mucosal immune responses","Nicotiana benthamiana","robust vehicle","proof of concept","recent studies","production of recombinant proteins","rice","idea","ingestion","systems","years"],"language":"en"},

Strategies to maintain gut health are, thus, an important part in achieving the goal of improving animal health. A new strategy to do this involves two molecules: the iron transport protein ovotransferrin (IT) and \u03B1-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS), which result in the novel formulation of ITPGS. These molecules help reduce gut pathogens, while enhancing the absorption and bioavailability of therapeutic drugs, phytomedicines, and nanomedicines. This, in turn, helps to maintain normal health in animals. Maintaining the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in its normal condition is key for successful absorption and efficacy of any nutrient. A compromised GIT, due to an imbalance (dysbiosis) in the GIT microbiome, can lead to an impaired GI barrier system with impaired absorption and overall health of the animal. The molecules in ITPGS may address the issue of poor absorption by keeping the GI system healthy by maintaining the normal microbiome and improving the absorption of nutrients through multiple mechanisms involving antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial activities. The ITPGS technology can allow the dose of active pharmaceutical or herbal medicine to be significantly reduced in order to attain equal or better efficacy. With complimentary actions between IT and TPGS, ITPGS presents a novel approach to increase the bioavailability of drugs, phytoconstituents, nutrients, and nanomedicines by enhanced transport to the tissues at the site of action, while reducing gut pathogen load. The ITPGS approach appears to be a novel strategy for maintaining the health of animals by manipulation of microbiota.","publish_time":"2019-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Srivastava, Ajay; Lall, Rajiv; Talukder, Jamil; DuBourdieu, Dan; Gupta, Ramesh C.","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0727980b80bddd2728174a65e08275cf73000f7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6930530.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules24234289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31775281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ITPGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Gut health","normal health","animal health","overall health","health of animals","impaired absorption","absorption of nutrients","ITPGS approach","successful absorption","molecules","novel formulation of ITPGS","ITPGS technology","normal microbiome","novel approach","GIT microbiome","novel strategy","gut pathogens","issue of poor absorption","normal condition","bioavailability of drugs","nanomedicines","gut pathogen load","compromised GIT","impaired GI barrier system","GI system healthy","bioavailability of therapeutic drugs","enhanced transport","better efficacy","new strategy","iron transport protein ovotransferrin","anti-inflammatory","multiple mechanisms","\u03B1-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate","dose of active pharmaceutical","antioxidative","tissues","key","starting place","herbal medicine","site of action","order","imbalance","phytomedicines","phytoconstituents","antimicrobial activities","dysbiosis","manipulation of microbiota","goal","complimentary actions","gastrointestinal tract","turn","Strategies"],"language":"en"},

We found that the 15411-nucleotide genome of PL97-1 consisted of a 189-nucleotide 5\u2032 noncoding region (NCR), a 15071-nucleotide protein-coding region, and a 151-nucleotide 3\u2032NCR, followed by a poly (A) tail. The 5\u2032-end of PL97-1 began with 1ATG ACG TAT AGG(12). Comparison of the PL97-1 genome with the 11 fully sequenced PRRSV genomes currently available revealed sequence divergence ranging from 0.3% (the VR-2332-derived vaccine MLV RespPRRS/Repro strain) to 38% (the Dutch Lelystad strain). To better understand the genetic relationships between these different strains, phylogenetic analyses were performed on the full-length PRRSV genomes. Significantly, the phylogenetic tree based on the ORF1b or ORF7 genes most closely resembled the tree based on the full-length genomes. Thus, these single genes will be the most useful in revealing the genetic relationships between the different strains relative to their geographical distribution. Extensive phylogenetic analyses using the ORF7 sequences of 111 PRRSV isolates available revealed that PL97-1 is most closely related to the North American genotype VR-2332, a VR-2332-derived vaccine strain, and Chinese BJ-4. It is distantly related to the European genotype Lelystad. This study provides the largest full-length genome phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV that has been published to date, and supports an earlier genetic grouping of the many temporally and geographically diverse PRRSV strains currently isolated.","publish_time":"2004-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Shien-Young; Yun, Sang-Im; Park, Hyo-Sun; Park, Choi-Kyu; Choi, Hyo-Seong; Lee, Young-Min","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/070f5c06f0938fe01a4c2ec00a3c87910a3feb0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172542.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170204001868; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170204001868","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleotide genome of PL97","full-length PRRSV genomes","diverse PRRSV strains","sequenced PRRSV genomes","largest full-length genome phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV","phylogenetic tree","full-length genomes","complete nucleotide","end of PL97","derived vaccine strain","Repro strain","genetic relationships","Extensive phylogenetic analyses","Dutch Lelystad strain","genomic RNA of PL97","nucleotide protein-coding region","different strains relative","ORF7 genes","NCR","Korean strain of porcine reproductive","available revealed sequence divergence","North American genotype VR","earlier genetic grouping","European genotype Lelystad","derived vaccine MLV RespPRRS","ORF7 sequences","noncoding region","single genes","amino acid sequence","respiratory syndrome virus","geographical distribution","Chinese BJ","ORF1b","study","ATG ACG TAT AGG","date","serum","infected pig","poly","Comparison","tail"],"language":"en"},

In children previous studies have reported pneumococcal colonisation to be a symptomatic event and described a relationship between symptom severity/frequency and colonisation density. The evidence for this in adults is lacking in the literature. This study uses the experimental human pneumococcal challenge (EHPC) model to explore whether pneumococcal colonisation is a symptomatic event in healthy adults. METHODS: Healthy participants aged 18\u201350 were recruited and inoculated intra-nasally with either Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 6B, 23F) or saline as a control. Respiratory viral swabs were obtained prior to inoculation. Nasal and non-nasal symptoms were then assessed using a modified Likert score between 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (cannot function). The rate of symptoms reported between the two groups was compared and a correlation analysis performed. RESULTS: Data from 54 participants were analysed. 46 were inoculated with S. pneumoniae (29 with serotype 6B, 17 with serotype 23F) and 8 received saline (control). In total, 14 became experimentally colonised (30.4%), all of which were inoculated with serotype 6B. There was no statistically significant difference in nasal (p = 0.45) or non-nasal symptoms (p = 0.28) between the inoculation group and the control group. In those who were colonised there was no direct correlation between colonisation density and symptom severity. In the 22% (12/52) who were co-colonised, with pneumococcus and respiratory viruses, there was no statistical difference in either nasal or non-nasal symptoms (virus positive p = 0.74 and virus negative p = 1.0). CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal colonisation using the EHPC model is asymptomatic in healthy adults, regardless of pneumococcal density or viral co-colonisation.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trimble, Ashleigh; Connor, Victoria; Robinson, Ryan E.; McLenaghan, Daniella; Hancock, Carole A.; Wang, Duolao; Gordon, Stephen B.; Ferreira, Daniela M.; Wright, Angela D.; Collins, Andrea M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00ec586d591bfbe2f07a1322fe6501addac51798.json; document_parses/pdf_json/607a348807e535e6926fea723fa46273c6421397.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7064211.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32155176/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229558","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["EHPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pneumococcal colonisation","pneumococcal density","colonisation density","non-nasal symptoms","pneumococcal disease","viral co-colonisation","healthy adults","rate of symptoms","experimental human pneumococcal challenge","Healthy participants","control group","virus positive p","virus negative p","EHPC model","symptom severity","symptomatic event","inoculation group","saline","Respiratory viral swabs","respiratory viruses","statistical difference","Streptococcus pneumoniae","direct correlation","significant difference","correlation analysis","relationship","frequency","pre-requisite","study","serotypes","pneumococcus","children previous studies","modified Likert score","groups","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","Data","METHODS","INTRODUCTION","total","evidence","literature"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we have identified 40 Mafa-A and 60 Mafa-B exons 2 and 3 sequences from 30 unrelated cynomolgus macaques of Vietnamese origin. Among these alleles, 28 are novel. As for the remaining 72 known alleles, 15 alleles are shared with other cynomolgus macaque populations and 32 are identical to alleles previously reported in other macaque species. A potential recombination event was observed between Mafa-A1*091:02 and Mafa-A1*057:01. In addition, the Mafa-A1 genes were found to be more diverse than human HLA-A and the functional residues for peptide binding sites (PBS) or TCR binding sites (TBS) in Mafa-A1 have greater variability than that for non-PBS or non-TBS regions. Overall, this study provides important information on the diversity of Mafa-A and Mafa-B alleles from Vietnamese origin, which may help researchers to choose the most appropriate animals for their studies.","publish_time":"2019-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Shuting; Huang, Xia; Li, Shuang; Zhu, Mingjun; Zhuo, Min","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d2670b7397637426c285d293f7e5671d95e0e80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6836755.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6836755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cynomolgus"],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mafa-B alleles","diversity of Mafa","Mafa-A1 genes","Mafa-B exons","known alleles","unrelated cynomolgus macaques of Vietnamese origin","cynomolgus macaque populations","non-PBS","important information","information available","study","TCR binding sites","peptide binding sites","non-TBS regions","biomedical researches","appropriate animals","macaque species","polymorphism of MHC class","results of biomedical experiments","immunogenetic background of animals","diversity of major histocompatibility complex","important experimental animal models","functional residues","sequences","greater variability","researchers","Macaca fascicularis","human HLA","potential recombination event","addition","studies","humans","novel"],"language":"en"},

When such events occur, how should, and will, clinicians respond? The moral backbone of medical professionals\u2014a duty to put the needs of patients first\u2014may be sorely tested. DISCUSSION: It is incumbent on health care professionals to ask what we must do and what we should do if a dangerous health care situation threatens both ourselves and our community. Despite numerous medical ethical codes, nothing\u2014either morally or legally\u2014requires a response to risk-prone situations from civilian clinicians; it remains a personal decision. The most important questions are: What will encourage us to respond to these situations? And will we respond? These questions are necessary, not only for physicians and other direct health care providers, but also for vital health care system support personnel. Those who provide care in the face of perceived risk demonstrate heroic bravery, but the choice to do so has varied throughout history. To improve individual response rates, disaster planners and managers must communicate the risks clearly to all members of the health care system and help mitigate their risks by providing them with as much support and security as possible. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to remain in or to leave a risky health care situation will ultimately depend on the provider\u0027s own risk assessment and value system. If history is any guide, we can rest assured that most clinicians will choose to stay, following the heroic example established through the centuries and continuing today.","publish_time":"2018-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iserson, Kenneth V.","journal":"J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf81a0f6d1566b8d6709e7498706eb813520a2a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134772.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467918303597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29773480/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467918303597; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2018.04.021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care professionals","dangerous health care situation","risky health care situation","direct health care providers","vital health care system support personnel","risk-prone situations","risk assessment","risk-prone disasters","face of perceived risk","value system","risks","civilian clinicians","history","heroic bravery","moral backbone of medical professionals","heroic example","personal decision","important questions","individual response rates","numerous medical ethical codes","disaster planners","duty","managers","pandemics","provider\u0027s","physicians","members","help","Widespread epidemics","disturbing regularity","BACKGROUND","needs of patients","guide","centuries","security","choice","DISCUSSION","CONCLUSIONS","community","events"],"language":"en"},

Using SARS-CoV as a model, we will review the current knowledge of the interplay between coronavirus infection and the host innate immune system in vivo, and then discuss the mechanisms by which specific gene products antagonize the host innate immune response in cell culture models. Our data suggests that the SARS-CoV uses specific strategies to evade and antagonize the sensing and signaling arms of the interferon pathway.

METHODS: The analysis was undertaken in 118 infants with RSV or HRV bronchiolitis. Nasopharyngeal washes were collected for virological studies and molecular analysis of type III IFN responses. RESULTS: RSV elicited higher levels of IFN lambda subtypes when compared with HRV. A similar expression of type III IFN was found in RSVA or RSVB infected infants and in those infected with HRVA or HRVC viruses. Results also indicate that IFN lambda 1 and IFN lambda 2\u20133 levels were correlated with each other and with MxA and ISG56-mRNAs. In addition, a positive correlation exists between the IFN lambda1 levels and the clinical score index during RSV infection.

We here report a case of HCoV infection in a leukemia patient with fatal ARDS despite successful virus elimination by pegylated interferon\u2010alpha (PEG\u2010IFN\u2010\u03B1). CASE: The 27\u2010year\u2010old female pre\u2010T\u2010ALL patient was treated according to the German\u2010Multicenter Trial for Adult ALL protocol. No relevant infectious complications were seen until day 35 when the neutropenic patient developed fever without any clinical focus. Antibiotic prophylaxis was switched to meropenem. The patient deteriorated rapidly with respiratory failure due to ARDS. Anti\u2010infectious therapy was escalated to additional linezolid and liposomal amphotericine\u2010B. BAL revealed a significant viral load of HCoV\u2010NL63. Based on successful application of PEG\u2010IFN against the related SARS coronavirus in animal experiments, a single injection of 180 \u03BCg PEG\u2010IFN\u2010\u03B12b was applied. Despite immediate initiation of treatment and elimination of virus in subsequent tests, the progressive lung failure led to death 7 d after onset of fever with massive lung bleeding as a consequence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

Early diagnosis of STEC infection is important because of the contraindication for treating STEC using antimicrobial agents, and the intense supportive care needed if renal failure occurs.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hunt, John M.","journal":"Clinics in Laboratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e309b6a6094b5055961fb655646ba912fd0223cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126671.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272271209001267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20513540/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272271209001267; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cll.2009.11.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shiga"],"organizations":["STEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["natural reservoir of STEC","Shiga toxin type","Early diagnosis of STEC infection","hemolytic uremic syndrome","bloody diarrhea","Escherichia coli","cattle feces","diarrheogenic E coli","important enteric pathogens","virulence factors responsible","contraindication","intense supportive care","antimicrobial agents","consumption of foods","renal failure","normal intestinal flora","ruminants","Humans"],"language":"en"},

The experiment was repeated. Diarrhoea and shedding of oocysts were seen in all animals infected with the CPB-0 isolate. Clinical signs included depression, inappetence, vomiting (exclusively in the piglets), and death. Histological examination at 17 and 19 days post-infection revealed parasitic stages and microscopic changes primarily restricted to colon and rectum. The unintended presence of rotavirus in some of the experimental animals revealed an additive or synergistic effect between rotavirus and C. parvum as indicated by prolonged diarrhoea, increased oocyst shedding, decreased weight gain and elevated levels of serum haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA) in piglets infected simultaneously with both pathogens. The difference in daily weight gain between infected and control animals was significant only for piglets co-infected with rotavirus. The acute phase response of haptoglobin and SAA was characterised by a large individual variation. In piglets, co-infected with rotavirus, the levels of serum haptoglobin were 3.5 and 4.6 times higher in the infected versus the controls 6 and 9dpi, respectively (mean values: 2411 \u03BCg/ml\u00B1S.D. 2023 and 1840 \u03BCg/ml\u00B1S.D. 1697). In the controls infected with rotavirus, peak haptoglobin concentration was seen 3dpi (mean: 1022 \u03BCg/ml\u00B1S.D. 425). Elevated levels of SAA were seen in 1 of 6 piglets infected with C. parvum, and in 5 of 6 piglets co-infected with rotavirus. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03B1) was undetectable in all serum samples from piglets. The obvious advantages of the SPF pig model are the naturally acquired intestinal microflora, the development of distinct clinical signs similar to cryptosporidiosis in humans and calves, the size of the animals, and the accessibility of individuals born within a short time span. This makes the model ideal for dose\u2013response studies, evaluation of therapeutic agents as well as for assessment of differences in the clinical response to isolates of diverse genetic background. In conclusion, it was shown that the CPB-0 isolate was pathogenic to calves and piglets at a dose of 2.5\u00D7105 oocysts, and that the clinical signs could be replicated during separate experiments. Moreover, diarrhoea, oocyst shedding, body weight changes, histological alterations, and the acute phase response of haptoglobin and SAA were identified as useful parameters for discrimination of isolate-specific differences of pathogenicity.","publish_time":"2003-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enemark, H.

The analysis revealed enrichment for components of the nuclear transport machinery and the crucial interaction with NS3/4A protein in suppression of interferon\u2010\u03B2 (IFNB1) induction. Using a comprehensive microscopy\u2010based high\u2010content screening approach combined to the gene silencing of nuclear transport factors, we showed that NS3/4A\u2010interacting proteins control the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF\u2010\u03BAB p65 upon Sendai virus (SeV) infection. Notably, importin \u03B21 (IMP\u03B21) knockdown\u2014a hub protein highly targeted by several viruses\u2014decreases the nuclear translocation of both transcription factors and prevents IFNB1 and IFIT1 induction, correlating with a rapid increased of viral proteins and virus\u2010mediated apoptosis.

Importantly, mutated IMP\u03B21 resistant to cleavage completely restores signaling, similar to the treatment with BILN 2061 protease inhibitor, correlating with the disappearance of cleavage products.

Moreover, microglial cells and astrocytes govern the activity of brain-infiltrating antiviral T-cells through upregulation of PD-L1 expression. While T-cell suppressive responses within brain are undoubtedly beneficial to the host, preventing cytotoxic damage to this vital organ, establishment of a prolonged anti-inflammatory milieu may simultaneously lead to deficiencies in viral clearance. An immune checkpoint blockade targeting the PD-1: PD-L1 (B7-H1; CD274) axis has revolutionized contemporary treatment for a variety of cancers. However, the therapeutic potential of PD1: PD-L1 blockade therapies targeting viral brain reservoirs remains to be determined. For these reasons, it is key to understand both the detrimental and protective functions of this signaling pathway within the brain.

Although many factors regulate ectodermal organogenesis, there is not any report about their functions in real-time study. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), a non-invasive, real-time surveillance system, had been used to detect changes in organ cell layer thickness through quantitative monitoring of the impedance of a cell-to-microelectrode interface over time. It was shown to be a good method for identifying significant real-time changes of cells. The purpose of this study is to establish a combined bioengineered organ-ECIS model for investigating the real time effects of fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) on epithelial invagination in bioengineered ectodermal organs. We dissected epithelial and mesenchymal cells from stage E14.5 murine molar tooth germs and identified the real-time effects of FGF-9 on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions using this combined bioengineered organ-ECIS model. RESULTS: Measurement of bioengineered ectodermal organ thickness showed that Fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) accelerates epithelial invagination in reaggregated mesenchymal cell layer within 3 days. Gene expression analysis revealed that FGF-9 stimulates and sustains early Ameloblastin and Amelogenin expression during odontogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first real-time study to show that, FGF-9 plays an important role in epithelial invagination and initiates ectodermal organogenesis. Based on these findings, we suggest FGF-9 can be applied for further study in ectodermal organ regeneration, and we also proposed that the \u2018FGF-BMP balancing system\u2019 is important for manipulating the morphogenesis of ectodermal organs. The combined bioengineered organ-ECIS model is a promising method for ectodermal organ engineering and regeneration research.","publish_time":"2012-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tai, Yun-Yuan; Chen, Rung-Shu; Lin, Yi; Ling, Thai-Yen; Chen, Min-Huey","journal":"Cell Commun Signal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c19b92f638a71bdf631c296aee8d9fbfd4202034.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3515343.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-811x-10-34; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23176204/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ectodermal organ regeneration","ectodermal organ engineering","Epithelial invagination","bioengineered ectodermal organs","real-time effects of FGF","Measurement of bioengineered ectodermal organ thickness","combined bioengineered organ-ECIS model","real-time study","initiation of ectodermal organogenesis","organ cell layer thickness","morphogenesis of ectodermal organs","epithelial-mesenchymal interactions","FGF-BMP balancing system","real-time surveillance system","reaggregated mesenchymal cell layer","mesenchymal cells","significant real-time changes of cells","important role","real time effects of fibroblast growth factor","Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing","promising method","good method","regeneration research","Amelogenin expression","Gene expression analysis","stage E14","murine molar tooth germs","quantitative monitoring","early Ameloblastin","odontogenesis","days","report","RESULTS","microelectrode interface","functions","BACKGROUND","factors","purpose","CONCLUSIONS","findings"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: We provide evidence suggesting that infectious insults could act as triggers of maladaptive immune responses in BD and that immunogenetic vulnerability may amplify the effects of such environmental risk factors, increasing susceptibility to subsequent environmental encounters.

In recent years, many EIDs have revealed the close links between human, animal and plant health, highlighting the need for multi-scale, multisectorial EID management. Human beings play a dual role in EID because they can promote their development through numerous human-environment interfaces and expanding international trade. On the other hand, their ability to analyze, interpret and act on the determinants of EID allows them to access the expertise necessary to control these EIDs. This expertise must be constantly adapted to remain relevant as the EID evolves, particularly in its virulence or transmission channels. Flexibility should become an inherent part of the expertise-based decision-making process even if it means going backwards. A certain degree of transparency and feedback to citizens is necessary for the acceptability of political decisions basing on expertise. A key step in the management of EID is the appropriate management of the early signal of infectious emergence. This step combines multidisciplinary skills allowing access to the best pathway for containing EID by implementing early countermeasures adapted to the situation. New digital technologies could significantly improve this early detection phase. Finally, experts have a fundamental role to play because they are located at the interface between operational actors and decision-makers, which allows multidirectional feedback, ideally in real time, between professional actors and decision makers.

It can be caused by enteroviruses, particularly Coxsackieviruses and human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) with highly variable clinical manifestations. In the spring of 2008, a large, unprecedented HFMD outbreak in Fuyang city of Anhui province in the central part of southeastern China resulted in a high aggregation of fatal cases. In this study, epidemiologic and clinical investigations, laboratory testing, and genetic analyses were performed to identify the causal pathogen of the outbreak. Of the 6,049 cases reported between 1 March and 9 May of 2008, 3023 (50%) were hospitalized, 353 (5.8%) were severe and 22 (0.36%) were fatal. HEV71 was confirmed as the etiological pathogen of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analyses of entire VP1 capsid protein sequence of 45 Fuyang HEV71 isolates showed that they belong to C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype. In addition, genetic recombinations were found in the 3D region (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a major component of the viral replication complex of the genome) between the Fuyang HEV71 strain and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), resulting in a recombination virus. In conclusion, an emerging recombinant HEV71 was responsible for the HFMD outbreak in Fuyang City of China, 2008.","publish_time":"2010-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yan; Zhu, Zhen; Yang, Weizhong; Ren, Jun; Tan, Xiaojuan; Wang, Yu; Mao, Naiying; Xu, Songtao; Zhu, Shuangli; Cui, Aili; Zhang, Yong; Yan, Dongmei; Li, Qun; Dong, Xiaoping; Zhang, Jing; Zhao, Yueping; Wan, Junfeng; Feng, Zijian; Sun, Junling; Wang, Shiwen; Li, Dexin; Xu, Wenbo","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34dfd4d983484d85d797e915cb47041aeb4ced86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2885340.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20459851/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-94","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFMD"],"locations":["Anhui","China","Fuyang City"],"keyphrases":["Fuyang HEV71 strain","Fuyang HEV71 isolates","Fuyang City of China","unprecedented HFMD outbreak","emerging recombinant HEV71","Fuyang city of Anhui province","variable clinical manifestations","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","Coxsackievirus A16","CV-A16","clinical investigations","mouth disease","southeastern China","genetic recombinations","high aggregation of fatal cases","causal pathogen","etiological pathogen","life-threatening manifestations","common contagious disease","Phylogenetic analyses of entire VP1 capsid protein sequence","major component","laboratory testing","genome","viral replication complex","D region","children","Coxsackieviruses","human enterovirus","foot","C4a cluster","C4 subgenotype","enteroviruses","Hand","study","conclusion","addition","recombination virus","spring"],"language":"en"},

To maintain a low risk of insertional mutagenesis-mediated gene activation, expression-augmenting sequences would ideally function to improve transgene expression from transiently transfected intact plasmid, but not from spurious genomically integrated vectors. We report herein the development of potent minimal, antibiotic-free, high-manufacturing-yield mammalian expression vectors incorporating rationally designed additive combinations of expression enhancers. The SV40 72 bp enhancer incorporated upstream of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer selectively improved extrachromosomal transgene expression. The human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) R region, incorporated downstream of the CMV promoter, dramatically increased mRNA translation efficiency, but not overall mRNA levels, after transient transfection. A similar mRNA translation efficiency increase was observed with plasmid vectors incorporating and expressing the protein kinase R-inhibiting adenoviral viral associated (VA)1 RNA. Strikingly, HTLV-I R and VA1 did not increase transgene expression or mRNA translation efficiency from plasmid DNA after genomic integration. The vector platform, when combined with electroporation delivery, further increased transgene expression and improved HIV-1 gp120 DNA vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers in rabbits. These antibiotic-free vectors incorporating transient expression enhancers are safer, more potent alternatives to improve transgene expression for DNA therapy or vaccination.

The bacterium was safe to mice at a dosage of 2 \u00D7 10(9) CFU, almost eliminated from the spleen and liver at week 4 post-immunization and eventually cleared at week 6. Mice immunized with 1 \u00D7 10(9) CFU of SL7207 (pVAX-M) elicited specific anti-TGEV local mucosal and humoral responses including levels of IgA, IgG, IL-4, and IFN-\u03B3 as measured by indirect ELISA assay. Moreover, the control groups (pVAX group, PBS group) maintained at a normal level during week 4\u20138 post-immunization. The results indicated that attenuated S. typhimurium could be used as a delivery vector for oral immunization of TGEV M gene vaccine.","publish_time":"2016-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qing, Ying; Liu, Jiawen; Huang, Xiaobo; Li, Yaqing; Zhang, Yudi; Chen, Jie; Wen, Xintian; cao, Sanjie; Wen, Yiping; Wu, Rui; Yan, Qigui; Ma, Xiaoping","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11b32fd959131a10c460119368638178a512b2da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088643.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26837896/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-016-1296-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":["PBS","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["typhimurium SL7207","pVAX group","week","recombinant plasmid pVAX","Attenuated Salmonella typhimurium","CFU of SL7207","post-immunization","oral immunization of TGEV","c mice","specific anti-TGEV local mucosal","development of live mucosal vaccines","PBS group","delivery vector","eukaryotic expression vector pVAX1","gene vaccine","humoral responses","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","levels of IgA","control groups","IL","IgG","transgenic vehicle","normal level","spleen","electroporation","IFN-\u03B3","RT-PCR","different dosages","indirect ELISA assay","DNA fragment","glycoprotein","safety","translation","bacterium","BALB","results"],"language":"en"},

The diagnosis was achieved by using a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and highlights the usefulness of these novel molecular diagnostic techniques in patients hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. We also performed a literature search for previously published cases and present a summary of the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old immunocompetent Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital with an acute febrile respiratory illness associated with a rash. Her blood tests were non-specifically abnormal, and tests for bacterial pathogens were negative. Her condition rapidly deteriorated while she was in our hospital and required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. A multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay performed on respiratory specimens to detect respiratory viruses was negative for influenza but positive for adenovirus DNA. The patient recovered on supportive treatment, and antibiotics were stopped after 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adult civilians presents as a non-specific acute febrile respiratory illness followed by the abrupt onset of respiratory failure, often requiring mechanical ventilation. Its laboratory and radiological features are typical of viral infections but also are non-specific. Novel multiplex real-time RT-PCR testing for respiratory viruses enabled us to rapidly make the diagnosis in this case. The new technology could be used more widely in patients with acute respiratory illness and has potential utility for rationalization of the use of antibiotics and improving infection control measures.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clark, Tristan W; Fleet, Daniel H; Wiselka, Martin J","journal":"J Med Case Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/121638b718d18f7bb5086223540f74cf61e49800.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3148995.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-1947-5-259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21718493/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory illness","respiratory viruses","respiratory specimens","non-specific acute febrile respiratory illness","multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay","abrupt onset of respiratory failure","Novel multiplex real-time RT-PCR testing","adenovirus pneumonia","hospital","patients","immunocompetent adult civilians","adenovirus DNA","radiological features","community","laboratory","rare condition","mechanical ventilation","case report","CASE PRESENTATION","diagnosis","multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","use of antibiotics","year-old immunocompetent Caucasian woman","blood tests","novel molecular diagnostic techniques","usefulness","potential utility","rationalization","typical of viral infections","influenza","published cases","summary","bacterial pathogens","infection control measures","inotropic support","literature search","supportive treatment","CONCLUSIONS","rash","INTRODUCTION","new technology","days"],"language":"en"},

In the United States, extensive debate has ensued as to the risk posed by the disease, whether the health system is prepared to manage a high volume of critical cases, whether any number of public health responses are necessary and appropriate, and the appropriate ways to prevent, manage, and treat the pandemic. We hypothesized that the interplay between scientists, policymakers, and the public in an open forum was associated with increased overall public trust in science and scientists, but that this was moderated by political orientation and/or religious commitment. In the context of a public health emergency, it is important to understand the degree to which science and scientists are trusted to produce information that can provide reassurance and also can explain the details of a highly complex event like a viral pandemic while providing actionable recommendations. Methods Data were obtained on March 17-18, 2020, from a sample of 242 US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk users. Respondents completed a 49-question survey consisting of key socidemographic variables, political affiliation, religious commitment, and two iterations of the Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory (one for March 2020, and one for December 2019 using retrospective recall). Changes in mean level of trust and interaction with political affiliation and/or religious commitment were assessed using mixed ANOVA via the general linear model. Results On a scale from 1 (low trust) to 5 (high trust), the mean level of trust in science and scientists was static; 3.82 in December 2019, and 3.81 in March 2020. Conservative political orientation and high religious commitment were associated with significantly less overall trust in science; the interaction effect suggested that liberal trust in science decreased slightly from December 2019 to March 2020, while conservative trust increased slightly. Discussion Counter to our expectations, the overall level of trust in science remained static after the first several months of Covid-19 in the United States, though there is some evidence that political orientation was associated with magnitude and directionality of change in trust. Continued examination of these trends is important for understanding public response to epidemiologic recommendations.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agley, Jon","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1e96edb1d8d74753af6218c18b1c9a2d8ebfdb6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620301578; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620301578?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405095/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.05.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Amazon Mechanical Turk"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["science","overall trust","high trust","conservative trust","liberal trust","low trust","overall level of trust","increased overall public trust","mean level of trust","scientists","high religious commitment","public response","political affiliation","public health emergency","Conservative political orientation","number of public health responses","public social discussion of epidemiology","health system","viral pandemic","United States","subsequent pandemic","interaction effect","open forum","high volume of critical cases","appropriate ways","Discussion Counter","months of Covid","epidemiologic recommendations","actionable recommendations","key socidemographic variables","mixed ANOVA","US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk users","question survey","trends","magnitude","expectations","general linear model","complex event","iterations","extensive debate","recent history","directionality of change","details","sample","Abstract Introduction","emergence","Continued examination","disease","scale","context","policymakers","evidence","Scientist Inventory","Changes","degree","reassurance","risk","Respondents","information","interplay","Methods Data","retrospective recall","Results"],"language":"en"},

Cranial nerve palsies are frequent in Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome. Among cranial nerve palsies in Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome, facial nerve palsy is the most common affecting around half of the cases. Facial palsy in Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome is usually bilateral. We describe a pediatric Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome variant presenting with unilateral peripheral facial palsy and dysphagia. A 5-year-old boy had progressive lower extremity weakness and pain 3 days prior to onset of unilateral peripheral facial palsy. On presentation, diagnosis of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome was supported by areflexia and albuminocytologic dissociation. His condition deteriorated with a decline in his respiratory effort and inability to handle secretions. He was given non-invasive ventilation to prevent worsening of his acute respiratory failure. Brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging scans showed enhancement of the left bulbar nerve complex and anterior and posterior cervical nerve roots with gadolinium. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin led to an uneventful clinical course with partial recovery within 2 weeks. In summary, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome should be considered as a possible cause of unilateral peripheral facial palsy.

However, it is still not known whether viruses are responsible for the symptoms observed in sick pilgrims or whether they only colonize sick and asymptomatic pilgrims. Patients and methods A prospective cohort study was conducted among French Hajj pilgrims in 2016. Medical follow-up and systematic nasal swabbing were performed pre- and post-Hajj. Additional samples were obtained per-Hajj, at symptom onset in ill pilgrims. Viruses were identified using the BioFire FilmArray\u00AE Respiratory multiplex qualitative PCR panel. Results 109 pilgrims were included. 83.5% presented respiratory symptoms during Hajj and 39.5% were still symptomatic on return. 5.5% of pre-Hajj, 95.2% of per-Hajj (at symptom onset) and 46.5% of post-Hajj samples tested positive (p \u003C 0.0001). Acquisition rates of rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus 229E and influenza A virus were respectively 38.6%, 19.8% and 2.0%. Although rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus 229E and influenza A clearance were respectively 70.6%, 71.4% and 100% on return, overall virus carriage proportion on return was 75.0% in pilgrims with influenza-like illness and 44.0% in those who have never experienced this symptoms or resolved it (OR = 4.05, 95% CI [1.02\u201316.02]).

Background Travellers\u2019 compliance with measures to prevent influenza through the use of antivirals and influenza vaccine remains very poor despite influenza being one of the commonest travel and vaccine\u2010preventable diseases. A study was undertaken to assess travellers\u2019 beliefs, perceptions and intentions to take antivirals for the treatment and prevention of influenza during the H1N1 pandemic. Methods A cross\u2010sectional survey (n = 96) of travellers who attended the Royal Free Travel Health Centre, London, UK was undertaken in September 2009. A self\u2010administered questionnaire was completed by a traveller in advance of their pre\u2010travel health consultation. Logistic regression identified variables independently associated with compliance. Results Influenza vaccination uptake for the 5 years preceding the study was found to be 20\u00B78%. This was statistically significantly higher for older travellers and those with underlying health conditions (P \u003C 0\u00B7005). Mean intention to comply with antiviral drugs on a preventive and therapeutic basis was 58% and 72%, respectively, and this varied markedly with age and with dispensed antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Conclusion This study identifies some beliefs and perceptions travellers consider with regard to the therapeutic and preventive influenza use of antivirals during the H1N1 pandemic; it underscores the importance of travellers receiving hemisphere appropriate influenza vaccination. The external validity of these study findings requires further corroboration involving other travel clinics and different cohorts of travellers during seasonal activity or outbreaks of influenza. These findings could guide the development of future strategies for the prevention of influenza in travellers.","publish_time":"2012-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masuet\u2010Aumatell, Cristina; Toovey, Stephen; Zuckerman, Jane N.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e951ff88008de16ecc2aeaecea54ed5b5c84abf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5781004.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22998606/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","Royal Free Travel Health Centre"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Prevention of influenza","influenza vaccine","outbreaks of influenza","perceptions travellers","preventive influenza use of antivirals","importance of travellers","older travellers","hemisphere appropriate influenza vaccination","Results Influenza vaccination uptake","study findings","cross\u2010sectional study","travel clinics","commonest travel","different cohorts of travellers","UK travel clinic","pre\u2010travel health consultation","travellers\u2019 beliefs","Royal Free Travel Health Centre","H1N1 pandemic","underlying health conditions","Background Travellers\u2019 compliance","therapeutic basis","cross\u2010sectional survey","London","seasonal activity","regard","antiviral drugs","advance","corroboration","intentions","measures","development of future strategies","preventable diseases","years","treatment","age","dispensed antimalarial chemoprophylaxis","Mean intention","variables","Methods","Aumatell","external validity","Logistic regression","paper","Masuet","self\u2010administered questionnaire","Respiratory Viruses","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiology has focused on different environmental risk factors but certainly virus infection, smoking, vitamin D levels, and sunlight exposure are the most relevant. What is certainly less clear is the way in which these external factors are able to induce and sustain the internal pathology process of the disease. Epigenetics has been recently focused on trying to shed light on this aspect. As a matter of fact epigenetic changes are highly sensitive to environmental factors that therefore may influence the susceptibility to the disease by acting through epigenetic modifications. In this chapter we discuss the most relevant environmental factors and how they may affect the immune response in MS. Finally, we discuss the possible role of the microbiota in inducing autoimmunity in MS.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trojano, M.; Avolio, C.","journal":"Translational Neuroimmunology in Multiple Sclerosis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45e865433224c553d51f17b449c8d7bff7bd83cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148631.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128019146000088; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128019146000088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relevant environmental factors","external factors","different environmental risk factors","disease","brain pathology","epigenetic modifications","immune response","internal pathology process","chronic activation of immune cells","matter of fact epigenetic changes","virus infection","vitamin D levels","smoking","MS","induction","sunlight exposure","multiple sclerosis","genetic traits","microbiota","possible role","inducing autoimmunity","Abstract","way","Epidemiology","chapter","susceptibility","aspect","Epigenetics"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies have demonstrated that peptides derived from the two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) of paramyxovirus fusion proteins could be used as inhibitors of virus fusion. The mechanism underlying this activity is in accordance with that of class I virus fusion proteins, of which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus fusion proteins are members. For class I virus fusion proteins, the HR1 fragment binds to HR2 to form a six-helix bundle with three HR1 fragments forming the central coiled bundle surrounded by three coiled HR2 fragments in the post fusion conformational state (fusion core). It is hypothesized that the introduced exogenous HR1 or HR2 can compete against their endogenous counterparts, which results in fusion inhibition. Using Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a model, we designed several protein inhibitors, denoted HR212 as well asHR121 and 5-Helix, which could bind the HR1 or HR2 region of fusion protein, respectively. All the proteins were expressed and purified using a GST-fusion expression system in Escherichia coli. The HR212 or GST-HR212 protein, which binds the HR1 peptide in vitro, displayed inhibitory activity against NDV-mediated cell fusion, while the HR121 and 5-Helix proteins, which bind the HR2 peptide in vitro, inhibited virus fusion from the avirulent NDV strain when added before the cleavage of the fusion protein. These results showed that the designed HR212, HR121 or 5-Helix protein could serve as specific antiviral agents. These data provide additional insight into the difference between the virulent and avirulent strains of NDV.","publish_time":"2005-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Jieqing; Jiang, Xiuli; Liu, Yueyong; Tien, Po; Gao, George F.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b7cc2e066ab4f8252246b530424d878b260b108.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094301.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283605011514; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283605011514","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibitors of virus fusion","inhibited virus fusion","fusion core","fusion inhibition","paramyxovirus fusion proteins","influenza virus fusion proteins","HR2 region of fusion protein","Helix proteins","NDV-mediated cell fusion","GST-fusion expression system","HR1 fragments","post fusion conformational state","HR2 peptide","HR1 peptide","GST-HR212 protein","protein inhibitors","coiled HR2 fragments","human immunodeficiency virus","Newcastle disease virus","helix bundle","designed HR212","introduced exogenous HR1","denoted HR212","avirulent NDV strain","avirulent strains of NDV","class","results","central coiled bundle","inhibitory activity","Paramyxovirus infections","specific therapeutic treatments","specific antiviral agents","HIV","difference","vaccines available","Escherichia coli","accordance","heptad","asHR121","cleavage","model","members","additional insight","endogenous counterparts","peptides","data","regions","emerging zoonotic viruses","Recent studies","diseases","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Comparison of RSV and influenza infection in hospitalized older adults may increase awareness of adult RSV disease burden. METHODS: Hospitalized adults aged \u226560 years who tested positive for RSV or influenza between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2015 were identified from Kaiser Permanente Southern California electronic medical records. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, utilization, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: The study included 645 RSV- and 1878 influenza-infected hospitalized adults. Patients with RSV were older than those with influenza (mean, 78.5 vs 77.4 years; P = .035) and more likely to have congestive heart failure (35.3% vs 24.5%; P \u003C .001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (29.8% vs 24.3%; P = .006) at baseline. In adjusted analyses, RSV infection was associated with greater odds of length of stay \u22657 days (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2\u20131.8; P \u003C .001); pneumonia (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.2\u20133.2; P \u003C .001); intensive care unit admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0\u20131.7; P = .023); exacerbation of COPD (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3\u20132.4; P = .001); and greater mortality within 1 year of admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0\u20131.6; P = .019).

First ACE2 has emerged as a potent negative regulator of the RAS counterbalancing the multiple functions of ACE. By targeting angiotensin II ACE2 exhibits a protective role in the cardiovascular system and many other organs. Second ACE2 was identified as an essential receptor for the SARS coronavirus that causes severe acute lung failure. Downregulation of ACE2 strongly contributes to the pathogenesis of severe lung failure. Third, both ACE2 and its homologue Collectrin can associate with amino acid transporters and play essential role in the absorption of amino acids in the kidney and gut. In this review, we will discuss the multiple biological functions of ACE2.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuba, Keiji; Imai, Yumiko; Ohto-Nakanishi, Takayo; Penninger, Josef M.","journal":"Pharmacology \u0026 Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02d18b4f484a0420c21595a95b8765125d4a484c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112678.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20599443/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.06.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725810001415; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725810001415","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS","ACE","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cloning of ACE2","Downregulation of ACE2","major ACE2 functions","multiple biological functions of ACE2","angiotensin system","multiple functions of ACE","Abstract Angiotensin","essential role","RAS","carboxypeptidase ACE","severe acute lung failure","pathogenesis of severe lung failure","protective role","essential receptor","cardiovascular system","amino acid transporters","absorption of amino acids","SARS coronavirus","main active peptide of renin","homologue Collectrin","kidney","potent negative regulator","gut","enzyme","organs","review"],"language":"en"},

Starting in March 2014, a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, many of which were acquired in health care settings. As of May 9, 2014, 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally. Methods Review of publicly available data about MERS-CoV health care\u2013associated transmission. Results We identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care\u2013associated transmission with high morbidity and mortality, mainly among patients with comorbidities. Health care workers are also frequently affected; however, they tend to have milder symptoms and better prognosis. Gaps in infection control were noted in all events. Currently, health care\u2013associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusion There is a need to increase infection control capacity in affected areas and areas at increased risk of being affected to prevent transmission in health care settings. Vaccines and antiviral agents are urgently needed. Overall, our knowledge about the epidemiologic characteristics of MERS-CoV that impact health care transmission is very limited. As the MERS-CoV epidemic continues to evolve, issues concerning best infection control measures will arise, and studies to better define their effectiveness in real life are needed.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maltezou, Helena C.; Tsiodras, Sotirios","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75c449ce799f8e2c627894620b85c4c349463036.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132773.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465253/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655314009316; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2014.06.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655314009316","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Background Middle East","Arabian Peninsula"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV health care","confirmed health care","health care settings","Health care workers","impact health care transmission","MERS-CoV epidemic","associated transmission","affected areas","epidemiologic characteristics of MERS","infection control capacity","associated outbreaks","best infection control measures","Arabian Peninsula","dramatic increase of cases","high morbidity","novel coronavirus","events of possible","better prognosis","severe respiratory disease","Background Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","high case fatality rate","mortality","issues","available data","evolution","countries","pivotal role","increased risk","need","effectiveness","patients","milder symptoms","studies","knowledge","Vaccines","antiviral agents","real life","comorbidities","Methods","laboratory","deaths","Gaps","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

BACKGROUND: Since 2012, more than 2425 MERS\u2010CoV human cases have been reported in 27 countries. The infection causes acute respiratory disease, which was responsible for 838 deaths in these countries, mainly in Saudi Arabia. Viral genomic RNA was detected in whole blood, serum and plasma of infected patients, raising concerns of the safety of blood supplies, especially in endemic areas. METHODS: Four apheresis platelet units in 100% plasma were inoculated with a clinical MERS\u2010CoV isolate. Spiked units were then treated with amotosalen/UVA to inactivate MERS\u2010CoV. Infectious and genomic viral titres were quantified by plaque assay and quantitative real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010qPCR). Inactivated samples were successively passaged thrice on Vero E6 cells to exclude the presence of residual replication\u2010competent viral particles in inactivated platelets. RESULTS: Complete inactivation of MERS\u2010CoV in spiked platelet units was achieved by treatment with Amotosalen/UVA light with a mean log reduction of 4\u00B748 \u00B1 0\u00B73. Passaging of the inactivated samples in Vero E6 showed no viral replication even after nine days of incubation and three passages. Viral genomic RNA titration in inactivated samples showed titres comparable to those in pre\u2010treatment samples. CONCLUSION: Amotosalen and UVA light treatment of MERS\u2010CoV\u2010spiked platelet concentrates efficiently and completely inactivated MERS\u2010CoV infectivity (\u003E4 logs), suggesting that such treatment could minimise the risk of transfusion\u2010related MERS\u2010CoV transmission.","publish_time":"2019-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hashem, A.

It has been demonstrated that herds can remain free from these infections for several years also in high prevalence areas. Organically managed (OM) dairy herds have been shown to have lower seroprevalence of both viruses compared to conventionally managed (CM) herds. The objective of this study was to challenge the hypothesis of a lower occurrence of BRSV and BoCV in OM compared to CM dairy herds. In November 2011, May 2012 and May 2013 milk samples from four homebred primiparous cows were collected in 75 to 65 OM and 69 to 62 CM herds. The antibody status regarding BRSV and BoCV was analysed with commercial indirect ELISAs. Herds were classified as positive if at least one individual sample was positive. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive herds ranged from 73.4% to 82.3% for BRSV and from 76.8% to 85.3% for BoCV among OM and CM herds, over the three sampling occasions. There was no statistically significant difference between OM and CM herds at any sampling occasion. The incidence risk of newly infected herds did not differ statistically between OM and CM herds at any sampling occasion, neither for BRSV nor for BoCV. The incidence of herds turning sero-negative between samplings corresponded to the incidence of newly infected. Bulk tank milk (BTM) samples were also sampled in the herds and analysed. Several herds were negative on individual samples but positive in BTM. Herd-level data on production, health and reproduction were retrieved from V\u00C4XA Sweden and the study herds were representative of the source population. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in prevalence of or incidence risk for BRSV or BoCV between Swedish OM and CM herds. Because the incidence of herds becoming seropositive was balanced by herds becoming seronegative it should be possible to lower the prevalence of these two infections among Swedish dairy cattle herds if biosecurity is improved.

For the first time, an Ebola epidemic of exceptional magnitude dramatically engulfed several countries in West Africa since December 2013. Major failures of implementing measures to prevent human-to-human transmissions are the main cause of this large-scale Ebola outbreak. After about one-week incubation period, the Ebola virus disease is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever leading to multiple hemorrhages and to widespread organ failure. Several bat species constitute the main reservoirs of Ebola viruses. Human contamination would occur either directly from bats, widely consumed by the local populations, or through animal species susceptible to Ebola infection, such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Alongside this \u201Cnatural cycle\u201D, an \u201Cepidemic cycle\u201D involving domestic animals living in villages such as dogs or pigs, is seriously suggested. Thus, according to the diversity of concerned animals and their clinical infection form, modalities of human contamination can be multiple and are still largely unknown. In this context, all efforts that could be made to unravel the mystery of the Ebola virus emergence in humans and clarify modalities of the virus transmission, would allow for predicting or for anticipating the future occurrence of epidemics. This review aims to provide an exhaustive inventory of the Ebola ecology to highlight events governing the virus transmission to humans that still remain unsolved.","publish_time":"2015-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leroy, \u00C9ric Maurice","journal":"Bulletin de l\u0027Acad\u00E9mie Nationale de M\u00E9decine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b7671a0b043ced5d1a4afa2f3f304977b004141.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095178.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407919309409; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407919309409","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Central Africa","West Africa","Ebola"],"keyphrases":["Ebola infection","Ebola virus disease","Ebola virus emergence","Ebola ecology","virus transmission","large-scale Ebola outbreak","Ebola epidemic of exceptional magnitude","main reservoirs of Ebola viruses","modalities of human contamination","human transmissions","humans","epidemic cycle","multiple hemorrhages","main cause","domestic animals","bat species","Central Africa","West Africa","natural cycle","clinical infection form","animal species susceptible","diversity of concerned animals","small deadly outbreaks","sudden onset of high fever","events","week incubation period","villages","countries","widespread organ failure","local populations","exhaustive inventory","dogs","measures","chimpanzees","time","mystery","Major failures","future occurrence of epidemics","pigs","review","bats","gorillas","SUMMARY","context","efforts","months"],"language":"en"},

Probiotic bacteria are effective in macrophage activation and may have antiviral activities. Objective This study aimed at verifying the direct effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, a probiotic bacterium, in comparison with Escherichia coli, a non-probiotic one, on HSV-1 infection, and determining its effect on macrophage activation for in vitro elimination of HSV-1 infection. Methods The above bacteria were introduced into HSV-1 infected Vero cells, and their effects were examined using both MTT and plaque assay. To determine macrophage activation against in vitro HSV-1 infection, J774 cells were exposed to these bacteria; then, macrophage viability was examined with the MTT method, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03B1), Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03B3), and nitric oxide (NO) assessments were performed using the ELISA method. Results A significant increased viability of macrophages was observed (p\u003C0.05) in the presence of Lactobacillus rhamnosus before and after HSV-1 infection when compared with Escherichia coli as a non-probiotic bacterium. However, tumor necrosis factor \u03B1 concentration produced by Escherichia coli-treated J774 cells was significantly higher than Lactobacillus rhamnosus-treated J774 cells (p\u003C0.05). Interferon-gamma and NO production were not different in the groups treated with Escherichia coli or with Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Conclusion The results of this study indicate that Lactobacillus rhamnosus enhances macrophage viability for HSV-1 elimination and activation against HSV-1 more effectively, when compared with non-probiotic Escherichia coli. It also seems that receptor occupation of macrophage sites decreases HSV-1 infectivity by both of the studied bacteria.","publish_time":"2012-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khani, Soghra; Motamedifar, Mohammad; Golmoghaddam, Hossein; Hosseini, Hamideh Mahmoodzadeh; Hashemizadeh, Zahra","journal":"The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7cfa8fb9b1e09084cbc9e3a56092c6015704995e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1413867012702933; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1413867012702933","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia"],"organizations":["MTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elimination of HSV","macrophage activation","non-probiotic Escherichia coli","macrophage viability","Probiotic bacteria","Escherichia coli-treated J774 cells","Lactobacillus rhamnosus-treated J774 cells","presence of Lactobacillus rhamnosus","non-probiotic bacterium","direct effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus","studied bacteria","receptor occupation of macrophage sites","herpes simplex virus type","infected Vero cells","MTT method","study","Interferon-gamma","methods","results","tumor necrosis factor \u03B1 concentration","tumor necrosis factor alpha","TNF-\u03B1","significant increased viability of macrophages","ELISA method","emergence of drug resistance","infectivity","comparison","IFN-\u03B3","assessments","production","effects","infections","groups","nitric oxide","antiviral activities","Abstract Background","plaque assay","Conclusion","researchers","Objective"],"language":"en"},

The extent of commensal overgrowth and agreement of BAL with DNS culture results in preweaned calves are unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare commensal overgrowth and bacterial culture results between DNS and BAL samples. ANIMALS: A total of 183 preweaned calves (144 with bovine respiratory disease and 39 healthy animals). METHODS: Cross\u2010sectional study. Deep nasopharyngeal swab and BAL samples were taken from each calf and cultured to detect Pasteurellaceae and Mycoplasma bovis. Agreement and associations between culture results of DNS and BAL samples were determined by kappa statistics and logistic regression. RESULTS: Bronchoalveolar lavage samples were less often polymicrobial, more frequently negative and yielded more pure cultures compared to DNS, leading to a clinically interpretable culture result in 79.2% of the cases compared to only in 31.2% of the DNS samples. Isolation rates were lower in healthy animals, but not different between DNS and BAL samples. Only Histophilus somni was more likely to be isolated from BAL samples. In clinical cases, a polymicrobial DNS culture result did not increase the probability of a polymicrobial BAL result by \u226530%, nor did it influence the probability of a negative culture. A significant herd effect was noted for all observed relationships. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Nonendoscopic BAL samples are far less overgrown by bacteria compared to DNS samples under the conditions of this study, facilitating clinical interpretation and resulting in a higher return on investment in bacteriologic culturing.","publish_time":"2017-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Driessche, L.; Valgaeren, B.R.; Gille, L.; Boyen, F.; Ducatelle, R.; Haesebrouck, F.; Deprez, P.; Pardon, B.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7af72db19cf1096560e19d5265dc5783ea8dc2cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5435039.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28425146/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.14668","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNS samples","Nonendoscopic BAL samples","DNS culture results","culture results of DNS","agreement of BAL","polymicrobial DNS culture result","polymicrobial BAL result","Bronchoalveolar lavage samples","negative culture","bacterial culture results","interpretable culture result","preweaned calves","healthy animals","clinical cases","CLINICAL RELEVANCE","Nonendoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage","deep nasopharyngeal swab","clinical interpretation","probability","large number of calves","extent of commensal overgrowth","Cross\u2010sectional study","higher return","bovine respiratory disease","practical alternative","kappa statistics","investment","bacteriologic culturing","short period of time","Isolation rates","airways","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","conditions","associations","Pasteurellaceae","significant herd effect","logistic regression","pure cultures","total","calf","observed relationships","Mycoplasma bovis","Histophilus somni","METHODS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

However, the neurological manifestations of MERS have rarely been reported since it first emerged in 2012. METHODS: We evaluated four patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS coronavirus (CoV) infections who showed neurological complications during MERS treatment. These 4 patients were from a cohort of 23 patients who were treated at a single designated hospital during the 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea. The clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and prognoses are described. RESULTS: Four of the 23 admitted MERS patients reported neurological symptoms during or after MERS-CoV treatment. The potential diagnoses in these four cases included Bickerstaff\u0027s encephalitis overlapping with Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome, intensive-care-unit-acquired weakness, or other toxic or infectious neuropathies. Neurological complications did not appear concomitantly with respiratory symptoms, instead being delayed by 2\u20133 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromuscular complications are not rare during MERS treatment, and they may have previously been underdiagnosed. Understanding the neurological manifestations is important in an infectious disease such as MERS, because these symptoms are rarely evaluated thoroughly during treatment, and they may interfere with the prognosis or require treatment modification.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Jee-Eun; Heo, Jae-Hyeok; Kim, Hye-ok; Song, Sook-hee; Park, Sang-Soon; Park, Tai-Hwan; Ahn, Jin-Young; Kim, Min-Ky; Choi, Jae-Phil","journal":"J Clin Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/433c16daf21bb7f5f0d6379d67fe0917c2aa0281.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5532318.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3988/jcn.2017.13.3.227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28748673/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Republic of Korea"],"keyphrases":["MERS treatment","neurological manifestations of MERS","MERS-CoV treatment","MERS coronavirus","admitted MERS patients","neurological complications","neurological symptoms","treatment modification","respiratory symptoms","Neuromuscular complications","Middle East respiratory syndrome","laboratory findings","infectious disease","pandemic potential","infectious neuropathies","potential diagnoses","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","infections","high mortality rate","outbreak","Bickerstaff\u0027s encephalitis","cases","intensive-care","PURPOSE","weakness","unit","BACKGROUND","clinical presentations","single designated hospital","prognoses","CONCLUSIONS","Republic of Korea","prognosis","cohort","RESULTS","METHODS","weeks"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the structural basis of its cleavage specificity, we performed the first crystallographic structural analysis of non-covalent complexes of a picornavirus 3C(pro) with peptide substrates. The X-ray crystal structure of the foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C(pro), mutated to replace the catalytic Cys by Ala and bound to a peptide (APAKQ|LLNFD) corresponding to the P5\u2013P5\u2032 region of the VP1-2A cleavage junction in the viral polyprotein, was determined up to 2.5 \u00C5 resolution. Comparison with free enzyme reveals significant conformational changes in 3C(pro) on substrate binding that lead to the formation of an extended interface of contact primarily involving the P4\u2013P2\u2032 positions of the peptide. Strikingly, the deep S1\u2032 specificity pocket needed to accommodate P1\u2032-Leu only forms when the peptide binds. Substrate specificity was investigated using peptide cleavage assays to show the impact of amino acid substitutions within the P5\u2013P4\u2032 region of synthetic substrates. The structure of the enzyme\u2013peptide complex explains the marked substrate preferences for particular P4, P2 and P1 residue types, as well as the relative promiscuity at P3 and on the P\u2032 side of the scissile bond. Furthermore, crystallographic analysis of the complex with a modified VP1-2A peptide (APAKE|LLNFD) containing a Gln-to-Glu substitution reveals an identical mode of peptide binding and explains the ability of foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C(pro) to cleave sequences containing either P1-Gln or P1-Glu. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to probe interactions within the S1\u2032 specificity pocket and to provide direct evidence of the important contribution made by Asp84 of the Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad to proteolytic activity.

This work explores how protein states can be manipulated through controllability analysis: the determination of the minimum manipulation needed to drive the cell system to any desired state. Here, we complete a two-part controllability analysis of two protein networks: a host network representing the healthy cell state and an influenza A virus-host network representing the infected cell state. In this context, controllability analyses aim to identify key regulating host factors of the infected cell\u2019s progression. This knowledge can be utilized in further biological analysis to understand disease dynamics and isolate proteins for study as drug target candidates. RESULTS: Both topological and controllability analyses provide evidence of wide-reaching network effects stemming from the addition of viral-host protein interactions. Virus interacting and driver host proteins are significant both topologically and in controllability, therefore playing important roles in cell behavior during infection. Functional analysis finds overlap of results with previous siRNA studies of host factors involved in influenza replication, NF-kB pathway and infection relevance, and roles as interferon regulating genes. 24 proteins are identified as holding regulatory roles specific to the infected cell by measures of topology, controllability, and functional role. These proteins are recommended for further study as potential antiviral drug targets. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal outbreaks of influenza A virus are a major cause of illness and death around the world each year with a constant threat of pandemic infection. This research aims to increase the efficiency of antiviral drug target discovery using existing protein-protein interaction data and network analysis methods. These results are beneficial to future studies of influenza virus, both experimental and computational, and provide evidence that the combination of topology and controllability analyses may be valuable for future efforts in drug target discovery.

Our objective was to assess the clinical severity of human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus that has recently emerged in China. METHODS: Among laboratory-confirmed cases of A(H7N9) who were hospitalised, we estimated the risk of fatality, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the intensive care unit based on censored data during the currently ongoing outbreak. We also used information on laboratory-confirmed cases detected through sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance to estimate the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections to date and the symptomatic case fatality risk. FINDINGS: Among 123 hospitalised cases, 37 cases had died and 69 had recovered by May 28, 2013. Hospitalised cases had high risks of mortality (36%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 26%\u201345%), mechanical ventilation or mortality (69%; 95% CI: 60%\u201377%), and ICU admission or mechanical ventilation or mortality (83%; 95% CI: 76%\u201390%), and the risk of these severe outcomes increased with age. Depending on assumptions about the coverage of the sentinel ILI network and health-care seeking behavior for cases of ILI associated with A(H7N9) virus infection, we estimated that the symptomatic case fatality risk could be between 160 and 2,800 per 100,000 symptomatic cases. INTERPRETATION: We estimated that the severity of A(H7N9) is somewhat lower than A(H5N1) but higher than seasonal influenza viruses and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The estimated risks of fatality among hospitalised cases and symptomatic cases are measures of severity that should not be affected by shifts over time in the probability of laboratory-confirmation of mild cases and should inform risk assessment.

Despite the recent advent of anti-HCV direct acting antivirals (DAAs), the treatment of HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients remains a challenge, as these patients are refractory to most therapies and develop liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver cancer more often than HCV mono-infected patients. Until the present study, there was no suitable in vitro assay to test the inhibitory activity of drugs on HCV/HIV-1 co-infection. Here we developed a novel in vitro \u201Cco-infection\u201D model where HCV and HIV-1 concurrently replicate in their respective main host target cells\u2014human hepatocytes and CD4\u002B T-lymphocytes. Using this co-culture model, we demonstrate that cyclophilin inhibitors (CypI), including a novel cyclosporin A (CsA) analog, CPI-431-32, simultaneously inhibits replication of both HCV and HIV-1 when added pre- and post-infection. In contrast, the HIV-1 protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the HCV NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir only blocks the replication of a single virus in the \u201Cco-infection\u201D system. CPI-431-32 efficiently inhibits HCV and HIV-1 variants, which are normally resistant to DAAs. CPI-431-32 is slightly, but consistently more efficacious than the most advanced clinically tested CypI\u2014alisporivir (ALV)\u2014at interrupting an established HCV/HIV-1 co-infection. The superior antiviral efficacy of CPI-431-32 over ALV correlates with its higher potency inhibition of cyclophilin A (CypA) isomerase activity and at preventing HCV NS5A-CypA and HIV-1 capsid-CypA interactions known to be vital for replication of the respective viruses. Moreover, we obtained evidence that CPI-431-32 prevents the cloaking of both the HIV-1 and HCV genomes from cellular sensors. Based on these results, CPI-431-32 has the potential, as a single agent or in combination with DAAs, to inhibit both HCV and HIV-1 infections.","publish_time":"2015-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gallay, Philippe A.; Bobardt, Michael D.; Chatterji, Udayan; Trepanier, Daniel J.; Ure, Daren; Ordonez, Cosme; Foster, Robert","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1ec4b6e87336c52de81d77c06e8d40bcbc15b29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4532424.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26263487/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV/HIV","HCV","ALV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV","mortality of HCV","HCV genomes","treatment of HCV","established HCV","HCV NS5A-CypA","co-infection","HCV mono-infected patients","HCV NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir","HCV-related liver disease","co-infected patients","co-culture model","DAAs","replication","post-infection","recent advent of anti-HCV direct acting antivirals","superior antiviral efficacy of CPI","liver cancer","liver fibrosis","capsid-CypA interactions","isomerase activity","ALV correlates","tested CypI","cyclophilin inhibitors","single agent","single virus","respective viruses","novel cyclosporin","respective main host target cells","main cause of morbidity","protease inhibitor nelfinavir","inhibitory activity of drugs","higher potency inhibition of cyclophilin","human hepatocytes","CD4","cirrhosis","therapies","challenge","alisporivir","CsA","analog","T-lymphocytes","assay","combination","cellular sensors","variants","present study","potential","contrast","system","infections","evidence","results","cloaking"],"language":"en"},

Social distancing measures in informal settlements may be difficult to implement due to the density and layout of settlements. This study measures the distance between dwellings in informal settlements in Cape Town to identify the risk of COVID-19 transmission. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to determine if social distancing measures are achievable in informal settlements in Cape Town, using two settlements as an example. We will first examine the distance between dwellings and their first, second, and third nearest neighbors and then identify clusters of dwellings in which residents would be unable to effectively practice social isolation due to the close proximity of their homes. METHODS: Dwellings in the settlements of Masiphumelele and Klipfontein Glebe were extracted from a geographic information system data set of outlines of all informal dwellings in Cape Town. The distance to each dwelling\u2019s first, second, and third nearest neighbors was calculated for each settlement. A social distance measure of 2 m was used (buffer of 1 m, as dwellings less than 2 m apart are joined) to identify clusters of dwellings that are unable to effectively practice social distancing in each settlement. RESULTS: The distance to each dwelling\u2019s first 3 nearest neighbors illustrates that the settlement of Masiphumelele is constructed in a denser fashion as compared to the Klipfontein Glebe settlement. This implies that implementing social distancing will likely be more challenging in Masiphumelele than in Klipfontein Glebe. However, using a 2-m social distancing measure, it was demonstrated that large portions of Klipfontein Glebe would also be unable to effectively implement social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Effectively implementing social distancing may be a challenge in informal settlements due to their density. This paper uses dwelling outlines for informal settlements in the city of Cape Town to demonstrate that with a 2 m measure, effective social distancing will be challenging.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibson, Lesley; Rush, David","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141253.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32250283/; https://doi.org/10.2196/18844","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Klipfontein Glebe"],"locations":["Cape Town"],"keyphrases":["informal dwellings","Social distancing measures","effective social distancing","settlements of Masiphumelele","social distance measure","presence of informal settlements","social isolation","layout of settlements","clusters of dwellings","Klipfontein Glebe settlement","settlement of Masiphumelele","city of Cape Town","nearest neighbors","large portions of Klipfontein Glebe","paper","dwelling\u2019s","density","dwelling outlines","risk of COVID","geographic information system data set of outlines","Global South","coronavirus disease","close proximity","denser fashion","challenges","formalized sanitation infrastructure","pandemic","residents","homes","OBJECTIVE","aim","transmission","RESULTS","study","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","buffer","example"],"language":"en"},

However, sampling of the airways poses a significant challenge, particularly in infants and children. Here, we report a reliable method for obtaining nasal epithelial cell RNA from infants for genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, and describe baseline expression characteristics in an asymptomatic cohort. Nasal epithelial cells were collected by brushing of the inferior turbinates, and gene expression was interrogated by RNA-seq analysis. Reliable recovery of RNA occurred in the absence of adverse events. We observed high expression of epithelial cell markers and similarity to the transcriptome for intrapulmonary airway epithelial cells. We identified genes displaying low and high expression variability, both inherently, and in response to environmental exposures. The greatest gene expression differences in this asymptomatic cohort were associated with the presence of known pathogenic viruses and/or bacteria. Robust bacteria-associated gene expression patterns were significantly associated with the presence of Moraxella. In summary, we have developed a reliable method for interrogating the infant airway transcriptome by sampling the nasal epithelium. Our data demonstrates both the fidelity and feasibility of our methodology, and describes normal gene expression and variation within a healthy infant cohort.","publish_time":"2016-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Chin-Yi; Qiu, Xing; Wang, Lu; Bhattacharya, Soumyaroop; Lofthus, Gerry; Corbett, Anthony; Holden-Wiltse, Jeanne; Grier, Alex; Tesini, Brenda; Gill, Steven R.; Falsey, Ann R.; Caserta, Mary T.; Walsh, Edward E.; Mariani, Thomas J.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/669511bfee375dd73d141c494f53d027c903f734.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5034274.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep33994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27658638/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["normal gene expression","high expression variability","Nasal epithelial cells","greatest gene expression differences","high expression of epithelial cell markers","baseline expression characteristics","nasal epithelial cell RNA","Robust bacteria-associated gene expression patterns","intrapulmonary airway epithelial cells","asymptomatic cohort","reliable method","Reliable recovery of RNA","infants","infant airway transcriptome","RNA-seq analysis","healthy infant cohort","nasal epithelium","resident cells","sampling","presence of Moraxella","genome-wide transcriptomic analysis","similarity","variation","methodology","key role","significant challenge","genes","severity of respiratory disease","fidelity","feasibility","airways","absence of adverse events","Responses","pathogenic viruses","inferior turbinates","environmental exposures","data","children","summary"],"language":"en"},

Birds and swine are considered major reservoirs of viral genetic diversity, whereas equines and canines have historically been restricted to one or two stable IAV lineages with no transmission to humans. Here, by sequencing the complete genomes of 16 IAVs obtained from canines in southern China (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region [Guangxi]) in 2013 to 2015, we demonstrate that the evolution of canine influenza viruses (CIVs) in Asian dogs is increasingly complex, presenting a potential threat to humans. First, two reassortant H1N1 virus genotypes were introduced independently from swine into canines in Guangxi, including one genotype associated with a zoonotic infection. The genomes contain segments from three lineages that circulate in swine in China: North American triple reassortant H3N2, Eurasian avian-like H1N1, and pandemic H1N1. Furthermore, the swine-origin H1N1 viruses have transmitted onward in canines and reassorted with the CIV-H3N2 viruses that circulate endemically in Asian dogs, producing three novel reassortant CIV genotypes (H1N1r, H1N2r, and H3N2r [r stands for reassortant]). CIVs from this study were collected primarily from pet dogs presenting with respiratory symptoms at veterinary clinics, but dogs in Guangxi are also raised for meat, and street dogs roam freely, creating a more complex ecosystem for CIV transmission. Further surveillance is greatly needed to understand the full genetic diversity of CIV in southern China, the nature of viral emergence and persistence in the region\u2019s diverse canine populations, and the zoonotic risk as the viruses continue to evolve.","publish_time":"2018-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ying; Trov\u00E3o, N\u00EDdia S.; Wang, Guojun; Zhao, Weifeng; He, Ping; Zhou, Huabo; Mo, Yanning; Wei, Zuzhang; Ouyang, Kang; Huang, Weijian; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo; Nelson, Martha I.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e545b25250d9239c3096fa6925fad84c88199cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5989073.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00909-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29871917/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIV"],"locations":["Guangxi"],"keyphrases":["canines","CIV-H3N2 viruses","Asian dogs","swine-origin H1N1 viruses","humans","pet dogs","CIV transmission","street dogs","pandemic H1N1","novel reassortant CIV genotypes","reassortant H1N1 virus genotypes","genetic diversity of CIV","southern China","evolution of canine influenza viruses","IAVs","CIVs","North American triple reassortant H3N2","Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region","ongoing pandemic threat","major reservoirs of viral genetic diversity","zoonotic risk","capacity of influenza","complex ecosystem","zoonotic infection","potential threat","complete genomes","nature of viral emergence","stable IAV lineages","region\u2019s diverse canine populations","persistence","jump","H1N2r","H1N1r","respiratory symptoms","veterinary clinics","animal reservoir species","H3N2r","equines","Birds","study","meat","segments","surveillance"],"language":"en"},

Diseases such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian influenza cause economic losses at the global level and jeopardize diplomatic relations between countries. As wildlife are the source of at least 70% of all emerging diseases and given the on-going concerns associated with wildlife trade as a disease transmission mechanism, we provide a \u2018global snapshot\u2019 of the legal trade in live wild animals and take stock of the potential health risks that it poses to global human health. Our analysis showed that 11,569,796 individual live wild animals, representing 1316 different species were exported from 189 different countries between 2012 and 2016. China was the largest exporter of live mammals (with 98,979 animals representing 58.7% of global trade). Nicaragua was the largest exporter of live amphibians (with 122,592 animals representing 53.8% of global trade). South Africa was the largest exporter of live birds (with 889,607 animals representing 39.2% of global trade). Peru was the largest exporter of live reptiles (with 1,675,490 animals representing 18.8% of global trade). Our analysis showed that mostly the USA and other high-income countries, the largest importers, drive the live animal trade. High-income countries and not the countries where wildlife diseases and pathogens are more likely to occur reported almost all of the disease reports to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Based on our findings, we discuss how maximising trade bans; working on human behaviour change and improving regulatory efforts to improve surveillance will decrease the risk of future pandemics, epidemics and outbreaks.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Can, \u00D6zg\u00FCn Emre; D\u0027Cruze, Neil; Macdonald, David W.","journal":"Global Ecology and Conservation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/643a9b94284750950a78d1ba578f717d756e215b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104232.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989418302312; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351989418302312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289050/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2018.e00515","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA","World Organisation for Animal Health"],"locations":["China","Nicaragua","South Africa","Peru"],"keyphrases":["global trade","live animal trade","wildlife trade","legal trade","largest exporter of live mammals","largest exporter of live amphibians","largest exporter of live birds","largest exporter of live reptiles","individual live wild animals","global level","global human health","global snapshot","wildlife diseases","different countries","high-income countries","maximising trade bans","largest importers","emerging diseases","Animal Health","analysis","Abstract Zoonotic diseases cause millions of deaths","potential health risks","human behaviour","different species","disease reports","disease transmission mechanism","avian influenza cause economic losses","SARS","severe acute respiratory syndrome","stock","Ebola","World Organisation","on-going concerns","risk of future pandemics","epidemics","surveillance","regulatory efforts","year","diplomatic relations","pathogens","South Africa","outbreaks","USA","China","Nicaragua","Peru","findings","source"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey assessing self-reported compliance and its behavioural correlates. SETTING: Internships of medical students in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 322 medical students of the Erasmus Medical Center were recruited over a period of 12 months during the Public Health internship, which is the final compulsory internship after an 18-month rotation schedule in all major specialities. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Behavioural factors influencing compliance to hand hygiene guidelines were measured by means of a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Social Ecological Models. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the effect of including attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, knowledge, risk perception and habit on hand hygiene compliance. RESULTS: We included 313 students in the analysis (response rate 97%). The behavioural model explained 40% of the variance in self-reported compliance (adjusted R(2)=0.40). Hand hygiene compliance was strongly influenced by attitudes (perceived outcomes of preventive actions), self-efficacy (perception of the ability to perform hand hygiene at the clinical ward) and habit, but was not associated with knowledge and risk perception.

Therefore effective prevention and treatment of RTIs remain a high priority worldwide. Preclinical and clinical data highlight the rationale for the use and effectiveness of immunity\u2010targeted approaches, including targeted immunisations and non\u2010specific immunomodulation in the prevention and management of recurrent upper RTIs. OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: The idea of this review was to summarise the current evidence and address key questions concerning the use of conservative and immunity\u2010targeted approaches to recurrent and chronic URTIs, with a focus on the paediatric population. SEARCH STRATEGY/EVALUATION METHOD: Literature searches were conducted in March 2017 and updated in September 2017 using: Academic Search Complete; CENTRAL; Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition; MEDLINE; clinicaltrials.gov; and Cochrane databases. In total, 84 articles were retrieved and reviewed. Two independent researchers focused on primary and secondary endpoints in systematic reviews, meta\u2010analyses and randomised, controlled trials, using immunity\u2010directed strategies as the control group or within a subpopulation of larger studies. Existing guidelines and interventional/observational studies on novel applications were also included. RESULTS: Children are particularly susceptible to RTIs due to the relative immaturity of their immune systems, as well as other potential predisposing factors such as day care attendance and/or toxic environmental factors (eg increased pathogenic microbial exposure and air pollutants). Recurrent URTIs can affect otherwise healthy children, leading to clinical sequelae and complications, including the development of chronic conditions or the need for surgery. Available pre\u2010clinical and clinical data highlight the rationale for the use and effectiveness of immunity\u2010targeted approaches, including targeted immunisations (flu and pneumococcal vaccines) and non\u2010specific immunomodulation (bacterial lysates), in the prevention and management of recurrent croup, tonsillitis, otitis media, recurrent acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we summarise the current evidence and provide data demonstrating that some immunity\u2010targeted strategies, including vaccination and immunomodulation, have proved effective in the treatment and prevention of recurrent and chronic URTIs in children.","publish_time":"2019-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feleszko, Wojciech; Marengo, Ricardo; Vieira, Antonio Sousa; Ratajczak, Karol; Mayorga Butr\u00F3n, Jos\u00E9 Luis","journal":"Clin Otolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc343b504f04146857602c5800c99ab7d08162d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6850198.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920131/; https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13335","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["clinicaltrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevention of recurrent","Recurrent URTIs","targeted approaches","targeted immunisations","targeted strategies","chronic URTIs","effectiveness of immunity","clinical data","management of recurrent upper RTIs","recurrent acute rhinosinusitis","management of recurrent croup","chronic rhinosinusitis","effective prevention","non\u2010specific immunomodulation","clinical sequelae","treatment of RTIs","healthy children","tonsillitis","otitis media","use of conservative","rationale","development of chronic conditions","total respiratory infections","current evidence","OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW","Upper respiratory tract infections","Academic Search Complete","observational studies","SEARCH STRATEGY","Academic Edition","toxic environmental factors","potential predisposing factors","subpopulation of larger studies","meta\u2010analyses","Health Source","secondary endpoints","systematic reviews","day care attendance","pneumococcal vaccines","pathogenic microbial exposure","Nursing","flu","controlled trials","MEDLINE","EVALUATION METHOD","key questions","rhinitis","nasopharyngitis","vaccination","Literature searches","relative immaturity","bacterial lysates","air pollutants","Existing guidelines","novel applications","need","control group","BACKGROUND","focus","complications","immune systems","independent researchers","surgery","high priority","idea","paediatric population","Cochrane databases","RESULTS","articles","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. SETTING: Nationwide general population in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. RESULTS: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72\u20132.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19\u20133.11; 95 CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55\u20135.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public\u2019s risk perception for e\uFB00ective risk communication.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jang, Won Mo; Kim, Un-Na; Jang, Deok Hyun; Jung, Hyemin; Cho, Sanghyun; Eun, Sang Jun; Lee, Jin Yong","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee1da1dd024af358c92cfc92d1c1db60a5697771.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d8a96ab6656a38b3c9380673aefaed8784982a11.json; document_parses/pdf_json/65bfb70c8de73d1e0100a181eb7ae6ee9a06e53a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7059523.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32139484/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["cognitive risk perceptions","Proportions of affective risk perception","government influences affective risk perception","general public\u2019s risk perception","e\uFB00ective risk communication","cognitive dimensions","MERS-CoV epidemic","MERS coronavirus","aOR","Nationwide general population","lower self-reported household economic status respondents","South Korea","influencing factors","low trust","study","general population of Middle East respiratory syndrome","SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES","main outcome measures","consecutive surveys","younger adults","Serial cross-sectional design","age","outbreak","gender","political orientation","area","mechanism","demographic","SETTING","Multivariate logistic regression models","RESULTS","time","efforts","years","need","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","Females","PARTICIPANTS"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to gain insight into the experiences of volunteers from the European Union who worked in deployable laboratories in West Africa during the outbreak. This study is part of the EMERGE project. We assessed the experiences of 251 volunteers with a 19-item online questionnaire. The questions asked about positive aspects of volunteering such as learning new skills, establishing a new path in life, and changing life values. Other questionnaire subjects were the compliance to follow-up measures, the extent to which volunteers felt these measures restricted their daily activities, the fear of stigmatization, and worries about becoming infected or infecting their families. The volunteers reported positive effects that reached far beyond their daily work, such as changes in life priorities and a greater appreciation of the value of their own lives. Although the volunteers did not feel that temperature monitoring restricted their daily activities, full compliance to temperature monitoring and reporting it to the authorities was low. The volunteers did not fear Ebola infection for themselves or their families and were not afraid of stigmatization. With respect to the burden on the families, 50% reported that their family members were worried that the volunteer would be infected with Ebola virus. Altogether, the positive experiences of the volunteers in this study far outweigh the negative implications and constitute an important argument for inspiring people who intend to join such missions and for motivating the hesitant ones.","publish_time":"2018-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belfroid, Evelien; Mollers, Madelief; Smit, Pieter W.; Hulscher, Marlies; Koopmans, Marion; Reusken, Chantal; Timen, Aura","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01cadfe2bb23b6989e57fce2ba744691557faa93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5919609.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa","European Union"],"keyphrases":["experiences of volunteers","positive experiences","families","study","daily activities","compliance","temperature monitoring","West Africa","life priorities","daily work","life values","Ebola infection","fear of stigmatization","positive effects","largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease","positive aspects of volunteering","new path","follow-up measures","new skills","questionnaire subjects","afraid of stigmatization","item online questionnaire","deployable laboratories","important argument","European Union","extent","greater appreciation","negative implications","inspiring people","missions","family members","questions","worries","insight","pressing need","workforce","hesitant ones","authorities","respect","burden","lives","aim","project"],"language":"en"},

It has been reported to have a stronger and broader virucidal activity compared with propanols. The aim of this review was to describe the spectrum of virucidal activity of ethanol in solution or as commercially available products. A systematic search was conducted. Studies were selected when they contained original data on reduction of viral infectivity from suspension tests (49 studies) and contaminated hands (17 studies). Ethanol at 80% was highly effective against all 21 tested, enveloped viruses within 30 s. Murine norovirus and adenovirus type 5 are usually inactivated by ethanol between 70% and 90% in 30 s whereas poliovirus type 1 was often found to be too resistant except for ethanol at 95% (all test viruses of EN 14476). Ethanol at 80% is unlikely to be sufficiently effective against poliovirus, calicivirus (FCV), polyomavirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The spectrum of virucidal activity of ethanol at 95%, however, covers the majority of clinically relevant viruses. Additional acids can substantially improve the virucidal activity of ethanol at lower concentrations against, e.g. poliovirus, FCV, polyomavirus and FMDV although selected viruses such as HAV may still be too resistant. The selection of a suitable virucidal hand rub should be based on the viruses most prevalent in a unit and on the user acceptability of the product under frequent-use conditions.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kampf, G.","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/338cea4fe5bd37df0700f81642681b04fd0a7b25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132458.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670117304693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882643/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2017.08.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670117304693","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["s.

These patients are increasingly susceptible to infection with various pathogens due to the excessive release of anti-inflammatory cytokines from anti-inflammatory effector cells. Recently, CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) found in the sera of mice with pancreatitis was identified as an active molecule for SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation. Also, the inhibitory activity of glycyrrhizin (GL) on CCL2 production was reported. Therefore, the effect of GL on SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation was investigated in a murine SIRS model. Without any stimulation, splenic T cells from mice 5 days after SIRS induction produced cytokines associated with anti-inflammatory response manifestation. However, these cytokines were not produced by splenic T cells from SIRS mice previously treated with GL. In dual-chamber transwells, IL-4-producing cells were generated from normal T cells cultured with peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) from SIRS mice. However, IL-4-producing cells were not generated from normal T cells in transwell cultures performed with PMN from GL-treated SIRS mice. CCL2 was produced by PMN from SIRS mice, while this chemokine was not demonstrated in cultures of PMN from SIRS mice treated with GL. These results indicate that GL has the capacity to suppress SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation through the inhibition of CCL2 production by PMN.","publish_time":"2006-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takei, Miwa; Kobayashi, Makiko; Herndon, David N.; Pollard, Richard B.; Suzuki, Fujio","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ef466cd0925e7fcbb1be2629a52fb02f4ee91f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129928.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466606002766; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466606002766","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GL","SIRS","PMN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GL-treated SIRS mice","SIRS induction","anti-inflammatory response manifestation","anti-inflammatory response syndrome","anti-inflammatory effector cells","normal T cells","splenic T cells","murine SIRS model","sera of mice","cultures of PMN","excessive release of anti-inflammatory cytokines","systemic inflammatory response syndrome","effect of GL","inhibition of CCL2 production","patients","transwell cultures","CC-chemokine ligand","peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils","days","various pathogens","association","active molecule","injury","infection","pancreatitis","results","capacity","stimulation","inhibitory activity of glycyrrhizin","dual-chamber transwells","Abstract","trauma","major surgery"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to study the epidemiology, clinical features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital, including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe patients, from January 2, 2020 to February 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 221 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU (intensive care unit) care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Guqin; Hu, Chang; Luo, Linjie; Fang, Fang; Chen, Yongfeng; Li, Jianguo; Peng, Zhiyong; Pan, Huaqin","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77becc0c569bd4f29bc5d27a20fa62cd106373c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194884.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301062; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311650/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301062","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Huanan Seafood Market","ICU"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["non-severe patients","non-severe pneumonia patients","mortality rate of severe patients","short-term outcomes of patients","severe complications","severe cases","COVID","median age","elder age","ICU","chronic comorbidities","Wuhan","China","higher rate of co-infections","relieved symptoms","common symptoms","clinical features","risk of poor clinical outcomes","intensive care unit","retrospective case series study","lymphocyte count","blood leukocyte","procalcitonin level","high fever","single center","coronavirus disease","outbreak of acute respiratory illness","bacteria","laboratory","anorexia","history of exposure","SARS-CoV","university hospital","fungus","epidemiology","Huanan Seafood Market","dyspnea","general wards","years","leukopenia","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","admission","addition","BACKGROUND","lymphopenia","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The first schools of public health soon followed, but growth was slow, with only 12 schools by 1960. With organization and growing numbers, accreditation became an expectation. As the mission of public health has grown and achieved new urgency, schools have grown in number, depth and breadth. By mid-2011, there were 46 accredited schools of public health, with more in the pipeline. While each has a unique character, they also must possess certain core characteristics to be accredited. Over time, as schools developed, and concepts of public health expanded, so too did curricula and missions as well as types of people who were trained. In this review, we provide a brief summary of US public health education, with primary emphasis on professional public health schools. We also examine public health workforce needs and evaluate how education is evolving in the context of a growing maturity of the public health profession. We have not focused on programs (not schools) that offer public health degrees or on preventive medicine programs in schools of medicine, since schools of public health confer the majority of master\u2019s and doctoral degrees. In the future, there likely will be even more inter-professional education, new disciplinary perspectives and changes in teaching and learning to meet the needs of millennial students.","publish_time":"2011-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosenstock, Linda; Helsing, Karen; Rimer, Barbara K.","journal":"Public Health Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d328c35c680758f035c9ad158dee1ea57b06f4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226193/; https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03391620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["professional public health schools","accredited schools of public health","public health degrees","public health officers","public health profession","public health workforce","concepts of public health","mission of public health","system of public health education","schools of medicine","brief summary of US public health education","inter-professional education","preventive medicine programs","new urgency","growing maturity","growing numbers","doctoral degrees","new disciplinary perspectives","needs of millennial students","primary emphasis","formal career path","majority of master\u2019s","teaching","changes","accreditation","United States","seminal Welch-Rose Report","missions","background","organization","expectation","depth","curricula","context","growth","types of people","certain core characteristics","breadth","review","unique character","time","pipeline","future"],"language":"en"},

As a first step towards understanding the biological role of E protein during PRRSV replication, E gene expression was blocked in a full-length infectious clone by mutating the ATG translational initiation to GTG, such that the full-length mutant genomic clone was unable to synthesize the E protein. DNA transfection of PRRSV-susceptible cells with the E gene knocked-out genomic clone showed the absence of virus infectivity. P129-\u0394E-transfected cells however produced virion particles in the culture supernatant, and these particles contained viral genomic RNA, demonstrating that the E protein is essential for PRRSV infection but dispensable for virion assembly. Electron microscopy suggests that the P129-\u0394E virions assembled in the absence of E had a similar appearance to the wild-type particles. Strand-specific RT-PCR demonstrated that the E protein-negative, non-infectious P129-\u0394E virus particles were able to enter cells but further steps of replication were interrupted. The entry of PRRSV has been suggested to be via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and lysomotropic basic compounds and known ion-channel blocking agents both inhibited PRRSV replication effectively during the uncoating process. The expression of E protein in Escherichia coli-mediated cell growth arrests and increased the membrane permeability. Cross-linking experiments in cells infected with PRRSV or transfected with E gene showed that the E protein was able to form homo-oligomers. Taken together, our data suggest that the PRRSV E protein is likely an ion-channel protein embedded in the viral envelope and facilitates uncoating of virus and release of the genome in the cytoplasm.","publish_time":"2006-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Changhee; Yoo, Dongwan","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a51ddb8a816799d5f38c008a0c869bf83c9e50b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111972.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206004521; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206004521","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV E protein","expression of E protein","E protein-negative","absence of E","biological role of E protein","E gene expression","ion-channel protein","PRRSV infection","entry of PRRSV","protein of porcine reproductive","inhibited PRRSV replication","amino acid protein","DNA transfection of PRRSV","non-infectious P129-\u0394E virus particles","uncoating of virus","virion particles","transfected cells","susceptible cells","absence of virus infectivity","P129-\u0394E virions","full-length mutant genomic clone","respiratory syndrome virus","full-length infectious clone","steps of replication","wild-type particles","viral envelope","viral genomic RNA","virion assembly","small envelope","uncoating process","known ion-channel blocking agents","receptor-mediated endocytosis","Escherichia coli-mediated cell growth arrests","lysomotropic basic compounds","ORF","internal open reading frame","similar appearance","GTG","ATG translational initiation","culture supernatant","release","Strand-specific RT-PCR","membrane permeability","genome","homo-oligomers","Cross-linking experiments","data","bicistronic mRNA2","Electron microscopy","cytoplasm"],"language":"en"},

Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country\u0027s health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. METHODS: We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country\u0027s capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. FINDINGS: Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.

Diagnosis remains challenging and there are no reliable tools to objectively risk stratify patients or predict clinical outcomes. Molecular distance to health (MDTH) is a genomic score that measures the global perturbation of the transcriptional profile and may help classify patients by disease severity. We evaluated the value of MDTH to assess disease severity in children hospitalized with CAP. Methods: Children hospitalized with CAP and matched healthy controls were enrolled in a prospective observational study. Blood samples were obtained for transcriptome analyses within 24 h of hospitalization. MDTH scores were calculated to assess disease severity and correlated with laboratory markers, such as white blood cell count, c-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT), and clinical outcomes, including duration of fever and duration of hospitalization (LOS). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were applied to assess factors associated with LOS and duration of fever after hospitalization. Results: Among children hospitalized with CAP (n = 152), pyogenic bacteria (PB) were detected in 16 (11%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 41 (28%), respiratory viruses (RV) alone were detected in 78 (51%), and no pathogen was detected in 17 (11%) children. Statistical group comparisons identified 6,726 genes differentially expressed in patients with CAP vs. healthy controls (n = 39). Children with confirmed PB had higher MDTH scores than those with RV (p \u003C 0.05) or M. pneumoniae (p \u003C 0.01) detected alone. CRP (r = 0.39, p \u003C 0.0001), PCT (r = 0.39, p \u003C 0.0001), and MDTHs (r = 0.24, p \u003C 0.01) correlated with duration of fever, while only MDTHs correlated with LOS (r = 0.33, p \u003C 0.0001). Unadjusted analyses showed that both higher CRP and MDTHs were associated with longer LOS (OR 1.04 [1\u20131.07] and 1.12 [1.04\u20131.20], respectively), however, only MDTH remained significant when adjusting for other covariates (aOR 1.11 [1.01\u20131.22]). Conclusions: In children hospitalized with CAP MDTH score measured within 24 h of admission was independently associated with longer duration of hospitalization, regardless of the pathogen detected. This suggests that transcriptional biomarkers may represent a promising approach to assess disease severity in children with CAP.","publish_time":"2018-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wallihan, Rebecca G.; Su\u00E1rez, Nicol\u00E1s M.; Cohen, Daniel M.; Marcon, Mario; Moore-Clingenpeel, Melissa; Mejias, Asuncion; Ramilo, Octavio","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6e29e95c1b0aa88f0ebebc39c62fb3bd461be2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6218690.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2018.00382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425971/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["MDTH","CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","CAP MDTH score","disease severity","duration of fever","longer duration of hospitalization","value of MDTH","h of hospitalization","higher MDTH scores","patients","MDTHs","longer LOS","higher CRP","leading cause of hospitalization","clinical outcomes","PCT","pathogen","matched healthy controls","genomic score","Blood samples","transcriptome analyses","confirmed PB","transcriptional profile","Unadjusted analyses","h of admission","transcriptional biomarkers","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","white blood cell count","c-reactive protein","laboratory markers","promising approach","global perturbation","risk","genes","reliable tools","procalcitonin","factors","mortality","multivariable logistic regression","Methods","Statistical group comparisons","prospective observational study","pyogenic bacteria","Community","Molecular distance","covariates","Background","respiratory viruses","Results","Conclusions","aOR","Diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

The influence of treatment and vaccination efforts on the spread of infection in presence of time delays are studied. Sufficient conditions for local stability of the equilibria and change of stability are derived in various cases. The problem of global stability is studied for an important special case of the model. Simulations carried out in this study brought out the importance of treatment rate in controlling the disease spread. It is observed that incubation delays have influence on the system even under enhanced vaccination. The present study has clearly brought out the fact that treatment rate even in presence of time delays would contain the disease as compared to popular belief that eradication can only be done through vaccination.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raja Sekhara Rao, P.; Naresh Kumar, M.","journal":"Chaos, Solitons \u0026 Fractals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b70c1fd82bd1962ab7eec83bdc61fcdb9a2db56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126230.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077915000363; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2015.02.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077915000363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease spread","presence of time delays","presence of incubation delays","influence of treatment","spread of infection","studying dynamics","importance of treatment rate","local stability","vaccination efforts","enhanced vaccination","present study","specific types of infectious diseases","Abstract Understanding dynamics","problem of global stability","new model","system","important special case","equilibria","populations","appropriate strategies","fact","relapse","Recent mathematical models","Sufficient conditions","eradication","popular belief","paper","various cases","Simulations"],"language":"en"},

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II genes are essential for the immune defence against pathogens from intracellular (e.g. viruses) and extracellular (e.g. helminths) origins, respectively. Serosurvey studies in Namibian cheetahs (Acinonyx juabuts) revealed higher exposure to viral pathogens in individuals from north-central than east-central regions. Here we examined whether the observed differences in exposure to viruses influence the patterns of genetic variation and differentiation at MHC loci in 88 free-ranging Namibian cheetahs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genetic variation at MHC I and II loci was assessed through single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing. While the overall allelic diversity did not differ, we observed a high genetic differentiation at MHC class I loci between cheetahs from north-central and east-central Namibia. No such differentiation in MHC class II and neutral markers were found. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that MHC class I variation mirrors the variation in selection pressure imposed by viruses in free-ranging cheetahs across Namibian farmland.

Given the disproportionate burden of severe and mortal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other related coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected. Objectives To describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease. Study design We describe here a multi-institution adjudicated case series from Iran which includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease during their latter 2nd or 3rd trimester. All 9 pregnant women were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR nucleic acid testing (NAT). Outcomes of these women were compared to their familial/household members with exposure to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease. Results Among 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator-dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance the maternal outcomes were more severe when compared to other high and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison). Conclusion We report herein maternal deaths due to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerges, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 disease in their latter trimester(s).","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh; Shamshirsaz, Alireza A.; Aleyasin, Ashraf; Seferovic, Maxim D.; Aski, Soudabeh Kazemi; Arian, Sara E.; Pooransari, Parichehr; Ghotbizadeh, Fahimeh; Aalipour, Soroush; Soleimani, Zahra; Naemi, Mahsa; Molaei, Behnaz; Ahangari, Roghaye; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Oskoei, Atousa Dabiri; Pirozan, Parisa; Darkhaneh, Roya Faraji; Laki, Mahboobeh Gharib; Farani, Ali Karimi; Atrak, Shahla; Miri, Mir Mohammad; Kouchek, Mehran; Shojaei, Seyedpouzhia; Hadavand, Fahimeh; Keikha, Fatemeh; Hosseini, Maryam Sadat; Borna, Sedigheh; Ariana, Shideh; Shariat, Mamak; Fatemi, Alireza; Nouri, Behnaz; Nekooghadam, Seyed Mojtaba; Aagaard, Kjersti","journal":"Am J Obstet Gynecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7a0235faed420dc98c2b7190e9f37a4f88d9f22.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820305160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360108/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.04.030; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820305160?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","case series of pregnant women","maternal outcomes","maternal deaths","maternal morbidity","mortal respiratory disease","household members","severe respiratory morbidity","SARS-CoV","household cohort data","disproportionate burden of severe","MERS-CoV","perinatal outcomes","surveillance data","trimester","low-risk familial","related coronavirus outbreaks","rRT-PCR nucleic acid testing","Iran","potential","multi-institution","affected patient","exposure","mortality","infections","influenza pandemics","century","days","absence","date of admission","minimum","cases","Objectives","instance","Results","symptom onset","Study design","ventilator-dependent","Abstract Background","comparison","time of reporting","Conclusion","prolonged hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD, and some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations leading to hospital admission and readmission. These frequent exacerbations may have considerable impact on quality of life and activities of daily living. Factors that increase the risk for COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway inflammation caused by common pollutants and bacterial and/or viral infections. These inflammatory responses cause mucus hypersecretion and, thereby, airway obstruction and associated exacerbations. While chronic mucus hypersecretion is a significant risk factor for frequent and severe exacerbations, patients with chronic mucus hypersecretion have a lower rate of relapse after initial treatment for acute exacerbation. The benefit of antibiotics for treatment of COPD exacerbations is small but significant. While the mechanisms of actions are not clear, mucolytic agents reduce the number of days of disability in subjects with exacerbations. Reducing mucous cell numbers in small airways could be a useful way to reduce chronic mucus hypersecretion. Our studies suggest that programmed cell death is crucial in the resolution of metaplastic mucous cells, and understanding these mechanisms may provide novel therapies to reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tesfaigzi, Yohannes; Meek, Paula; Lareau, Suzanne","journal":"Clinical and Applied Immunology Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/860ba42a414be56d8892be78865f939fcd3fb2e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110639.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cair.2006.02.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1529104906000201; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1529104906000201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288656/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of COPD exacerbations","frequent exacerbations","treatment of COPD exacerbations","associated exacerbations","severe exacerbations","chronic mucus hypersecretion","increasing severity of COPD","inflammatory responses cause mucus hypersecretion","patients","significant risk factor","mucous cell numbers","Abstract Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","initial treatment","small airways","considerable impact","considerable morbidity","important cause","airway obstruction","mechanisms of actions","increased airway inflammation","programmed cell death","resolution of metaplastic mucous cells","lower rate of relapse","number of days","quality of life","useful way","common pollutants","mucolytic agents","hospital admission","activities of daily living","acute exacerbation","disability","subjects","mortality","novel therapies","benefit of antibiotics","studies","readmission","viral infections","Factors"],"language":"en"},

To address this racial disparity, we must apply a health equity lens and disaggregate data explicitly for African Americans, as well as other populations at risk for biased treatment in the health-care system.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Milam, Adam J.; Furr-Holden, Debra; Edwards-Johnson, Jennifer; Webb, Birgete; Patton, John W.; Ezekwemba, Nnayereugo C.; Porter, Lekiesha; Davis, TomMario; Chukwurah, Marius; Webb, Antonio J.; Simon, Kevin; Franck, Geden; Anthony, Joshua; Onuoha, Gerald; Brown, Italo M.; Carson, James T.; Stephens, Brent C.","journal":"Health Equity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3fe3743ea6e7851f109651013afdcee161bec4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194321.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368712/; https://doi.org/10.1089/heq.2020.0015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcomes","disparate COVID","African Americans","racial disparity","African American disparity","structural factors","multitude of factors","individual-level factors","reported coronavirus disease","health-care system","health equity lens","biased treatment","data","risk","populations","higher rates of comorbidities","implicit biases","cases","deaths"],"language":"en"},

As a result, there is an interest by child maltreatment researchers to develop methodologies that allow for the triangulation of data sources. To better understand how social media and internet-based technologies could contribute to these approaches, we conducted a scoping review to provide an overview of social media and internet-based methodologies for health research, to report results of evaluation and validation research on these methods, and to highlight studies with potential relevance to child maltreatment research and surveillance. Many approaches were identified in the broad health literature; however, there has been limited application of these approaches to child maltreatment. The most common use was recruiting participants or engaging existing participants using online methods. From the broad health literature, social media and internet-based approaches to surveillance and epidemiologic research appear promising. Many of the approaches are relatively low cost and easy to implement without extensive infrastructure, but there are also a range of limitations for each method. Several methods have a mixed record of validation and sources of error in estimation are not yet understood or predictable. In addition to the problems relevant to other health outcomes, child maltreatment researchers face additional challenges, including the complex ethical issues associated with both internet-based and child maltreatment research. If these issues are adequately addressed, social media and internet-based technologies may be a promising approach to reducing some of the limitations in existing child maltreatment data.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwab-Reese, Laura M.; Hovdestad, Wendy; Tonmyr, Lil; Fluke, John","journal":"Child Abuse \u0026 Neglect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0238a1b19642b5488f67b429cb8368f332efc1e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112406.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.01.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213418300267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29366596/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145213418300267","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["child maltreatment researchers","internet-based approaches","existing child maltreatment data","health research","internet-based technologies","internet-based methodologies","Abstract Collecting child maltreatment data","validation research","overview of social media","epidemiologic research","broad health literature","health outcomes","surveillance","existing participants","triangulation of data sources","online methods","sources of error","promising approach","range of limitations","mixed record of validation","complex ethical issues","additional challenges","complicated undertaking","potential relevance","studies","results of evaluation","problems relevant","estimation","low cost","scoping review","limited application","extensive infrastructure","common use","reasons"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of outbreak reports from India during 2008\u201316, that reported the steps in outbreak investigation. The secondary objectives were to (1) describe the outbreak reports by selected characteristics (source, investigating agency, disease, time, place and person) (2) estimate the proportion of outbreaks that conducted analytical and additional studies. METHODS: We searched eight electronic databases and grey literature for outbreak investigation reports among humans at community settings from India during 2008\u20132016. We developed a check-list based on the 10-steps approach used by Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) of ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR-NIE), Chennai, India. This checklist was used to independently screen and extract data on general characteristics of the outbreak investigation reports and the steps completed. We adopted The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) check list for prevalence studies to examine the credibility and consistency. The protocol was registered at Prospero (CRD42017065038). We calculated proportion of reports that followed the steps in their investigation and descriptive statistics on selected characteristics. RESULTS: Of 10,657 articles screened, 136 articles were included for the review. Completion of the ten steps in the outbreak investigations was seen in 16% of reports. The highest level of completion was for drawing conclusion in outbreak investigation (98%) and the lowest completion (29%) was for developing a case definition by time, place and person followed by conducting an analytic study (24%). CONCLUSIONS: Outbreak reports from India either lacked application of systematic steps for investigation or failed to report the actual procedures followed.

Abstract Lung disease is very common in patients with hematologic neoplasms and varies in function of the underlying disease and its treatment. Lung involvement is associated with high morbidity and mortality, so it requires early appropriate treatment. Chest computed tomography (CT) and the analysis of biologic specimens are the first line diagnostic tools in these patients, and sometimes invasive methods are necessary. Interpreting the images requires an analysis of the clinical context, which is often complex. Starting from the knowledge about the differential diagnosis of lung findings that radiologists acquire during training, this article aims to explain the key clinical and radiological aspects that make it possible to orient the diagnosis correctly and to understand the current role of CT in the treatment strategy for this group of patients.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calvillo Batll\u00E9s, P.; Carreres Polo, J.; Sanz Caballer, J.; Salavert Llet\u00ED, M.; Compte Torrero, L.","journal":"Radiolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d69b412e9a8a71e4911a6327345cbd3fdfffe0c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127573.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033833815001241; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033833815001241","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Interpreting the","of the clinical context","in function of the underlying","orient the diagnosis correctly and","understand the current","of CT in the treatment strategy for","and its treatment","group of patients","the first line diagnostic tools in these patients","Starting from the knowledge about the differential diagnosis of lung findings that radiologists acquire during training","explain the key clinical and radiological aspects that make it possible","of biologic specimens","very common in patients with hematologic neoplasms and","associated with high morbidity and mortality","Lung involvement","Abstract Lung","herramientas de diagn\u00F3stico","diagn\u00F3stico diferencial","TC","early appropriate treatment","an\u00E1lisis de muestras biol\u00F3gicas","article aims","which","invasive methods","historia","pacientes","neoplasia hematol\u00F3gica","primera l\u00EDnea empleadas","enfermedad de base","contexto cl\u00EDnico","estrategia terap\u00E9utica","hallazgos pulmonares","Chest computed tomography","often complex","determinados casos","aspectos cl\u00EDnicos","trabajo","funci\u00F3n","radiol\u00F3gicos claves","papel actual","m\u00E9todos invasivos","terapia recibida","ocasiones complejo","grupo de enfermos","objetivo","im\u00E1genes","tomograf\u00EDa computarizada","radi\u00F3logo","formaci\u00F3n","necessary","patolog\u00EDa pulmonar","morbimortalidad asociada","tratamiento correcto","interpretaci\u00F3n","conocimiento"],"language":"es"},

The core of the nidovirus superfamily 1 helicase (HEL1) is associated with a unique N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD) that was previously implicated in helicase regulation, genome replication and subgenomic mRNA synthesis. The high-resolution structure of the arterivirus helicase (nsp10), alone and in complex with a polynucleotide substrate, now provides first insights into the structural basis for nidovirus helicase function. A previously uncharacterized domain 1B connects HEL1 domains 1A and 2A to a long linker of ZBD, which further consists of a novel RING-like module and treble-clef zinc finger, together coordinating three Zn atoms. On substrate binding, major conformational changes were evident outside the HEL1 domains, notably in domain 1B. Structural characterization, mutagenesis and biochemistry revealed that helicase activity depends on the extensive relay of interactions between the ZBD and HEL1 domains. The arterivirus helicase structurally resembles the cellular Upf1 helicase, suggesting that nidoviruses may also use their helicases for post-transcriptional quality control of their large RNA genomes.","publish_time":"2013-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Zengqin; Lehmann, Kathleen C.; Li, Xiaorong; Feng, Chong; Wang, Guoqiang; Zhang, Qi; Qi, Xiaoxuan; Yu, Lin; Zhang, Xingliang; Feng, Wenhai; Wu, Wei; Gong, Peng; Tao, Ye; Posthuma, Clara C.; Snijder, Eric J.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Chen, Zhongzhou","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2559cb0b4a2175212495ab7d44d9305db4a06c05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3950703.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24369429/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["arterivirus helicase","helicase activity","helicase regulation","HEL1 domains","nidovirus helicase function","cellular Upf1 helicase","substrate binding","uncharacterized domain","helicases","unique N-terminal zinc-binding domain","large RNA genomes","long linker of ZBD","structural basis","nidovirus superfamily","Structural characterization","polynucleotide substrate","treble-clef zinc finger","positive-stranded RNA viruses","post-transcriptional quality control","module","genome replication","major conformational changes","subgenomic mRNA synthesis","insights","mutagenesis","biochemistry","extensive relay of interactions","nsp10","nidoviruses","high-resolution structure","novel RING","complex","core","Zn atoms"],"language":"en"},

However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) remain unclear. In this study, we found that MHV N protein inhibited Sendai virus and poly(I:C)-induced IFN-\u03B2 production by targeting a molecule upstream of retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation gene 5 (MDA5). Further studies showed that both MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins directly interacted with protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT), a cellular dsRNA-binding protein that can bind to RIG-I and MDA5 to activate IFN production. The N\u2013PACT interaction sequestered the association of PACT and RIG-I/MDA5, which in turn inhibited IFN-\u03B2 production. However, the N proteins from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), which are also classified in the order Nidovirales, did not interact and counteract with PACT. Taken together, our present study confirms that both MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins can perturb the function of cellular PACT to circumvent the innate antiviral response.

The role of social media amid the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue. Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations. OBJECTIVE: Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis. This study investigates information transmission networks and news-sharing behaviors regarding COVID-19 on Twitter in Korea. The real time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this outbreak. METHODS: Korean COVID-19-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. Our final sample comprised of 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter. We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding COVID-19 in Korea. This study comparatively investigates how COVID-19-related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis. Next, we classified top news channels shared via tweets. Lastly, we conducted a content analysis of news frames used in the top-shared sources. RESULTS: The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu). People who used the word \u201CCoronavirus\u201D communicated more frequently with each other. The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms. Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers\u2019 attention to the crisis. Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also emerged often. There was a significant difference in the use of nonportal (n=14) and portal news (n=26) sites between the four network types. The news frames used in the top sources were similar across the networks (P=.89, 95% CI 0.004-0.006). Tweets containing medically framed news articles (mean 7.571, SD 1.988) were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting nonmedical frames (mean 5.060, SD 2.904; N=40, P=.03, 95% CI 0.169-4.852). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the popular news on Twitter had nonmedical frames. Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about COVID-19 was greater than that of news with nonmedical frames. Social media network analytics cannot replace the work of public health officials; however, monitoring public conversations and media news that propagates rapidly can assist public health professionals in their complex and fast-paced decision-making processes.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Han Woo; Park, Sejung; Chong, Miyoung","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202309.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325426/; https://doi.org/10.2196/18897","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Korea"],"keyphrases":["media news","popular news","news items","portal news","news channels","content analysis of news frames","network analysis","framed news articles","Coronavirus network","Social media network analytics","nonmedical frames","Korean COVID","spread of information","network types","Social media functions","role of social media","information transmission networks","medical information","related Twitter data","tweets","related issues","South Korea","convenient source of information","real time aggregation of social media data","public health professionals","health campaigns","work of public health officials","public conversations","current coronavirus disease","Ethical issues","terms of key issues","study","SD","shared sources","severe acute respiratory coronavirus","readers\u2019 attention","initial outbreak","pandemic situations","new center of global attention","population","individuals","strategic messages","starting point","China","conjunction","effective communication system","behaviors","entertainment frame","deviant behavior","positive roles","infodemiology studies","SARS-CoV","groups","use of nonportal","users","sites","celebrity donations","significant difference","decision-making processes","Corona19","Shincheon","end","spillover effect","diameter value","little systematic research","final sample","Daegu","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVE","crisis","People","word","relationships","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections. Most of the published studies that suggested not protective effects of NSAIDs were mainly performed in vitro or on animals. Therefore, their meaning in humans is to be considered with great caution. Based also on data suggesting protective effects of NSAIDs, we concluded that currently there is no evidence suggesting a correlation between NSAIDs and a worsening of infections. Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly COX2 inhibitors in patients with infections.

There are no randomized controlled trials on the effect of systemic corticosteroids in patients with this disease. Objective We sought to study the short- and long-term effects of prednisolone treatment of the first acute, moderate-to-severe, rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode in young children. Methods After confirming rhinovirus from nasopharyngeal aspirate by using PCR, 79 children with a first wheezing episode at age 3 to 23 months were randomized to receive oral prednisolone (first dose of 2 mg/kg, followed by 2 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses for 3 days) or placebo. The trial was double blind throughout the 12-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were long term: new physician-confirmed wheezing episode within 2 months, number of physician-confirmed wheezing episodes within 12 months, and initiation of regular controller medication for asthma symptoms within 12 months. The primary interaction analysis examined rhinovirus load. Results Seventy-four patients completed the study (mean age, 13 months; 28% atopic). Long-term outcomes did not differ between groups (all P \u2265 .30). For short-term outcomes, the prednisolone group had less cough, rhinitis, noisy breathing, severe breathing difficulties, and nocturnal respiratory symptoms at home within 2 weeks (all P \u003C .05). The 25 children with greater than 7000 rhinovirus copies/mL (most sensitive cutoff) benefitted from prednisolone in terms of less risk of physician-confirmed recurrence within 2 and 12 months compared with placebo (both P \u003C .05). Conclusions Prednisolone cannot be routinely recommended for all young children experiencing their first acute, moderate-to-severe, rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode. Prednisolone might be beneficial in a subgroup of children with high viral loads.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jartti, Tuomas; Nieminen, Riitta; Vuorinen, Tytti; Lehtinen, Pasi; Vahlberg, Tero; Gern, James; Camargo, Carlos A.; Ruuskanen, Olli","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28bfd55cd477029dab0e713bba17caa5da31ca55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112325.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674914009002; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2014.07.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674914009002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25129681/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["months","Background Rhinovirus-induced wheezing","wheezing episodes","recurrent wheezing","rhinovirus copies","rhinovirus load","prednisolone group","young children","oral prednisolone","Conclusions Prednisolone","subgroup of children","risk of physician","primary outcomes","long-term effects of prednisolone treatment","Long-term outcomes","severe breathing difficulties","new physician","number of physician","patients","short-term outcomes","study","placebo","noisy breathing","asthma symptoms","mean age","nocturnal respiratory symptoms","important risk factor","primary interaction analysis","randomized controlled trials","rhinitis","initiation of regular controller medication","effect of systemic corticosteroids","long term","home","cough","nasopharyngeal aspirate","high viral loads","weeks","sensitive cutoff","PCR","terms","double blind","divided doses","days","disease","Methods","groups","recurrence","month follow-up","Results","Objective"],"language":"en"},

In addition to the RV glycoprotein (G) transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, a portion of the RV G ectodomain was required to express the chimeric RV G anthrax PA on the cell surface. The novel antigen was also efficiently incorporated into RV virions. Mice immunized with the inactivated recombinant RV virions exhibited seroconversion against both RV G and anthrax PA, and a second inoculation greatly increased these responses.

Abstract There is debate as to whether olfactory dysfunction should be considered a symptom of COVID-19 infection, given the implications for managing the symptom itself, for diagnostic testing, and for implementing isolation measures. We undertook a systematic literature review of the articles indexed in PubMed on olfactory disorders in viral respiratory tract conditions, with special emphasis on COVID-19. The main objective was to find evidence of clinical interest to support the relationship between anosmia and COVID-19. Olfactory disorders in upper respiratory tract infections are frequent, most caused by obstruction due to oedema of the nasal mucosa. Occasionally, post-viral sensorineural olfactory dysfunction occurs, with a variable prognosis. The evidence on anosmia in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited, corresponding to a level 5 or D of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. According to the various medical societies that have issued reports on the subject, it seems reasonable to apply isolation, hygiene and social distancing measures in patients with recent olfactory disorders as the only symptom, although the usefulness of diagnostic tests for this type of patient should be studied.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lop Gros, J; Iglesias Coma, M; Gonz\u00E1lez Farr\u00E9, M; Serra Pujadas, C","journal":"Acta Otorrinolaringol Esp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76120b279209ccd5547120aff085f2fa19c97e51.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001651920300790?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001651920300790","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Centre"],"keyphrases":["The evidence on anosmia in COVID","on COVID","or D of the","for Evidence","oedema of the nasal mucosa","the various medical","given the implications for managing the symptom itself","although the usefulness of diagnostic tests for","support the relationship between anosmia and COVID","alteraciones","The main objective was","in patients with recent olfactory disorders as the only symptom","whether olfactory dysfunction should be considered a symptom of COVID","We undertook a systematic literature review of the","indexed in PubMed on olfactory disorders in viral respiratory tract conditions","that have issued reports on the subject","for diagnostic testing","and for implementing isolation","find evidence of clinical interest","Olfactory disorders in upper respiratory tract infections","tipo de pacientes","viral sensorineural olfactory dysfunction occurs","type of patient should be studied","with special","debate as","mucosa nasal","realizaci\u00F3n de pruebas diagn\u00F3sticas","medidas de aislamiento","\u00FAnico s\u00EDntoma","s\u00EDntoma de infecci\u00F3n","Based","hygiene and social distancing","apply isolation","distanciamiento social","v\u00EDas altas","v\u00EDas respiratorias","tipo neurosensorial","aplicaci\u00F3n de medidas","pron\u00F3stico variable","variable prognosis","disfunci\u00F3n olfatoria post","evidencia de inter\u00E9s cl\u00EDnico","frequent","most caused by obstruction due","it seems reasonable","level","art\u00EDculos indexados","corresponding","higiene","procesos infecciosos","cuadros virales","extremely limited","reciente aparici\u00F3n","causa obstructiva","Abstract There","especial \u00E9nfasis","revisi\u00F3n sistem\u00E1tica bibliogr\u00E1fica","mayor\u00EDa","respecto","relaci\u00F3n","According","Occasionally","sociedades m\u00E9dicas","objetivo principal","ansomia","utilidad","implicaciones","acuerdo","manejo","Resumen"],"language":"es"},

Immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin confirmed that 60\u201375% of cultured cells were epithelial cells. Furthermore, following infection with bovine rotavirus (BRV) over 80% of cells in the ileal and jejunal cultures contained viral protein at 16h post-infection. The intestinal epithelial cell cultures also contained fibroblasts so a jejunal fibroblast culture was established and infected with BRV. Viral protein was detected in jejunal fibroblasts but viral-induced cytopathology was delayed in fibroblast cultures when compared to epithelial cell cultures. This study describes an effective protocol for culturing bovine epithelial cells from fetal intestine and confirmed that the epithelial cells were susceptible to BRV infection.

The potential application of landscape genetics to infectious agents has garnered attention at formative stages in the development of landscape genetics, but systematic examination is lacking. We comprehensively review how landscape genetics is being used to better understand pathogen dynamics. We characterize the field and evaluate the types of questions addressed, approaches used and systems studied. We also review the now established landscape genetic methods and their realized and potential applications to disease ecology. Lastly, we identify emerging frontiers in the landscape genetic study of infectious agents, including recent phylogeographic approaches and frameworks for studying complex multihost and host\u2010vector systems. Our review emphasizes the expanding utility of landscape genetic methods available for elucidating key pathogen dynamics (particularly transmission and spread) and also how landscape genetic studies of pathogens can provide insight into host population dynamics.

Rotaviruses have a wide host range infecting a broad range of animal species, however little is known about rotavirus infection in exotic animals. In this paper we report the first characterisation of a RV strain from a giraffe calf. RESULTS: This report describes the identification and detailed molecular characterisation of a rotavirus strain detected from a 14-day-old Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), presenting with acute diarrhea. The RV strain detected from the giraffe was characterized molecularly as G10P[11]. Detailed sequence analysis of VP4 and VP7 revealed significant identity at the amino acid sequence level to Bovine RV (BoRV). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the need for continuous surveillance of RV strains in various animal populations, which will facilitate the identification of rotavirus hosts not previously reported. Furthermore, extending typical epidemiology studies to a broader host range will contribute to the timely identification of new emerging strain types.","publish_time":"2008-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mulherin, Emily; Bryan, Jill; Beltman, Marijke; O\u0027Grady, Luke; Pidgeon, Eugene; Garon, Lucie; Lloyd, Andrew; Bainbridge, John; O\u0027Shea, Helen; Whyte, Paul; Fanning, S\u00E9amus","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad7c54f9cbd1779ce878360e15699bebcbd80cd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2632637.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19014526/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-4-46","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rotavirus strain","identification of rotavirus","Bovine RV","rotavirus infection","broader host range","wide host range","continuous surveillance of RV strains","day-old Giraffe","giraffe calf","report","timely identification of new emerging strain types","broad range of animal species","detailed molecular characterisation","Detailed sequence analysis of VP4","acute diarrhea","various animal populations","amino acid sequence level","important etiological agent of acute viral gastroenteritis","significant identity","VP7","need","Reoviridae family","typical epidemiology studies","Giraffa camelopardalis","study","BoRV","exotic animals","member","Rotaviruses","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","paper","G10P"],"language":"en"},

Objective: We tested the hypothesis that medical students receive insufficient training on correct methods for donning and doffing PPE. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of medical students on clinical rotations at two teaching hospitals to determine the type of training they received in PPE technique. The students performed simulations of contaminated PPE removal with fluorescent lotion on gloves and were assessed for correct PPE technique and skin and/or clothing contamination. To obtain additional information on PPE training during medical education, residents, fellows, and attending physicians completed written questionnaires on PPE training received during medical school and on knowledge of PPE protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: Of 27 medical students surveyed, only 11 (41%) reported receiving PPE training, and none had received training requiring demonstration of proficiency. During simulations, 25 of 27 (92.5%) students had one or more lapses in technique and 12 (44%) contaminated their skin with fluorescent lotion. For 100 residents, fellows and attending physicians representing 67 different medical schools, only 53% reported receiving training in use of PPE and only 39% selected correct donning and doffing sequence. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a need for development of effective strategies to train medical students in correct use of PPE.

AIM: This systematic review summarizes the current scientific evidence regarding the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalized children based on available case series from China. In addition, first data from a nationwide pediatric hospital survey conducted by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (DGPI) are presented. METHODS: This study evaluated 12 case series from China with 6\u20132143 children infected with SARS-CoV\u20112, which were identified by a literature search in PubMed up to 31 March 2020. The database of the German nationwide DGPI COVID-19 survey was accessed on 6 April 2020. RESULTS: The median patient age in the case series was between 2 and 7 years and 18\u201345% were infants \u003C1 year of age. The duration of hospital stay was 5\u201320 days. Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40\u2013100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Severe and critical courses of disease were reported in up to 8% of the children including 2 fatalities. So far the German DGPI COVID-19 survey reported 33 hospitalized children up to 6 April 2020, mostly with upper airway infections. Of these children, 45% were infants and 32% had an underlying medical condition. So far 3 children (9%) needed admission to an intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in hospitalized children usually presented as an uncomplicated febrile upper airway infection or mild pneumonia. Severe cases or fatalities rarely occurred in children. Information on neonates and children with underlying chronic conditions as well as on therapeutic and preventive measures are urgently needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Streng, A.; Hartmann, K.; Armann, J.; Berner, R.; Liese, J.

One hundred and sixty\u2013seven animals were treated once orally with 15 mg/kg toltrazuril, and 164 animals served as placebo\u2013treated controls. Two treatment regimes were compared, a metaphylactic (treatment on the day, or 1 day after, turn out) and a therapeutic treatment (4 or 7 days after turn out). During an observation period of 14 days after treatment the animals were clinically examined for diarrhoea and faecal samples were regularly assessed for Eimeria oocysts. Other possible causes of diarrhoea were excluded on the basis of microbiological and virological examination. Animals were predominantly infected with Eimeria alabamensis. Number of days with diarrhoea in animals treated with toltrazuril was significantly lower compared to the placebo\u2013treated group (therapeutic treatment: P=0.0024; metaphylactic treatment: P\u003C0.0001). Furthermore, the number of animals with diarrhoea during the observation period for a minimum of at least 3 days, the number of animals positive for Eimeria oocysts, and the number of animals with both diarrhoea for a period of at least 3 days and positive for Eimeria oocysts, were signiflicantly lower (P\u003C0.01), in the toltrazuril\u2013 compared to the placebo\u2013treated animals. Body weight in the toltrazuril\u2013treated animals significantly exceeded that of the placebo\u2013treated animals at the end of the observation period.

To learn from our experience, we described the critical care response to the outbreak. METHODS: This observational study was conducted at the Intensive Care Department which covered 5 ICUs with 60 single-bedded rooms. We described qualitatively and, as applicable, quantitatively the response of intensive care services to the outbreak. The clinical course and outcomes of healthcare workers (HCWs) who had MERS were noted. RESULTS: Sixty-three MERS patients were admitted to 3 MERS-designated ICUs during the outbreak (peak census = 27 patients on August 25, 2015, and the last new case on September 13, 2015). Most patients had multiorgan failure. Eight HCWs had MERS requiring ICU admission (median stay = 28 days): Seven developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, four were treated with prone positioning, four needed continuous renal replacement therapy and one had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The hospital mortality of ICU MERS patients was 63.4 % (0 % for the HCWs). In response to the outbreak, the number of negative-pressure rooms was increased from 14 to 38 rooms in 3 MERS-designated ICUs. Patients were managed with a nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:0.8. Infection prevention practices were intensified. As a surrogate, surface disinfectant and hand hygiene gel consumption increased by ~30 % and 17 N95 masks were used per patient/day on average. Family visits were restricted to 2 h/day. Although most ICU staff expressed concerns about acquiring MERS, all reported to work normally. During the outbreak, 27.0 % of nurses and 18.4 % of physicians working in the MERS-designated ICUs reported upper respiratory symptoms, and were tested for MERS-CoV. Only 2/196 (1.0 %) ICU nurses and 1/80 (1.3 %) physician tested positive, had mild disease and recovered fully. The total sick leave duration was 138 days for nurses and 30 days for physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Our hospital outbreak of MERS resulted in 63 patients requiring organ support and prolonged ICU stay with a high mortality rate. The ICU response required careful facility and staff management and proper infection control and prevention practices.","publish_time":"2016-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Dorzi, Hasan M.; Aldawood, Abdulaziz S.; Khan, Raymond; Baharoon, Salim; Alchin, John D.; Matroud, Amal A.; Al Johany, Sameera M.; Balkhy, Hanan H.; Arabi, Yaseen M.","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7d87ef17e8863714b7ccd091373777918e9131d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5078123.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27778310/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-016-0203-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["King Abdulaziz Medical City","Intensive Care Department","MERS","ICU","ICU MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["hospital outbreak of MERS","MERS-CoV","MERS-designated ICUs","hospital mortality of ICU MERS patients","ICU response","ICU nurses","ICU staff","major outbreak","prolonged ICU","ICU admission","days","critical care response","HCWs","response of intensive care services","bed tertiary-care hospital","hospital outbreaks","Intensive Care Department","Infection prevention practices","pressure rooms","physicians","upper respiratory symptoms","single-bedded rooms","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","developed acute respiratory distress syndrome","staff management","median stay","patient ratio","proper infection control","high mortality rate","needed continuous renal replacement therapy","careful facility","surface disinfectant","Riyadh","King Abdulaziz Medical City","hand hygiene gel consumption","outcomes of healthcare workers","prone positioning","BACKGROUND","total sick leave duration","number of negative","organ support","peak census","clinical course","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","surrogate","Saudi Arabia","observational study","mild disease","concerns","CONCLUSIONS","N95 masks","Family visits","METHODS","experience","average","multiorgan failure","RESULTS","new case"],"language":"en"},

Despite strain and cell specific differences in released IL-6, equivalent levels of IL-6 mRNA were induced in all cell types following exposure to MHV-4 or UV-MHV-4.","publish_time":"1993-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joseph, Jeymohan; Grun, James L.; Lublin, Fred D.; Knobler, Robert L.","journal":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff99cb8f85c4cace8e4c60489c8221ba0303728c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016557289390211G; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016557289390211G","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SJL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UV-MHV","UV inactivated MHV","exposure","released IL","substantial IL","BALB","SJL cells","equivalent levels of IL","c endothelial cells","SJL astrocytes","cell types","minimal response","basal levels","strain difference","cell specific differences","mice","mouse hepatitis virus","mRNA","bioassay","Northern analysis","Abstract Interleukin","induction","contrast"],"language":"en"},

More than two-thirds of human viruses can also infect non-human hosts, mainly mammals, and sometimes birds. Many specialist human viruses also have mammalian or avian origins. Indeed, a substantial proportion of mammalian viruses may be capable of crossing the species barrier into humans, although only around half of these are capable of being transmitted by humans and around half again of transmitting well enough to cause major outbreaks. A few possible predictors of species jumps can be identified, including the use of phylogenetically conserved cell receptors.

Herein, 40 novel unsymmetrical aromatic disulfides were synthesized chemically and their biological activities were evaluated in vitro against SARS-CoV Mpro. These novel compounds displayed excellent IC 50 data in the range of 0.516\u20135.954 \u03BCM. Preliminary studies indicated that these disulfides are reversible and mpetitive inhibitors.

This knowledge was neglected in European veterinary medicine for decades but kept alive by farmers. Emergence of multidrug resistant bacterial strains requires a severely restricted use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine. We conducted a survey on the ethnoveterinary knowledge of farmers in the bilingual (French and German speaking) Western region of Switzerland, namely the cantons of Fribourg, Neuch\u00E2tel and Jura, and in the French speaking part of the canton of Bern. AIM OF THE STUDY: To find out whether differences exist in plants used by farmers in French speaking and bilingual regions of Switzerland as compared to our earlier studies conducted in Switzerland. Additional focus was on plants that are used in diseases which commonly are treated with antimicrobials, on plants used in skin afflictions, and on plants used in animal species such as horses, for which the range of veterinary medicinal products is limited. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted in 2015 semistructured interviews with 62 dialog partners, mainly cattle keeping farmers but also 18 horse keeping farmers. Of these, 41 were native French (FNS) and 21 native German speakers (GNS). Detailed information about homemade herbal remedies (plant species, plant part, manufacturing process) and the corresponding use reports (target animal species, category of use, route of administration, dosage, source of knowledge, frequency of use, last time of use and farmers satisfaction) were collected. RESULTS: A total of 345 homemade remedies were reported, of which 240 contained only one plant species (Homemade Single Species Herbal Remedy Reports; HSHR). A total of 289 use reports (UR) were mentioned for the 240 HSHR, and they comprised 77 plant species belonging to 41 botanical families. Of these, 35 plant species were solely reported from FNS, 20 from GNS, and 22 from both. Taking into account earlier ethnoveterinary studies conducted in Switzerland only 10 (FNS) and 6 (GNS) plant species connected with 7% of FNS and GNS UR respectively were \u201Cunique\u201D to the respective language group. The majority of the UR (219) was for treatment of cattle, while 38 UR were intended to treat horses. The most UR were for treatment of gastrointestinal and skin diseases. The most frequently mentioned plants were Linum usitatissimum L., Coffea L., Matricaria chamomilla L., Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, and Quercus robur L. for gastrointestinal diseases, and Calendula officinalis L., Hypericum perforatum L. and Sanicula europaea L. for skin afflictions. CONCLUSION: No clear differences were found between the medicinal plants used by French native speakers and German native speakers. Several of the reported plants seem to be justified to widen the spectrum of veterinary therapeutic options in gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders in cattle and horses, and to reduce, at least to a certain degree, the need for antibiotic treatments. Our findings may help to strengthen the role of medicinal plants in veterinary research and practice, and to consider them as a further measure in official strategies for lowering the use of antibiotics.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mertenat, Dor\u00E9ane; Cero, Maja Dal; Vogl, Christan R.; Ivemeyer, Silvia; Meier, Beat; Maeschli, Ariane; Hamburger, Matthias; Walkenhorst, Michael","journal":"J Ethnopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88c6892230189edaea262895b14a15b1c6032041.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0fa74d92a26432cab5d2f1f445d8c593cc5b3c41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185669.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465817/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.112184; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874119322767; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874119322767","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Homemade Single Species Herbal Remedy Reports","FNS"],"locations":["Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["plant species","reported plants","mentioned plants","role of medicinal plants","native French","GNS UR","category of use","frequency of use","time of use","French speaking","French native speakers","broad spectrum of medicinal plants","FNS","corresponding use reports","target animal species","ethnoveterinary knowledge of farmers","farmers satisfaction","restricted use of antibiotics","native German speakers","German native speakers","Homemade Single Species Herbal Remedy Reports","German speaking","veterinary research","gastrointestinal diseases","skin diseases","horses","range of veterinary medicinal products","European veterinary medicine","homemade remedies","treatment of gastrointestinal","treatment of cattle","skin afflictions","homemade herbal remedies","bilingual regions of Switzerland","spectrum of veterinary therapeutic options","Western region of Switzerland","source of knowledge","earlier studies","HSHR","total","account earlier ethnoveterinary studies","antibiotic treatments","clear differences","pre-antibiotic era","dermatological disorders","dosage","route of administration","manufacturing process","Hypericum perforatum","Emergence of multidrug resistant bacterial strains","Sanicula europaea","Coffea","Calendula officinalis","Jura","dialog partners","decades","Matricaria chamomilla","cantons of Fribourg","Linum usitatissimum","Detailed information","Camellia sinensis","Kuntze","need","Quercus robur","practice","semistructured interviews","certain degree","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE","official strategies","respective language group","Neuch\u00E2tel","survey","botanical families","antimicrobials","canton of Bern","METHODS","measure","STUDY","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","Additional focus","livestock","MATERIAL","AIM","findings","majority"],"language":"en"},

The proportion of ILI attributable to adenovirus is not known. Moreover, knowledge gaps remain with respect to the epidemiologic, virologic, and clinical characteristics of adenovirus\u2010associated ILI among otherwise healthy individuals. METHODS: An observational, longitudinal study of \u003C65\u2010year\u2010old patients with febrile ILI at five medical centers was conducted from 2009 to 2014. Nasopharyngeal specimens obtained at enrollment were first tested by single\u2010reaction PCR for adenovirus, then further evaluated by a multiplex PCR assay for other respiratory viral pathogens. Symptoms over a 28\u2010day period were collected. RESULTS: We enrolled 1536 individuals, among whom 43 (2\u00B78%) were positive for adenovirus. The median age of cases was 3\u00B74 years (range: 4 months to 41 years). Three were hospitalized. Species and serotype information was available for 33 (76\u00B77%) cases. Species C (n = 21) was the most common, followed by B3 (n = 9) and one each of E4a, D46, and A. Species C infections were more frequent in children (P \u003C 0\u00B701). Half of the cases were positive for at least one other respiratory viral pathogen. Symptoms were generally mild and most commonly included cough (90%), fatigue (79%), rhinorrhea (74%), loss of appetite (71%), and sore throat (64%). Children with non\u2010C adenovirus infection were more likely to report sore throat (P = 0\u00B705) and hoarseness (P = 0\u00B706) than those with species C infection. CONCLUSIONS: Adenovirus is frequently detected with other respiratory viruses.

Joo et al., 1996, J. Virol. 70, 5769\u20135776). However, the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts are poor templates for positive-strand DI RNA synthesis. The present study demonstrated that DI RNA accumulation from the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts in MHV-infected cells was enhanced by the coexpression of complementary RNA transcripts that correspond to the 5\u2032 region of positive-strand DI RNA. The positive-strand RNA transcripts corresponding to the 5\u2032 end-most 0.7\u20132.0 kb DI RNA had a similar enhancement effect. The coexpressed positive-strand RNA transcripts lacking the leader sequence or those containing only the leader sequence failed to demonstrate this enhancement effect, demonstrating that the presence of the leader sequence in the coexpressed positive-strand RNA transcripts was necessary, but not sufficient, for the enhancement of DI RNA accumulation from the coexpressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts. Negative-strand DI RNA transcripts that were coexpressed with the partial-length positive-strand RNA transcripts were no more stable than those expressed alone, suggesting that a higher stability of the expressed negative-strand RNA transcripts was an unlikely reason for the higher DI RNA accumulation in cells coexpressing two complementary DI RNA transcripts. Sequence analyses unexpectedly demonstrated that the leader sequence of the majority of accumulated DI RNAs switched to helper virus derived leader sequence, suggesting that enhancement of DI RNA accumulation was mediated by the efficient utilization of helper virus derived leader sequence for DI RNA synthesis. Furthermore, our data suggested that this leader switching, a type of homologous RNA\u2013RNA recombination, occurred during positive-strand DI RNA synthesis and that MHV positive-strand RNA synthesis mechanism may have a preference toward recognizing double-stranded RNA structures over single-stranded negative-strand RNA to produce positive-strand DI RNAs.","publish_time":"2001-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Sangeeta; Repass, John F.; Makino, Shinji","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0629cf8debae5525cad41e5532cb84601ad472b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682201910475; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682201910475","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["J.

In this study, unwinding of DNA substrates that had different duplex lengths and 5\u2032-overhangs was examined under single-turnover reaction conditions in the presence of excess enzyme. The amount of DNA unwound decreased significantly as the length of the duplex increased, indicating a poor in vitro processivity. However, the quantity of duplex DNA unwound increased as the length of the single-stranded 5\u2032-tail increased for the 50-bp duplex. This enhanced processivity was also observed for duplex DNA that had a longer single-stranded gap in between. These results demonstrate that nsP13 requires the presence of a long 5\u2032-overhang to unwind longer DNA duplexes.

Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Biao; Wang, Xia; Li, Qian; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Tang, Sanyi; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong","journal":"J Clin Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7074281.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32046137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["control reproduction number","Beijing","nCoV infection","basic reproduction number","number of infected individuals","effect of travel restriction","Wuhan","quarantine","resource-intensive measures","outbreak","intervention measures","restrictive measures","imported exposed individuals","type of disease interventions","model analysis","significant low peak value","baseline value","intensive contact tracing","deterministic compartmental model","transmission risk","epidemiological status","novel coronavirus","mathematical modeling","severity","China","critical information","clinical progression","Chinese authorities","isolation","potential","cases","estimations","likelihood","prevention","intensity","days","scenario","neighboring countries","provinces","Sensitivity analyses","emergence","weeks"],"language":"en"},

No prior studies using molecular techniques to examine RSV transmission in the community childcare setting have been performed. OBJECTIVES: We seek to characterize the molecular epidemiology of RSV transmission in childcare to evaluate the impact of RSV disease in a community-based population. METHODS: We sequenced RSV-positive nasopharyngeal samples from a prospective longitudinal study of respiratory illnesses among children enrolled in childcare during three winter seasons. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to identify unique viral strains. RESULTS: RSV was detected in 59 (11%) illnesses. Compared to RSV-negative illnesses, RSV-positive illnesses were associated with longer symptom duration and increased frequency of health care visits. Another respiratory virus was detected in 42 (71%) RSV-positive illnesses. RSV viral load did not differ between RSV-positive illnesses with and without another respiratory virus identified (P = 0.38). In two childcare rooms, 50% of the children had RSV detected within six days of the first case. Five (38%) of 13 illness episodes from one childcare room were sequenced and shown to be the same viral strain, suggesting rapid child-to-child transmission within the room over a 16 day period. CONCLUSIONS: RSV is rapidly transmitted within childcare. Childcare facilities may serve as ideal sites for evaluation of new prevention strategies given the high burden of RSV disease in this population and the rapidity of RSV spread between children.","publish_time":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Helen Y.; Kuypers, Jane; Renaud, Christian; Wald, Anna; Martin, Emily; Fairchok, Mary; Magaret, Amalia; Sarancino, Misty; Englund, Janet A.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6dc7180cae1924619f06d26035133b2ff1fca205.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c8ca84902cd376bcd4504ce2e871c64bb63c85d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3800193.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653213001510; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3800193?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2013.04.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23684816/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653213001510","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV-positive illnesses","rapidity of RSV","RSV-negative illnesses","RSV viral load","impact of RSV disease","RSV-positive nasopharyngeal samples","molecular epidemiology of RSV transmission","high burden of RSV disease","respiratory virus","Childcare facilities","childcare rooms","community childcare setting","Respiratory syncytial virus","prospective longitudinal study of respiratory illnesses","child transmission","young children","important cause of serious respiratory infections","community-based population","unique viral strains","rapid child","molecular techniques","longer symptom duration","evaluation of new prevention strategies","ideal sites","increased frequency of health care visits","BACKGROUND","prior studies","illness episodes","days","Phylogenetic analysis","winter seasons","day period","METHODS","case","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, a thermoanalytical approach previously developed for quantifying trace levels of polymorphic impurity (form II metastable nuclei) in commercial salmeterol xinafoate powders has been successfully applied with slight modifications to ribavirin, an antiviral drug exhibiting roughly similar polymorph-dependent crystallization kinetics in melts to that of salmeterol xinafoate. Essentially, the approach involved modeling of the crystallization kinetics of both tested and reference drug materials in melts using the Avrami-Erofe\u2019ev (AE) rate expression, derivation of a mathematical equation for relating the AE kinetic constant to the composition of reference polymorph mixtures, and the use of this derived equation (in the form of a calibration curve) to calculate the impurity contents of the tested samples from their computed AE constants. For ribavirin, modification of the latter equation by incorporation of an empirical exponent was found necessary to account for the composition-dependent changes in crystallization kinetics of the reference mixtures. Such modification has made possible the determination of polymorphic impurity content of as low as 0.004% (w/w) in ribavirin samples induced by different forms of grinding treatment.","publish_time":"2005-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tong, Henry H.Y.; Shekunov, Boris Y.; Chan, John P.; Mok, Cedric K.F.; Hung, Henry C.M.; Chow, Albert H.L.","journal":"International Journal of Pharmaceutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49e8d40d0a2de07dff651a40943120beb75cfd14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125510.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517305001584; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517305001584","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reference drug materials","ribavirin samples","reference mixtures","composition of reference polymorph mixtures","similar polymorph-dependent crystallization kinetics","quantifying trace levels of polymorphic impurity","antiviral drug","melts","impurity contents","mathematical equation","tested samples","derived equation","determination of polymorphic impurity content","AE kinetic constant","composition-dependent changes","computed AE constants","commercial salmeterol xinafoate powders","thermoanalytical approach","metastable nuclei","separate crystalline phases","rate expression","important issue","Avrami-Erofe\u2019ev","derivation","use","Abstract Accurate quantification of impurities","different forms of grinding treatment","empirical exponent","slight modifications","incorporation","calibration curve","pharmaceutical industry","present study"],"language":"en"},

Sporothrix schenckii is the etiological agent of human and animal sporotrichosis. Cats may act as reservoirs for S. schenckii and can transmit the infection to humans by a bite or scratch. There are few methods for the serological diagnosis of fungal diseases in animals. In this paper, an ELISA test for the diagnosis of cat sporotrichosis is proposed, which detects S. schenckii-specific antibodies in feline sera. Two different kinds of antigens were used: \u201CSsCBF\u201D, a specific molecule from S. schenckii that consists of a Con A-binding fraction derived from a peptido-rhamnomannan component of the cell wall, and a S. schenckii crude exoantigen preparation. The ELISA was developed, optimized, and evaluated using sera from 30 cats with proven sporotrichosis (by culture isolation); 22 sera from healthy feral cats from a zoonosis center were used as negative controls. SsCBF showed 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity in ELISA; while crude exoantigens demonstrated 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity. The ELISA assay described here would be a valuable screening tool for the detection of specific S. schenckii antibodies in cats with sporotrichosis. The assay is inexpensive, quick to perform, easy to interpret, and permits the diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis.","publish_time":"2011-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fernandes, Geisa Ferreira; Lopes-Bezerra, Leila Maria; Bernardes-Engemann, Andr\u00E9a Reis; Schubach, T\u00E2nia Maria Pacheco; Dias, Maria Adelaide Galv\u00E3o; Pereira, Sandro Antonio; Camargo, Zoilo Pires de","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbadd168f7dce1426d36dc47a6fafff31638ae73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125942.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20708355/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113510003421; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113510003421; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.07.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis","schenckii antibodies","schenckii-specific antibodies","diagnosis of cat sporotrichosis","Sporothrix schenckii","proven sporotrichosis","animal sporotrichosis","ELISA assay","feline sera","ELISA test","schenckii crude exoantigen preparation","detection of specific","healthy feral cats","specific molecule","sensitivity","SsCBF","specificity","serological diagnosis of fungal diseases","zoonosis center","etiological agent of human","cell wall","culture isolation","peptido-rhamnomannan component","valuable screening tool","animals","humans","bite","negative controls","methods","study","infection","binding fraction","different kinds of antigens","main objective","scratch","paper","reservoirs"],"language":"en"},

Interleukin (IL)-12, a crucial innate cytokine, was found to be regulated by such xenobiotic agents. This study aimed at testing whether IL-12 profiles may be indicative of heavy metals-induced immunomodulation. METHODS: Human immunocompetent cells, activated either by monoclonal antibodies or heat-killed Salmonella enterica, were cultured in the absence or presence of cadmium (Cd) acetate or mercuric (Hg) chloride. In vivo experiments were set up where BALB/c mice were exposed to sub-lethal doses of Cd or Hg salts for 3 or 5 weeks. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT-reduction assay. Modulation of cytokine profiles was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cytometric bead-based array (CBA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the relevance of these methods of cytokine quantification was explored. RESULTS: Modulation of IL-12 profiles in Cd- or Hg-exposed human PBMC was dose-dependent and significantly related to IFN-\u03B3 levels as well as to the Th1- or Th2-polarized responses. Similarly, skewing the Th1/Th2 ratios in vivo correlated significantly with up- or down-regulation of IL-12 levels in both cases of investigated metals. CONCLUSION: It can be inferred that: (i) IL-12 profiles alone may represent a relevant indicator of heavy metal-induced immune modulation; (ii) evaluating cytokine profiles by CBA is relevant and can adequately replace other methods such as ELISA and RT-PCR in basic research as well as in immune diagnostics; and (iii) targeting IL-12 in therapeutic approaches may be promising to modify Th1/Th2-associated immune disorders.","publish_time":"2008-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hemdan, Nasr YA","journal":"J Occup Med Toxicol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d80c3f53b8900bb8d958492553dc052c2b3c628.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2585571.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-6673-3-25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18990205/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CBA","ELISA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Modulation of IL","Modulation of cytokine profiles","regulation of IL","Th1","immune modulation","methods of cytokine quantification","ELISA","CBA","RT-PCR","Hg salts","indicative of heavy metals-induced immunomodulation","Hg-exposed human PBMC","Th2-polarized responses","immune disorders","immune diagnostics","crucial innate cytokine","Th2 ratios","relevant indicator of heavy metal","lethal doses of Cd","cases of investigated metals","Human immunocompetent cells","MTT-reduction assay","IFN-\u03B3 levels","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","real-time polymerase chain reaction","cytometric bead-based array","T helper cell","acetate","monoclonal antibodies","dose-dependent","basic research","relevance","presence of cadmium","Increasing evidence","Salmonella enterica","heat","absence","c mice","various pathological manifestation","BALB","BACKGROUND","chloride","testing","therapeutic approaches","Cytotoxicity","weeks","study","RESULTS","xenobiotic agents","experiments","Interleukin","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the predictors of chronic PTSD in SARS survivors. DESIGN: PTSD at 30 months after the SARS outbreak was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Survivors\u0027 demographic data, medical information and psychosocial variables were collected for risk factor analysis. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender as well as the presence of chronic medical illnesses diagnosed before the onset of SARS and avascular necrosis were independent predictors of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS. Associated factors included higher-chance external locus of control, higher functional disability and higher average pain intensity. CONCLUSION: The study of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS showed that the predictive value of acute medical variables may fade out. Our findings do not support some prior hypotheses that the use of high dose corticosteroids is protective against the development of PTSD. On the contrary, the adversity both before and after the SARS outbreak may be more important in hindering recovery from PTSD. The risk factor analysis can not only improve the detection of hidden psychiatric complications but also provide insight for the possible model of care delivery for the SARS survivors. With the complex interaction of the biopsychosocial challenges of SARS, an integrated multidisciplinary clinic setting may be a superior approach in the long-term management of complicated PTSD cases.","publish_time":"2010-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mak, Ivan Wing Chit; Chu, Chung Ming; Pan, Pey Chyou; Yiu, Michael Gar Chung; Ho, Suzanne C.; Chan, Veronica Lee","journal":"Gen Hosp Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132390.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163834310001453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21112450/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2010.07.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834310001453","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Structured Clinical Interview","PTSD","Associated"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS survivors","SARS outbreak","onset of SARS","months post-SARS","study of PTSD","development of PTSD","predictors of chronic PTSD","biopsychosocial challenges of SARS","independent predictors of PTSD","long-term management of complicated PTSD cases","risk factor analysis","medical information","predictive value of acute medical variables","presence of chronic medical illnesses","higher functional disability","survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome","higher average pain intensity","psychosocial variables","prevalent long-term psychiatric diagnoses","Post-traumatic stress disorder","Multivariate logistic regression analysis","higher-chance external locus of control","detection of hidden psychiatric complications","insight","superior approach","integrated multidisciplinary clinic setting","use of high dose corticosteroids","avascular necrosis","female gender","Survivors\u0027 demographic data","possible model of care delivery","Structured Clinical Interview","prior hypotheses","Associated factors","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","DSM-IV","complex interaction","hindering recovery","findings","OBJECTIVES","adversity","CONCLUSION","DESIGN"],"language":"en"},

Objectives To investigate the presence of HRV-C in fecal samples of children with gastroenteritis. Study design 734 fecal samples from hospitalized children with gastroenteritis were subject to picornavirus detection by RT-PCR of the conserved 5\u2032-NCR. Positive samples were subject to VP4 and 3Dpol gene analysis for species determination. The clinical and molecular epidemiology of HRV-C and other picornaviruses was analyzed. Results Picornaviruses were detected in 113 (15.4%) of 734 fecal samples from children with gastroenteritis by RT-PCR of 5\u2032-NCR, with 58 containing potential HRVs and 55 containing other enteroviruses. PCR of the VP4 and 3Dpol regions was positive in 21 and 19 samples respectively (both regions positive in 8 samples). Sequencing analysis showed the presence of HRV-C in four samples, and diverse picornaviruses including HRV-A (n =2), HEV-A (n =2), HEV-B (n =2), HEV-C (n =21) and HPeV (n =2) in other samples, with co-detection of HRV-C and HPeV in one sample. Of the four children with HRV-C detected in fecal samples, three presented with diarrhea in the absence of respiratory symptoms, while one also had acute bronchiolitis. The four HRV-C strains from fecal samples belonged to the existing clade of diverse HRV-C genotypes, indistinguishable from previous respiratory strains. Conclusions HRV-C can be detected in fecal samples of children with gastroenteritis, in the absence of respiratory symptoms. This study also represented the first to detect HPeV in our population.","publish_time":"2012-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Susanna K.P.; Yip, Cyril C.Y.; Lung, David Christopher; Lee, Paul; Que, Tak-Lun; Lau, Yu-Lung; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Woo, Patrick C.Y.; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfe64ba8bf59ab09b956b293c47a3798df11b31a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108355.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653212000133; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2012.01.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22317907/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653212000133","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV-C strains","Conclusions HRV-C","fecal samples of children","HEV-C","Positive samples","presence of HRV","association of HRV","co-detection of HRV","existing clade of diverse HRV-C genotypes","molecular epidemiology of HRV","gastroenteritis","hospitalized children","HPeV","absence of respiratory symptoms","RT-PCR","diverse picornaviruses","regions positive","previous respiratory strains","VP4","Dpol regions","respiratory tract infections","HEV-B","NCR","Results Picornaviruses","Dpol gene analysis","picornavirus detection","species determination","Sequencing analysis","Study design","novel human rhinovirus species","recent discovery","diseases","diarrhea","Abstract Background","potential HRVs","enteroviruses","Objectives","acute bronchiolitis","population"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans.

As infections caused by influenza virus are often accompanied by infections with other respiratory viruses the combination of a specific anti-influenza compound with the broadly active antiviral polymer has huge potential for the treatment of respiratory infections. Thus, the combination of the specific anti-influenza drug Zanamivir together with carrageenan in a formulation suitable for intranasal application was evaluated in-vitro and in-vivo. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show in-vitro that carrageenan and Zanamivir act synergistically against several influenza A virus strains (H1N1(09)pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7). Moreover, we demonstrate in a lethal influenza model with a low pathogenic H7N7 virus (HA closely related to the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus) and a H1N1(09)pdm influenza virus in C57BL/6 mice that the combined use of both compounds significantly increases survival of infected animals in comparison with both mono-therapies or placebo. Remarkably, this benefit is maintained even when the treatment starts up to 72 hours post infection. CONCLUSION: A nasal spray containing carrageenan and Zanamivir should therefore be tested for prevention and treatment of uncomplicated influenza in clinical trials.","publish_time":"2015-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morokutti-Kurz, Martina; K\u00F6nig-Schuster, Marielle; Koller, Christiane; Graf, Christine; Graf, Philipp; Kirchoff, Norman; Reutterer, Benjamin; Seifert, Jan-Marcus; Unger, Hermann; Grassauer, Andreas; Prieschl-Grassauer, Eva; Nakowitsch, Sabine","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0b1fa4036434b57c8307d43c39a4193f7e8053a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4459876.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0128794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26053018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pdm influenza virus","avian influenza","treatment of uncomplicated influenza","Carrageenan","treatment of respiratory infections","specific anti-influenza compound","lethal influenza model","specific anti-influenza drug Zanamivir","virus strains","treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections","low pathogenic H7N7 virus","combination","H1N1","Zanamivir act","respiratory viruses","vitro","marketed compound","huge potential","active antiviral polymer","comparison","compounds","survival of infected animals","mice","C57BL","intranasal application","formulation suitable","mono-therapies","combined use","H3N2","nasal spray","clinical trials","H7N9","prevention","CONCLUSION","H5N1","placebo","hours","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","BACKGROUND","benefit"],"language":"en"},

Over the past three years, Coronavirus HKU15 has been widely detected in pigs in East/Southeast Asia and North America and has been associated with fatal outbreaks. In all such epidemiological studies, the virus was generally only detected in fecal/intestinal samples. In this molecular epidemiology study, we detected Coronavirus HKU15 in 9.6% of the nasopharyngeal samples obtained from 249 pigs in Hong Kong. Samples that tested positive were mostly collected during winter. Complete genome sequencing of the Coronavirus HKU15 in two nasopharyngeal samples revealed quasispecies in one of the samples. Two of the polymorphic sites involved indels, but the other two involved transition substitutions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two nasopharyngeal strains in the present study were most closely related to the strains PDCoV/CHJXNI2/2015 from Jiangxi, China, and CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 from Sichuan, China. The outbreak strains in the United States possessed highly similar genome sequences and were clustered monophyletically, whereas the Asian strains were more diverse and paraphyletic. The detection of Coronavirus HKU15 in respiratory tracts of pigs implies that in addition to enteric infections, Coronavirus HKU15 may be able to cause respiratory infections in pigs and that in addition to fecal-oral transmission, the virus could possibly spread through the respiratory route. The presence of the virus in respiratory samples provides an alternative clinical sample to confirm the diagnosis of Coronavirus HKU15 infection. Quasispecies were unprecedentedly observed in the 5\u2032-untranslated region of coronavirus genomes.","publish_time":"2017-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woo, Patrick CY; Lau, Susanna KP; Tsang, Chi-Ching; Lau, Candy CY; Wong, Po-Chun; Chow, Franklin WN; Fong, Jordan YH; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2eef726fe46a8ddef327c78e7d5affbfd2fe69c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5584481.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2017.37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28634353/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["East/Southeast Asia","Hong Kong","China","United States","North America"],"keyphrases":["respiratory samples","detection of Coronavirus HKU15","fecal samples of pigs","nasopharyngeal samples","diagnosis of Coronavirus HKU15 infection","intestinal samples","nasopharyngeal strains","respiratory tracts of pigs","respiratory infections","untranslated region of coronavirus genomes","Asian strains","respiratory route","strains PDCoV","outbreak strains","addition","Sichuan","Hong Kong","China","quasispecies","fecal-oral transmission","enteric infections","present study","similar genome sequences","Complete genome sequencing","molecular epidemiology study","involved transition substitutions","United States","alternative clinical sample","Southeast Asia","North America","Jiangxi","CHJXNI2","S27","deltacoronavirus","indels","years","presence","Phylogenetic analysis","polymorphic sites","epidemiological studies","fatal outbreaks","winter"],"language":"en"},

Although MERS has low overall human-to-human transmission potential, there is occasional amplification in the healthcare setting, a pattern reminiscent of the dynamics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003. Here we provide a head-to-head comparison of exposure patterns and transmission dynamics of large hospital clusters of MERS and SARS, including the most recent South Korean outbreak of MERS in 2015. METHODS: To assess the unexpected nature of the recent South Korean nosocomial outbreak of MERS and estimate the probability of future large hospital clusters, we compared exposure and transmission patterns for previously reported hospital clusters of MERS and SARS, based on individual-level data and transmission tree information. We carried out simulations of nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS using branching process models rooted in transmission tree data, and inferred the probability and characteristics of large outbreaks. RESULTS: A significant fraction of MERS cases were linked to the healthcare setting, ranging from 43.5 % for the nosocomial outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2014 to 100 % for both the outbreak in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in 2013 and the outbreak in South Korea in 2015. Both MERS and SARS nosocomial outbreaks are characterized by early nosocomial super-spreading events, with the reproduction number dropping below 1 within three to five disease generations. There was a systematic difference in the exposure patterns of MERS and SARS: a majority of MERS cases occurred among patients who sought care in the same facilities as the index case, whereas there was a greater concentration of SARS cases among healthcare workers throughout the outbreak. Exposure patterns differed slightly by disease generation, however, especially for SARS. Moreover, the distributions of secondary cases per single primary case varied highly across individual hospital outbreaks (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test; P \u003C 0.0001), with significantly higher transmission heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases for MERS than SARS. Simulations indicate a 2-fold higher probability of occurrence of large outbreaks (\u003E100 cases) for SARS than MERS (2 % versus 1 %); however, owing to higher transmission heterogeneity, the largest outbreaks of MERS are characterized by sharper incidence peaks. The probability of occurrence of MERS outbreaks larger than the South Korean cluster (n = 186) is of the order of 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the South Korean outbreak followed a similar progression to previously described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses, with early super-spreading events generating a disproportionately large number of secondary infections, and the transmission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations. Differences in relative exposure patterns and transmission heterogeneity of MERS and SARS could point to changes in hospital practices since 2003 or differences in transmission mechanisms of these coronaviruses.

In regards to medical and economic importance, the biosynthesis and regulatory mechanism of the secondary metabolites in Lycoris remain uninvestigated. METHODS: BLAST was used to identify the sequence of tyrosine decarboxylase in the transcriptome of Lycoris aurea (L\u2019H\u00E9r) Herb. The enzyme activity of this TYDC was determined by using heterologous expressed protein in the Escherichia coli cells. The related productive contents of tyramine were detected using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). According to the available micro RNA sequencing profiles and degradome database of L. aurea, microRNA396 were isolated, which targets to LaTYDC1 and RNA Ligase-Mediated-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RLM-RACE) were used to confirm the cleavage. The expression levels of miR396 and LaTYDC1 were measured using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: LaTYDC1 was mainly expressed in root, bulb, leaf and flower fitting the models for galanthamine accumulation. This decarboxylase efficiently catalyzes tyrosine to tyramine conversion. Under methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, the expression of LaTYDC1 and the content of tyramine sharply increase. The use of RLM-RACE confirms that miR396 promotes the degradation of LaTYDC1 mRNA. Under MeJA treatment, the expression of miR396 was suppressed while the expression level of LaTYDC1 sharply increased. Following the increase of the miR396 transcriptional level, LaTYDC1 was significantly repressed. CONCLUSION: LaTYDC1 participates in the biosynthesis of galanthamine, and is regulated by miR396. This finding also provides genetic strategy for improving the yield of galanthamine in the future.","publish_time":"2019-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Rong; Han, Xiaokang; Xu, Sheng; Xia, Bing; Jiang, Yumei; Xue, Yong; Wang, Ren","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6474336.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024762/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Herb"],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of LaTYDC1","expression level of LaTYDC1","expression of miR396","expression levels of miR396","degradation of LaTYDC1 mRNA","biosynthesis of galanthamine","miR396 transcriptional level","MeJA treatment","yield of galanthamine","galanthamine accumulation","transcriptome of Lycoris aurea","Lycoris species","RLM-RACE","tyramine conversion","content of tyramine","increase","sequence of tyrosine decarboxylase","treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease","RNA Ligase","related productive contents of tyramine","use of RLM","heterologous expressed protein","available micro RNA sequencing profiles","degradome database of","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","flower","regulatory mechanism","economic importance","Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends","secondary metabolites","qRT-PCR","High Performance Liquid Chromatography","Escherichia coli cells","kind of Amaryllidaceae alkaloid","leaf","HPLC","microRNA396","models","root","L\u2019H\u00E9r","bulb","regards","methyl jasmonate","Herb","genetic strategy","BLAST","enzyme activity","future","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS","cleavage"],"language":"en"},

A systematic evaluation","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0191324","pmcid":"PMC5791979","pubmed_id":"29385161","license":"cc0","abstract":"BACKGROUND: As the deployment of electronic medical records (EMR) expands, so is the availability of long-term datasets that could serve to enhance public health surveillance. We hypothesized that EMR-based surveillance systems that incorporate seasonality and other long-term trends would discover outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI) sooner than systems that only consider the recent past. METHODS: We simulated surveillance systems aimed at discovering modeled influenza outbreaks injected into backgrounds of patients with ARI. Backgrounds of daily case counts were either synthesized or obtained by applying one of three previously validated ARI case-detection algorithms to authentic EMR entries. From the time of outbreak injection, detection statistics were applied daily on paired background\u002Binjection and background-only time series. The relationship between the detection delay (the time from injection to the first alarm uniquely found in the background\u002Binjection data) and the false-alarm rate (FAR) was determined by systematically varying the statistical alarm threshold. We compared this relationship for outbreak detection methods that utilized either 7 days (early aberrancy reporting system (EARS)) or 2\u20134 years of past data (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time series modeling). RESULTS: In otherwise identical surveillance systems, SARIMA detected epidemics sooner than EARS at any FAR below 10%. The algorithms used to detect single ARI cases impacted both the feasibility and marginal benefits of SARIMA modeling. Under plausible real-world conditions, SARIMA could reduce detection delay by 5\u201316 days. It also was more sensitive at detecting the summer wave of the 2009 influenza pandemic. CONCLUSION: Time series modeling of long-term historical EMR data can reduce the time it takes to discover epidemics of ARI. Realistic surveillance simulations may prove invaluable to optimize system design and tuning.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Hongzhang; Woodall, William H.; Carlson, Abigail L.; DeLisle, Sylvain","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e43ae4e86302c1a05c8a22675a192245626fa9ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5791979.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0191324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29385161/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARI","EMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["time of outbreak injection","detection delay","injection data","EMR-based surveillance systems","epidemics of ARI","identical surveillance systems","Time series modeling of long-term historical EMR data","detection statistics","validated ARI case-detection algorithms","outbreak detection methods","paired background","single ARI cases","Realistic surveillance simulations","public health surveillance","marginal benefits of SARIMA modeling","years of past data","authentic EMR entries","long-term trends","days","relationship","Backgrounds of daily case counts","modeled influenza outbreaks","availability of long-term datasets","false-alarm rate","statistical alarm threshold","system design","influenza pandemic","backgrounds of patients","recent past","outbreaks of acute respiratory infections","early aberrancy reporting system","seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average","feasibility","seasonality","deployment of electronic medical records","summer wave","plausible real-world conditions","CONCLUSION","tuning","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Although vaccines have been developed, antiviral therapy is an important complement that cannot be substituted. Because of the lack of specific approved treatment, it is urgent to facilitate the cascade of further understanding of the infection biology, identification of druggable targets and the final development of effective antiviral therapies. PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway plays a vital role in regulating the infection course of many viruses. In this study, we have dissected the effects of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway on rotavirus infection using both conventional cell culture models and a 3D model of human primary intestinal organoids. We found that PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling is essential in sustaining rotavirus infection. Thus, blocking the key elements of this pathway, including PI3K, mTOR and 4E-BP1, has resulted in potent anti-rotavirus activity. Importantly, a clinically used mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, potently inhibited both experimental and patient-derived rotavirus strains. This effect involves 4E-BP1 mediated induction of autophagy, which in turn exerts anti-rotavirus effects. These results revealed new insights on rotavirus-host interactions and provided new avenues for antiviral drug development.","publish_time":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Yuebang; Dang, Wen; Zhou, Xinying; Xu, Lei; Wang, Wenshi; Cao, Wanlu; Chen, Sunrui; Su, Junhong; Cai, Xuepeng; Xiao, Shaobo; Peppelenbosch, Maikel P.; Pan, Qiuwei","journal":"Virulence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/485b745f048cbac696175c1ca05eee8fb46ba026.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5955461.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28475412/; https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2017.1326443","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sustaining rotavirus infection","Akt-mTOR","anti-rotavirus effects","PI3K-Akt","infection biology","pathway","rotavirus-host interactions","infection course","mTOR inhibitor","effects of PI3K","potent anti-rotavirus activity","patient-derived rotavirus strains","antiviral drug development","antiviral therapy","final development of effective antiviral therapies","new avenues","new insights","E-BP1 mediated induction of autophagy","particular cases of immunocompromised patients","infants younger","major cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea","identification of druggable targets","conventional cell culture models","y old","D model of human primary intestinal organoids","turn","vital role","understanding","lack of specific approved treatment","important complement","age","cascade","rapamycin","results","key elements","vaccines","viruses","study"],"language":"en"},

It is unknown what made staff provide CS despite the risks of contracting EVD. This study explores Sierra Leonean health worker perspectives of why they continued to provide CS. METHODS: This qualitative study documents the experiences of 15 CS providers who worked during the EVD outbreak. We interviewed surgical and non-surgical CS providers who worked at public hospitals that either increased or decreased CS volumes during the outbreak. Hospitals in all four administrative areas of Sierra Leone were included. Semistructured interviews averaged 97 min and healthcare experience 21 years. Transcripts were analysed by modified framework analysis in the NVivo V.11.4.1 software. RESULTS: We identified two themes that may explain why providers performed CS despite EVD risks: (1) clinical adaptability and (2) overcoming the moral dilemmas. CS providers reported being overworked and exposed to infection hazards. However, they developed clinical workarounds to the lack of surgical materials, protective equipment and standard operating procedures until the broader international response introduced formal personal protective equipment and infection prevention and control practices. CS providers reported that dutifulness and sense of responsibility for one\u2019s community increased during EVD, which helped them justify taking the risk of being infected. Although most surgical activities were reduced to minimise staff exposure to EVD, staff at public hospitals tended to prioritise performing CS surgery for women with acute obstetric complications. CONCLUSION: This study found that CS surgery during EVD in Sierra Leone may be explained by remarkable decisions by individual CS providers at public hospitals. They adapted practically to material limitations exacerbated by the outbreak and overcame the moral dilemmas of performing CS despite the risk of being infected with EVD.","publish_time":"2019-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drevin, Gustaf; M\u00F6lsted Alvesson, Helle; van Duinen, Alex; Bolkan, H\u00E5kon A; Koroma, Alimamy P; Von Schreeb, Johan","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4e3ea0a718f906e5f879917d26384c2c0c49d09.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4f8881d84a2dc68828437d1778e841a3fbf6e2b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6666802.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2018-001361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CS","EVD","Sierra Leonean"],"locations":["Sierra Leone"],"keyphrases":["CS surgery","individual CS providers","EVD outbreak","non-surgical CS providers","decreased CS volumes","EVD risks","public hospitals","risks of contracting EVD","surgical activities","administrative areas of Sierra Leone","lack of surgical materials","staff exposure","qualitative study","moral dilemmas","Sierra Leonean health worker perspectives","formal personal protective equipment","infection prevention","clinical workarounds","infection hazards","clinical adaptability","Routine health service provision","broader international response","standard operating procedures","caesarean section","remarkable decisions","women","rates","acute obstetric complications","control practices","modified framework analysis","sense of responsibility","Ebola virus disease","NVivo","INTRODUCTION","dutifulness","experiences","healthcare experience","Transcripts","community","Semistructured interviews","years","software","METHODS","material limitations","themes","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Resistance is often an issue with drugs directed at viral proteins and for small RNA viruses there are also a limited number of viral proteins that are amenable to inhibition by a small molecule. A new approach that is gaining support is that cellular proteins, which facilitate virus replication, may be used as alternative targets. Whereas drugs directed at viral proteins tend to be virus-specific, drugs directed at host targets have the potential to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity as many viruses may share a dependency on that host function. For influenza virus, we have very limited knowledge of which cellular factors are involved in virus replication, let alone which of these have suitable properties to serve as drug targets. Through the use of high-throughput RNA interference screens, several studies have addressed this gap in our knowledge. The resulting datasets provide new insight into host pathways that are involved in the influenza virus replication cycle and identify specific host factors in these pathways that may serve as potential targets for future antiviral drug development.","publish_time":"2011-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaw, Megan L.","journal":"Reviews in Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1492e48677f7e0ac9b82b18d69222d15134db7b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/958af8f09242ea401aaab56607a20b0db08b02d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3207218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21823192/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3207218?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.703","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host targets","virus-specific","drug targets","cellular proteins","host pathways","potential targets","influenza virus replication cycle","drugs","specific host factors","antiviral drug resistance","limited number of viral proteins","host function","alternative targets","small RNA viruses","cellular factors","future antiviral drug development","limited knowledge","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","new insight","small molecule","new approach","throughput RNA interference screens","availability","studies","inhibition","major concern","use of high","resulting datasets","support","issue","protective vaccine","pandemic setting","dependency","suitable properties","gap"],"language":"en"},

While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. METHODS: We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. RESULTS: While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-cohort of countries with higher medical standards. Further analyses demonstrate a significantly lower proportion of reported COVID-19 cases without travel history to China in countries with lower HAQ (HAQ I vs. HAQ II, posthoc p \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that countries with lower HAQ-index may either underreport COVID-19 cases or are unable to adequately detect them. Although our data may be incomplete and must be interpreted with caution, inconsistencies in reporting COVID-19 cases is a serious problem which might sabotage efforts to contain the virus.","publish_time":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Ichii, Hirohito; Schubert, Justyna; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja","journal":"J Microbiol Immunol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80535e36aad1b9f72d55be05846e9f93a25145b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102572.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300736; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220300736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32205091/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Healthcare Access"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["China","reporting COVID","HAQ-cohort","lower HAQ-index","countries","unreported international COVID","travel history","development of international COVID","increasing number of cases","number of non-travel related COVID","lower proportion of reported COVID","travel background","Quality Index","available data","developments support concerns","Healthcare Access","flight restrictions","higher medical standards","pandemic","caution","cohorts","inconsistencies","Wuhan","serious problem","new local disease epicenters","World Health Organization","efforts","outbreak","Chi-square","testing","analyses","CONCLUSIONS","country","RESULTS","virus","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

No effective antiviral drugs against it are commercially available. We recently reported that the culture supernatant of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the porcine pleuropneumonia causative agent, has an antiviral activity in vitro against PRRSV in SJPL cells. Objectives of this study were (i) to identify the mechanism behind the antiviral activity displayed by A. pleuropneumoniae and (ii) to characterize the active molecules present in the bacterial culture supernatant. METHODS: Antibody microarray analysis was used in order to point out cellular pathways modulated by the A. pleuropneumoniae supernatant. Subsequent, flow cytometry analysis and cell cycle inhibitors were used to confirm antibody microarray data and to link them to the antiviral activity of the A. pleuropneumoniae supernatant. Finally, A. pleuropneumoniae supernatant characterization was partially achieved using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Using antibody microarray, we observed modulations in G2/M-phase cell cycle regulation pathway when SJPL cells were treated with A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant. These modulations were confirmed by a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase when cells were treated with the A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant. Furthermore, two G2/M-phase cell cycle inhibitors demonstrated the ability to inhibit PRRSV infection, indicating a potential key role for PRRSV infection. Finally, mass spectrometry lead to identify two molecules (m/z 515.2 and m/z 663.6) present only in the culture supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated for the first time that A. pleuropneumoniae is able to disrupt SJPL cell cycle resulting in inhibitory activity against PRRSV. Furthermore, two putative molecules were identified from the culture supernatant. This study highlighted the cell cycle importance for PRRSV and will allow the development of new prophylactic or therapeutic approaches against PRRSV.

Many natural compounds have already been found to exhibit significant anti-tumor effects. Lycorine, a natural alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae, exhibited anti-leukemia effects in vitro and in vivo. The survival rate of HL-60 cells exposed to lycorine was decreased, cell growth was slowed down, and cell regeneration potential was inhibited. HL-60 cells exhibited typical apoptotic characteristic. Lycorine can suppress leukemia growth and reduce cell survival and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. The purpose of this work is to elucidate the mechanism by which lycorine induces APL cells. RESULTS: When HL-60 cells were treated with different concentration of lycorine, the expression of p21 and TNF-\u03B1 was up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner as shown by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Lycorine also down-regulated p21-related gene expression, including Cdc2, Cyclin B, Cdk2 and Cyclin E, promoted Bid truncation, decreased I\u03BAB phosphorylation and blocked NF-\u03BAB nuclear import. Cytochrome c was released from mitochondria as observed with confocal laser microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The TNF-\u03B1 signal transduction pathway and p21-mediated cell-cycle inhibition were involved in the apoptosis of HL-60 cells induced by lycorine. These results contribute to the development of new lycorine-based anti-leukemia drugs.","publish_time":"2010-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jing; Hu, Ji-liang; Shi, Bi-Wei; He, Yan; Hu, Wei-Xin","journal":"Cancer Cell Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/217e7ecb495478a12b89de6ab9d03e629f478752.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2924328.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20682078/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2867-10-25","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["leukemia growth","APL cells","anti-leukemia effects","different concentration of lycorine","anti-leukemia drugs","development of new lycorine","apoptosis of tumor cells","cell survival","cell growth","acute promyelogenous leukemia","common type of leukemia","expression of p21","p21-mediated cell-cycle inhibition","significant anti-tumor effects","cell regeneration potential","RESULTS","regulated p21-related gene expression","Cyclin E","Cyclin B","survival rate","natural alkaloid","natural compounds","TNF-\u03B1 signal transduction pathway","decreased I\u03BAB phosphorylation","concentration-dependent manner","real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","Bid truncation","blocked NF-\u03BAB nuclear import","Cdc2","Cdk2","mitochondria","Amaryllidaceae","Western blotting","life-threatening cancers","mechanism","confocal laser microscopy","CONCLUSIONS","typical apoptotic characteristic","work","Cytochrome c","purpose","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The results of this study confirm the anticryptosporidial activity of HFL in calves, but show that the outcome of infection following preventive treatment is comparable to that observed in calves treated after the onset of symptoms.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klein, Pavel","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/795a5e13033978fe1a59213b0962327439a1c8f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110609.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023307001724; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023307001724","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFL"],"locations":["Central Bohemia","Czech Republic"],"keyphrases":["treated groups","day-old calves","infected calves","corresponding placebo groups","time of onset","outcome of infection","study","onset of symptoms","days of age","anticryptosporidial activity of HFL","preventive treatment","intensity of diarrhoea","Czech Republic","lactate","Central Bohemia","therapeutic efficacy of halofuginone","dairy farm","clinical pattern of cryptosporidiosis","animals","Cryptosporidium parvum","faecal oocyst count","manner","results","contrast","drug","difference"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a porcine astrovirus (PAstV) strain, designated as PAstV JWH-1, is identified from a diarrheal pig in China, and it is partially characterized genetically. Sequence analysis shows that the PAstV JWH-1 strain contains divergent nucleotide sequences in both the open reading frame (ORF)1b/ORF2 consensus and the 3\u2032-UTR regions (s2m motif), which are usually highly conserved among members of the family Astroviridae. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the JWH-1 strain clusters closely with newly identified strains PAstV 12-4 and 14-4 and forms a group of mamastroviruses with the proposed novel deer astrovirus. Further recombination analysis shows that two possible interspecies recombination events between porcine and deer astroviruses occurred in the genome of the JWH-1 strain. This study further confirms that multiple lineages are present among PAstVs, and each lineage likely represents an independent origin. Additionally, the possibility of interspecies transmission among PAstVs is also suggested.","publish_time":"2011-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lan, Daoliang; Ji, Wenhui; Shan, Tongling; Cui, Li; Yang, Zhibiao; Yuan, Congli; Hua, Xiuguo","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b647d0b217a44c5b5ea4f5cdec8dfc2ff79e1afe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086730.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21688105/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-011-1050-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PAstV JWH","strain clusters","recombination analysis","identified strains PAstV","porcine astrovirus","PAstVs","Sequence analysis","Phylogenetic analysis","study","possible interspecies recombination events","deer astroviruses","proposed novel deer astrovirus","possibility of interspecies transmission","divergent nucleotide sequences","open reading frame","group of mamastroviruses","multiple lineages","genome","number of human zoonotic diseases","long-term persistence","UTR regions","ORF2 consensus","members","family Astroviridae","wide range of viruses","s2m motif","reservoirs","diarrheal pig","China","independent origin","animals","Pigs"],"language":"en"},

We have used molecular epidemiology to define the patterns of spread of the virus in Hong Kong and beyond. Methods The case definition of SARS was based on that recommended by WHO. We genetically sequenced the gene for the S1 unit of the viral spike protein of viruses from patients with SARS in Hong Kong (138) and Guangdong (three) in February to April, 2003. We undertook phylogenetic comparisons with 27 other sequences available from public databases (Genbank). Findings Most of the Hong Kong viruses (139/142), including those from a large outbreak in an apartment block, clustered closely together with the isolate from a single index case (HKU-33) who came from Guangdong to Hong Kong in late February. Three other isolates were genetically distinct from HKU-33 in Hong Kong during February, but none of these contributed substantially to the subsequent local outbreak. Viruses identified in Guangdong and Beijing were genetically more diverse. Interpretation The molecular epidemiological evidence suggests that most SARS-CoV from the outbreak in Hong Kong, as well as the viruses from Canada, Vietnam, and Singapore, are genetically closely linked. Three viruses found in Hong Kong in February were phylogenetically distinct from the major cluster, which suggests that several introductions of the virus had occurred, but that only one was associated with the subsequent outbreak in Hong Kong, which in turn spread globally.","publish_time":"2004-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guan, Y; Peiris, JSM; Zheng, B; Poon, LLM; Chan, KH; Zeng, FY; Chan, CWM; Chan, MN; Chen, JD; Chow, KYC; Hon, CC; Hui, KH; Li, J; Li, VYY; Wang, Y; Leung, SW; Yuen, KY; Leung, FC","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/122837950d45baa7b2d09f8e7437394ceaf5032e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112497.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673603152592; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603152592","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Guangdong","Beijing","Canada","Vietnam","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Hong Kong viruses","SARS-CoV","subsequent outbreak","Guangdong","case definition of SARS","large outbreak","subsequent local outbreak","viral spike protein of viruses","HKU","molecular epidemiology","single index case","molecular epidemiological evidence","patients","sequences available","Summary Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome","S1 unit","novel coronavirus","public databases","Genbank","apartment block","emerged disease","phylogenetic comparisons","Interpretation","patterns","Canada","Vietnam","Methods","Beijing","Findings","major cluster","Singapore","introductions","isolates","turn","countries"],"language":"en"},

However, it is sometimes difficult to identify IN/IBs, particularly in autolyzed tissues or samples from both early and late stages of infection, and other methods were presently developed. Methods: Stray dog samples were evaluated by histopathology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to investigate the status of the CAV\u20102 infection on the stray dogs in Korea. Histologic tests were performed, and dogs with pneumonic lungs were further evaluated by IHC and PCR. Results: Pathognomonic IN/IBs were identified in 3 of 213 lungs; CAV\u20102 PCR was positive for 27 of 213 pneumonic lungs. A total of 7 of 27 CAV\u20102 PCR\u2010positive lungs were IHC\u2010positive. No PCR\u2010negative lung was IHC\u2010positive.

Thus, fully understanding the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS is conducive to early identification and precise treatment. We aimed to describe the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS and to elucidate the differences from ARDS caused by other factors. COVID-19 mainly affected the respiratory system with minor damage to other organs. Injury to the alveolar epithelial cells was the main cause of COVID-19-related ARDS, and endothelial cells were less damaged with therefore less exudation. The clinical manifestations were relatively mild in some COVID-19 patients, which was inconsistent with the severity of laboratory and imaging findings. The onset time of COVID-19-related ARDS was 8\u201312 days, which was inconsistent with ARDS Berlin criteria, which defined a 1-week onset limit. Some of these patients might have a relatively normal lung compliance. The severity was redefined into three stages according to its specificity: mild, mild-moderate, and moderate-severe. HFNO can be safe in COVID-19-related ARDS patients, even in some moderate-severe patients. The more likely cause of death is severe respiratory failure.

Chlorogenic acid (CGA) has important biological and pharmacological activities. It is significant to develop a green and efficient method to extract GCA from Flos Lonicera japonica (FLJ) by integrating the advantages of the ionic liquids and enzymes. RESULTS: The optimal type of enzyme and ionic liquid was screened. Pectinase in [C6mim] Br aqueous phase was demonstrated to be an ideal combination. The parameters including extraction time, extraction temperature, pH, enzyme amount, and IL concentration were optimized systematically. Scanning electronic microscopy of FLJ samples demonstrated that pectinase and ionic liquid disposal both obviously facilitated the extraction process by destroying the structure of cell wall. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that ionic liquid enhanced the activity of the pectinase by altering its secondary structure. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous reported methods, ionic liquid-based enzyme-assisted extraction of GCA from FLJ was proved to be efficient and practical, offering a higher yield in a shorter time. A novel process was proposed for the extraction of active component from natural resources.

However, it is unlikely that this outbreak will be the last. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychiatric morbidities in survivors of SARS. Method This is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak. Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale\u2013Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Results Ninety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%. Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%. Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%. One-fourth of the patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15.6% had depressive disorders. Conclusion The outbreak of SARS can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe. PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorders. Our results highlight the need to enhance preparedness and competence of health care professionals in detecting and managing the psychological sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mak, Ivan Wing Chit; Chu, Chung Ming; Pan, Pey Chyou; Yiu, Michael Gar Chung; Chan, Veronica Lee","journal":"General Hospital Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9d125910f476ccc975921c0b2b39c096379cf32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112501.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163834309000474; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2009.03.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834309000474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19555791/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Structured Clinical Interview","the Medical Outcomes","Short-Form Health Survey"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS outbreak","outbreak of SARS","survivors of SARS","SARS survivors","psychiatric disorders","months post-SARS","psychiatric complications","long-term psychiatric morbidities","Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM","prevalent long-term psychiatric condition","depressive disorders","massive infectious disease outbreak","DSM-IV","Medical Outcomes Study","cohort study","PTSD","Results","post-traumatic stress disorder","mental health catastrophe","Hospital Anxiety","competence of health care professionals","Depression Scale","Functional outcomes","Item Short-Form Health Survey","United Christian Hospital","Impact of Events Scale","psychological sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks","preparedness","Abstract Objective Severe acute respiratory syndrome","Structured Clinical Interview","patients","need","Current prevalence","century","subjects","Method","Conclusion","response rate"],"language":"en"},

METHOD: The case was described in clinical expression, chest radiography, blood test and treatment. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect H5N6 virus RNA in clinical and environment samples. Epidemiological investigation was performed including case exposure history determinant, close contacts follow up, and environment sample collection. RESULTS: The patient initially developed sore throat and coughs on 27 January 2015. The disease progressed to severe pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. And the patient died on 6 February. A highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N6 virus was isolated from the tracheal aspirate specimen of the patient. The viral genome analyses revealed that the H5 hemmagglutinin gene belongs to 2.3.4.4 clade. Epidemiological investigation showed that the patient had exposure to wild bird. All close contacts of the patient did not present the same disease in seven consecutive days. A high H5 positive rate was detected in environmental samples from local live poultry markets.

JEV infection induced G1 arrest and activated CHK2. Inactivation of CHK2 and its upstream ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase in JEV-infected cells by using inhibitors reduced virus replication. Likewise, JEV replication was significantly decreased by knockdown of CHK2 expression with shRNA-producing lentiviral transduction.

These risks are often related, but not limited, to transmissible pathogens. Mobile populations can link zones of disease emergence to lowprevalence or nonendemic areas through rapid or high-volume international movements, or both. Against this background of human movement, other global processes such as economics, trade, transportation, environment and climate change, as well as civil security influence the health impacts of disease emergence. Concurrently, global information systems, together with regulatory frameworks for disease surveillance and reporting, affect organizational and public awareness of events of potential public health significance. International regulations directed at disease mitigation and control have not kept pace with the growing challenges associated with the volume, speed, diversity, and disparity of modern patterns of human movement. The thesis that human population mobility is itself a major determinant of global public health is supported in this article by review of the published literature from the perspective of determinants of health (such as genetics/biology, behavior, environment, and socioeconomics), population-based disease prevalence differences, existing national and international health policies and regulations, as well as inter-regional shifts in population demographics and health outcomes. This paper highlights some of the emerging threats and risks to public health, identifies gaps in existing frameworks to manage health issues associated with migration, and suggests changes in approach to population mobility, globalization, and public health. The proposed integrated approach includes a broad spectrum of stakeholders ranging from individual health-care providers to policy makers and international organizations that are primarily involved in global health management, or are influenced by global health events.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gushulak, BD; Weekers, J; MacPherson, DW","journal":"Emerg Health Threats J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b817c40ff2740be4fb203fbef15d27aa6e25c299.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3167650.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22460280/; https://doi.org/10.3134/ehtj.09.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health issues","health outcomes","global health events","international health policies","global health management","emergence of public health threats","health impacts of disease emergence","potential public health significance","major determinant of global public health","International population mobility","individual health-care providers","human population mobility","International regulations","disease surveillance","disease mitigation","zones of disease emergence","population demographics","public awareness of events","international organizations","global processes","risks","population-based disease prevalence differences","high-volume international movements","global information systems","existing frameworks","environment","background of human movement","disparity of modern patterns of human movement","regulatory frameworks","emerging threats","proposed integrated approach","nonendemic areas","reporting","policy makers","broad spectrum of stakeholders","underlying factor","trade","lowprevalence","civil security influence","gaps","inter-regional shifts","published literature","diversity","transportation","climate change","genetics","article","socioeconomics","globalization","perspective of determinants","pace","speed","behavior","control","biology","migration","changes","growing challenges","Mobile populations","review","paper highlights","thesis","transmissible pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Methods An online survey was sent to school nurses (from state school nurse associations and/or state departments of education) between May and July 2011. Overall school pandemic preparedness scores were calculated by assigning 1 point for each item in the school\u0027s pandemic plan; the maximum score was 11. Linear regression was used to describe factors associated with higher school pandemic preparedness scores. Nurse influenza vaccine uptake was assessed as well. Results A total of 1,997 nurses from 26 states completed the survey. Almost three-quarters (73.7%; n = 1,472) reported receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine during the 2010-11 season. Very few (2.2%; n = 43) reported that their school/district had a mandatory influenza vaccination policy. Pandemic preparedness scores ranged from 0 to 10 points, with an average score of 4.3. Determinants of school pandemic preparedness were as follows: planning to be a point of dispensing during a future pandemic (P \u003C .001), having experienced multiple student or employee hospitalizations and/or deaths related to H1N1 during the pandemic (P = .01 or \u003C.05, respectively), having a lead nurse complete the survey (P \u003C .001), and having the school nurse study participant be a member of the school disaster planning committee (P \u003C .001).

Membrane fractions prepared from a stably transfected hCD13-positive murine NIH/3T3 cell line were used to immunize BALB/c mice, with the intention that hCD13 would be the major immunogenic molecule recognized by the immune system. Spleen RNA from the immunized mice served to generate a combinatorial scFv phage display library. The library was adsorbed against non-transfected NIH/3T3 or Sf21 insect cells to eliminate nonrelevant binders. The supernatant was then used for panning with either hCD13-transfected Sf21 insect cells or a hCD13-expressing human leukemia-derived cell line. Therefore, the key concepts of the procedure were the presentation of hCD13 as the sole human antigen on murine NIH/3T3 cells and a screening strategy where hCD13 was the major common antigen of the material used for immunization and panning. Two different hCD13-reactive phages were isolated and the soluble scFvs were expressed in E. coli and purified. The two scFvs, anti-hCD13-1 and anti-hCD13-3, differed at four amino acid positions in their V(H) regions and both had high affinities for hCD13 as determined by surface plasmon resonance (K(D)=7 and 33\u00D710(\u221210) M, respectively). Both efficiently recognized hCD13 on intact cells. Therefore, the procedure allowed the production of high affinity scFvs reacting with a desired antigen in its native conformation without requiring extensive purification of the antigen and should be useful for the preparation of scFvs against other conformation-sensitive cell-surface antigens.","publish_time":"2001-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peipp, Matthias; Simon, Nicola; Loichinger, Alexandra; Baum, Wolfgang; Mahr, Kerstin; Zunino, Susan J.; Fey, Georg H.","journal":"J Immunol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41196f499004b5556ac6f96d012283e004521023.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172470.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175901002988; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175901002988","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-hCD13","recognized hCD13","presentation of hCD13","hCD13-transfected Sf21 insect cells","transfected hCD13-positive murine NIH","3T3 cells","different hCD13-reactive phages","intact cells","sole human antigen","desired antigen","3T3 cell line","procedure","major common antigen","extracellular domain of human cell surface antigen CD13","soluble scFvs","preparation of scFvs","non-transfected NIH","human leukemia-derived cell line","conformation-sensitive cell-surface antigens","production of high affinity scFvs","surface plasmon resonance","native conformation","immunized mice","high affinities","c mice","combinatorial scFv phage display library","major immunogenic molecule","antibody fragments","aminopeptidase N","recombinant single chain Fv","screening strategy","regions","material","extensive purification","BALB","nonrelevant binders","intention","amino acid positions","immune system","Spleen RNA","key concepts","Membrane fractions","coli","immunization","supernatant"],"language":"en"},

In the context of Article 14 of the revised European Bathing Waters Directive 2006/7/EC (rBWD, CEU, 2006) a Europe-wide surveillance study was carried out to determine the frequency of occurrence of two human enteric viruses in recreational waters. Adenoviruses were selected based on their near-universal shedding and environmental survival, and noroviruses (NoV) selected as being the most prevalent gastroenteritis agent worldwide. Concentration of marine and freshwater samples was done by adsorption/elution followed by molecular detection by (RT)-PCR. Out of 1410 samples, 553 (39.2%) were positive for one or more of the target viruses. Adenoviruses, detected in 36.4% of samples, were more prevalent than noroviruses (9.4%), with 3.5% GI and 6.2% GII, some samples being positive for both GI and GII. Of 513 human adenovirus-positive samples, 63 (12.3%) were also norovirus-positive, whereas 69 (7.7%) norovirus-positive samples were adenovirus-negative. More freshwater samples than marine water samples were virus-positive. Out of a small selection of samples tested for adenovirus infectivity, approximately one-quarter were positive. Sixty percent of 132 nested-PCR adenovirus-positive samples analysed by quantitative PCR gave a mean value of over 3000 genome copies per L of water. The simultaneous detection of infectious adenovirus and of adenovirus and NoV by (RT)PCR suggests that the presence of infectious viruses in recreational waters may constitute a public health risk upon exposure. These studies support the case for considering adenoviruses as an indicator of bathing water quality.","publish_time":"2011-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wyn-Jones, A.

Several pyrazoline derivatives have been found to possess diverse biological properties, which has stimulated research activity in this field. Areas covered: The present review sheds light on the recent therapeutic patent literature (2000 \u2013 2011) describing the applications of pyrazolines and their derivatives on selected activities. Many of the therapeutic applications of pyrazoline derivatives have been discussed, either in the patent or in the general literature areas in this review. In addition to selected biological data, a wide range of pharmaceutical applications and pharmaceutical compositions are also summarized. Expert opinion: Pyrazoline derivatives have numerous prominent pharmacological effects, such as antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal, antiamoebic, antimycobacterial), anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antidepressant and anticancer. Further pharmacological effects include cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists, antiepileptic, antitrypanosomal, antiviral activity, MAO-inhibitory, antinociceptive activity, insecticidal, hypotensive, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, antioxidant, steroidal and antidiabetic.

This potential, however, is undermined by the lack of effective methods to load exosomes with therapeutic proteins and to facilitate their uptake by target cells. Here, we demonstrate how a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) can both load protein cargo onto exosomes and increase their delivery ability via a pseudotyping mechanism. By fusing a set of fluorescent and luminescent reporters with VSVG, we show the successful targeting and incorporation of VSVG fusions into exosomes by gene transfection and fluorescence tracking. We subsequently validate our system by live cell imaging of VSVG and its participation in endosomes/exosomes that are ultimately released from transfected HEK293 cells. We show that VSVG pseudotyping of exosomes does not affect the size or distributions of the exosomes, and both the full-length VSVG and the VSVG without the ectodomain are shown to integrate into the exosomal membrane, suggesting that the ectodomain is not required for protein loading. Finally, exosomes pseudotyped with full-length VSVG are internalized by multiple-recipient cell types to a greater degree compared to exosomes loaded with VSVG without the ectodomain, confirming a role of the ectodomain in cell tropism. In summary, our work introduces a new genetically encoded pseudotyping platform to load and enhance the intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins via exosome-based vehicles to target cells.","publish_time":"2017-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, Conary; Losacco, Joseph; Stickney, Zachary; Li, Lingxuan; Marriott, Gerard; Lu, Biao","journal":"Int J Nanomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/949ec05f3fbd741cc6c4a08b2bcffdaa3d479866.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5402897.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s133430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28458537/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSVG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VSVG pseudotyping of exosomes","full-length VSVG","ectodomain","live cell imaging of VSVG","incorporation of VSVG fusions","target cells","cell tropism","mammalian cells","intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins","intracellular delivery of therapeutics","delivery ability","cell-derived nanovesicles","pseudotyping mechanism","transfected HEK293 cells","load protein cargo","multiple-recipient cell types","encoded pseudotyping platform","protein loading","exosome-based vehicles","gene transfection","greater degree","successful targeting","participation","vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein","work","luminescent reporters","fluorescence tracking","lack of effective methods","system","uptake","role","set of fluorescent","size","endosomes","summary","exosomal membrane","distributions","potential"],"language":"en"},

Diagnosis of the virus responsible for disease is essential to ensure patients receive appropriate clinical management. Very few real-time RT-PCR based assays are able to detect the presence of all members of these families using a single primer and probe set. We have developed a novel chemistry, 3base, which simplifies the viral nucleic acids allowing the design of RT-PCR assays capable of pan-family identification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Synthetic constructs, viral nucleic acids, intact viral particles and characterised reference materials were used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. Synthetic constructs demonstrated the sensitivities of the pan-flavivirus detection component were in the range of 13 copies per PCR. The pan-alphavirus assay had a sensitivity range of 10\u201325 copies per reaction depending on the viral strain. Lower limit of detection studies using whole virus particles demonstrated that sensitivity for assays was in the range of 1\u20132 copies per reaction. No cross reactivity was observed with a number of commonly encountered viral strains. Proficiency panels showed 100% concordance with the expected results and the assays performed as well as, if not better than, other assays used in laboratories worldwide. After initial assay validation the pan-viral assays were then tested during the 2016\u20132017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak. Positive results were detected in 116 positives from a total of 187 suspected dengue samples. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The pan-viral screening assays described here utilise a novel 3base technology and are shown to provide a sensitive and specific method to screen and thereafter speciate flavi- and/or alpha- viruses in clinical samples. The assays performed well in an outbreak situation and can be used to detect positive clinical samples containing any flavivirus or alphavirus in approximately 3 hours 30 minutes.","publish_time":"2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garae, Crystal; Kalo, Kalkoa; Pakoa, George Junior; Baker, Rohan; Isaacs, Phill; Millar, Douglas Spencer","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ce03de615e79f44ac9d8193429f9f6be86be3a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6968865.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31951602/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227550","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pan-viral assays","pan-viral screening assays","PCR assays capable of pan","viral strains","viral nucleic acids","intact viral particles","pan-alphavirus assay","sensitivity range","copies","positive clinical samples","pan-flavivirus detection component","virus particles","Synthetic constructs","real-time RT-PCR","suspected dengue samples","Positive results","reaction","appropriate clinical management","design of RT","virus responsible","family flaviviridae","family identification","novel chemistry","expected results","base technology","Vanuatu dengue","outbreak situation","initial assay validation","Lower limit of detection studies","diverse group of pathogens","alphaviridae","characterised reference materials","PRINCIPAL FINDING","families","disease","patients","sensitivities","single primer","significant morbidity","concordance","positives","METHODOLOGY","number","total","presence","alpha- viruses","SIGNIFICANCE","specific method","speciate flavi","probe set","members","mortality","Diagnosis","BACKGROUND","hours","specificity","Proficiency panels","cross reactivity","minutes","CONCLUSIONS","laboratories"],"language":"en"},

The spike protein (S1 subunit) is responsible for the molecular diversity of the virus and many sero/genotypes are described around the world. Recently a new standardized classification of the IBV molecular diversity was conducted, based on phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene sequences sampled worldwide. Brazil is one of the biggest poultry producers in the world and the present study aimed to review the molecular diversity and reconstruct the evolutionary history of IBV in the country. All IBV S1 gene sequences, with local and year of collection information available on GenBank, were retrieved. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out based on a maximum likelihood method for the classification of genotypes occurring in Brazil, according to the new classification. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed with the Brazilian clade and related international sequences to determine the evolutionary history of IBV in Brazil. A total of 143 Brazilian sequences were classified as GI-11 and 46 as GI-1 (Mass). Within the GI-11 clade, we have identified a potential recombinant strain circulating in Brazil. Phylodynamic analysis demonstrated that IBV GI-11 lineage was introduced in Brazil in the 1950s (1951, 1917\u20131975 95% HPD) and population dynamics was mostly constant throughout the time. Despite the national vaccination protocols, our results show the widespread dissemination and maintenance of the IBV GI-11 lineage in Brazil and highlight the importance of continuous surveillance to evaluate the impact of currently used vaccine strains on the observed viral diversity of the country.","publish_time":"2018-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fraga, Aline Padilha de; Gr\u00E4f, Tiago; Pereira, Cleiton Schneider; Ikuta, Nilo; Fonseca, Andr\u00E9 Salvador Kazantzi; Lunge, Vagner Ricardo","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/221e2cfa6736a5b3581327ba7dccea603e1d5e9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173207.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713481830114X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29574164/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.03.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156713481830114X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["IBV GI","IBV molecular diversity","IBV S1 gene sequences","evolutionary history of IBV","Brazilian sequences","classification of genotypes","new classification","phylogenetic analysis","observed viral diversity","related international sequences","S1 subunit","Brazilian clade","new standardized classification","lineage","results","world","country","Bayesian phylogenetic analyses","poultry industry","Phylodynamic analysis","biggest poultry producers","Avian infectious bronchitis virus","used vaccine strains","year of collection information available","impact","severe economic losses","widespread dissemination","maintenance","contagious disease","etiological agent","GenBank","present study","importance of continuous surveillance","maximum likelihood method","population dynamics","spike protein","national vaccination protocols","potential recombinant strain","sero","HPD","time","total","Mass"],"language":"en"},

Although effective, its efficacy is not absolute, the viral circulation is not prevented and some side effects cannot be denied. Despite this, the determinants of IBV epidemiology and the factors affecting its circulation are still largely unknown and poorly investigated. In the present study, 361 IBV QX (the most relevant field genotype in Italy) sequences were obtained between 2012 and 2016 from the two main Italian integrated poultry companies. Several biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches were used to reconstruct the history of the QX genotype in Italy and to assess the effect of different environmental, climatic and social factors on its spreading patterns. Moreover, two structured coalescent models were considered in order to investigate if an actual compartmentalization occurs between the two integrated poultry companies and the role of a third \u201Cghost\u201D deme, representative of minor industrial poultry companies and the rural sector. The obtained results suggest that the integration of the poultry companies is an effective barrier against IBV spreading, since the strains sampled from the two companies formed two essentially-independent clades. Remarkably, the only exceptions were represented by farms located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. The inclusion of a third deme in the model revealed the likely role of other poultry companies and rural farms (particularly concentrated in Northern Italy) as sources of strain introduction into one of the major poultry companies, whose farms are mainly located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. Accordingly, when the effect of different environmental and urban parameters on IBV geographic spreading was investigated, no factor seems to contribute to IBV dispersal velocity, being poultry population density the only exception.

Overall, the present study results stress the crucial relevance of human action rather than environmental factors, highlighting the direct benefits that could derive from improved management and organization of the poultry sector on a larger scale.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franzo, Giovanni; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Moreno, Ana; Legnardi, Matteo; Massi, Paola; Tosi, Giovanni; Trogu, Tiziana; Ceruti, Raffaella; Pesente, Patrizia; Ortali, Giovanni; Gavazzi, Luigi; Cecchinato, Mattia","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/827d52d21388fc55b478e17041603b9897b32ee7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190837.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64477-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350378/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","QX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["major poultry companies","poultry sector","IBV QX","populated poultry area of Northern Italy","main Italian integrated poultry companies","poultry population density","representative of minor industrial poultry companies","IBV geographic spreading","determinants of IBV epidemiology","environmental factors","IBV dispersal velocity","effect of different environmental","rural farms","pivotal role of management","social factors","likely role","rural sector","QX genotype","different viral population pattern","deme","present study results","spreading patterns","viral circulation","obtained results","control strategies","improved management","effective barrier","relevant field genotype","urban parameters","crucial relevance of human action","order","sources of strain introduction","direct benefits","time period","ghost","sequences","Infectious bronchitis virus","history","organization","integration","actual compartmentalization","structured coalescent models","efficacy","larger scale","wide vaccine administration","bioinformatics approaches","biostatistical","independent clades","strains","inclusion","exceptions","effects"],"language":"en"},

A key factor in a robust public health system is its workforce. As part of a nationally funded study of public health renewal in Canada, a policy analysis was conducted to compare public health human resources-relevant documents in two Canadian provinces, British Columbia (BC) and Ontario (ON), as they each implement public health renewal activities. METHODS: A content analysis of policy and planning documents from government and public health-related organizations was conducted by a research team comprised of academics and government decision-makers. Documents published between 2003 and 2011 were accessed (BC = 27; ON = 20); documents were either publicly available or internal to government and excerpted with permission. Documentary texts were deductively coded using a coding template developed by the researchers based on key health human resources concepts derived from two national policy documents. RESULTS: Documents in both provinces highlighted the importance of public health human resources planning and policies; this was particularly evident in early post-SARS documents. Key thematic areas of public health human resources identified were: education, training, and competencies; capacity; supply; intersectoral collaboration; leadership; public health planning context; and priority populations. Policy documents in both provinces discussed the importance of an educated, competent public health workforce with the appropriate skills and competencies for the effective and efficient delivery of public health services. CONCLUSION: This policy analysis identified progressive work on public health human resources policy and planning with early documents providing an inventory of issues to be addressed and later documents providing evidence of beginning policy development and implementation. While many similarities exist between the provinces, the context distinctive to each province has influenced and shaped how they have focused their public health human resources policies.","publish_time":"2014-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Regan, Sandra; MacDonald, Marjorie; Allan, Diane E; Martin, Cheryl; Peroff-Johnston, Nancy","journal":"Hum Resour Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2895e9bc46487b11d2e514ed42fca059df5ec7a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3936858.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-4491-12-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564931/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["public health systems","public health human resources policy","public health planning context","public health human resources-relevant documents","importance of public health human resources","public health human resources policies","competent public health workforce","robust public health system","public health renewal activities","public health-related organizations","planning documents","funded study of public health renewal","Key thematic areas of public health human resources","efficient delivery of public health services","key health human resources concepts","national policy documents","early documents","later documents","policy analysis","changing population health needs","policy development","content analysis of policy","early post-SARS documents","Canadian provinces","competencies","capacity","key factor","BC","government decision-makers","context distinctive","progressive work","intersectoral collaboration","leadership","appropriate skills","governments","researchers","Canada","British Columbia","academics","research team","supply","evidence","education","inventory of issues","priority populations","terrorism","training","Ontario","implementation","concerns","METHODS","CONCLUSION","coding template","pandemics","BACKGROUND","permission","RESULTS","Documentary texts","similarities"],"language":"en"},

This study was undertaken during the height of the Australian pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak to measure self-reported willingness to comply with physician recommendations to stay home for seven days, and to compare responses for the current strain of pandemic influenza, avian influenza, seasonal influenza, and the common cold. METHODS: Data were collected as part of the Queensland Social Survey (QSS) 2009, which consisted of a standardized introduction, 37 demographic questions, and research questions incorporated through a cost-sharing arrangement. Four questions related to respondents\u0027 anticipated compliance with a physician\u0027s advice to stay home if they had a common cold, seasonal influenza, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza or avian influenza were incorporated into QSS 2009, with responses recorded using a balanced Likert scale ranging from \u0022very unlikely\u0022 to \u0022very likely.\u0022 Discordance between responses for different diseases was analysed using McNemar\u0027s test. Associations between demographic variables and anticipated compliance were analysed using Pearson\u0027s chi-square or chi-square for linear-by-linear association, and confirmed using multivariate logistic regression; p \u003C 0.05 was used to establish statistical significance. RESULTS: Self-reported anticipated compliance increased from 59.9% for the common cold to 71.3% for seasonal influenza (p \u003C .001), and to 95.0% for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza and 94.7% for avian influenza (p \u003C 0.001 for both versus seasonal influenza). Anticipated compliance did not differ for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and avian influenza (p = 0.815). Age and sex were both associated with anticipated compliance in the setting of seasonal influenza and the common cold. Notably, 27.1% of health and community service workers would not comply with physician advice to stay home for seasonal influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Ninety-five percent of people report they would comply with a physicians\u0027 advice to stay home for seven days if they are diagnosed with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 or avian influenza, but only 71% can be expected to comply in the setting of seasonal influenza and fewer still can be expected to comply if they are diagnosed with a common cold. Sub-populations that might be worthwhile targets for public health messages aimed at increasing the rate of self-imposed isolation for seasonal influenza include males, younger people, and healthcare workers.","publish_time":"2010-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brown, Lawrence H; Aitken, Peter; Leggat, Peter A; Speare, Richard","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/846f108dcf44ed854491112e1de0c86b5193cb86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2847980.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20233450/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-138","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Queensland Social Survey"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["avian influenza","setting of seasonal influenza","current strain of pandemic influenza","H1N1","Australian pandemic","respondents\u0027 anticipated compliance","Self-reported anticipated compliance","physician advice","responses","physician recommendations","demographic questions","public health officials","public health messages","research questions","physician\u0027s advice","QSS","physicians\u0027 advice","days","self-reported willingness","younger people","Pearson\u0027s chi-square","linear association","demographic variables","healthcare workers","percent of people","rate of self-imposed isolation","isolation of infected individuals","community service workers","males","worthwhile targets","outbreak","different diseases","strategy available","multivariate logistic regression","height","Associations","RESULTS","balanced Likert scale","McNemar\u0027s test","Sub-populations","Queensland Social Survey","BACKGROUND","cost","Discordance","standardized introduction","sex","fewer","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","Data","statistical significance","arrangement","study"],"language":"en"},

(Family: Saururaceae) is an herbaceous perennial plant that grows in moist and shady places. The plant is well known among the people of diverse cultures across Japan, Korea, China and North-East India for its medicinal properties. Traditionally the plant is used for its various beneficial properties against inflammation, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, muscular sprain, stomach ulcer etc. Oxidative stress and inflammation were found to be linked with most of the diseases in recent times. Many ancient texts from Chinese Traditional Medicine, Ayurveda and Siddha, and Japanese Traditional medicine have documented the efficacy of H. cordata against oxidative stress and inflammation. Aim of the study This review aims to provide up-to-date and comprehensive information on the efficacy of H. cordata extracts as well as its bioactive compounds both in vitro and in vivo, against oxidative stress and inflammation Materials and methods Relevant information on H. cordata against oxidative stress and inflammation were collected from the established scientific databases such as NCBI, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Elsevier, and Springer. Additionally, a few books and magazines were also consulted to get the important information. Results Herbal medicines or plant products were traditionally being used for treating the oxidative stress and inflammation related diseases in diverse communities across the world. Scientifically, H. cordata has shown to target several signaling pathways and found to effectively reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation. Phyto-constituents such as afzelin, hyperoside and quercitrin have shown to reduce inflammation both in vitro and in vivo models. These molecules were also shown to have strong antioxidant properties both in vivo and in vitro models. Conclusions H. cordata extracts and its bioactive molecules were shown to have both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. As both in vitro and in vivo studies were shown that H. cordata did not have any toxicity on the various model systems used, future clinical studies will hopefully make an impact on the future direction of treating inflammation-related diseases.","publish_time":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shingnaisui, Khanchuila; Dey, Tapan; Manna, Prasenjit; Kalita, Jatin","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9f49e2685338d697a7405e7ad6424385fd129b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127360.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29605674/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874117334864; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874117334864; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.03.038","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Springer"],"organizations":["NCBI"],"locations":["Korea","China"],"keyphrases":["Oxidative stress","inflammation Materials","inflammation related diseases","inflammation-related diseases","cordata extracts","anti-oxidative properties","medicinal properties","plant products","various beneficial properties","efficacy of","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Houttuynia cordata Thunb","comprehensive information","herbaceous perennial plant","strong antioxidant properties","important information","bioactive molecules","models","Chinese Traditional Medicine","Japanese Traditional medicine","methods Relevant information","future clinical studies","diverse communities","future direction","bioactive compounds","various model systems","people of diverse cultures","muscular sprain","pneumonia","severe acute respiratory syndrome","stomach ulcer","Ayurveda","Siddha","NCBI","China","Korea","North-East India","ScienceDirect","Web of Science","ancient texts","established scientific databases","afzelin","Elsevier","Saururaceae","impact","toxicity","hyperoside","review","Herbal medicines","world","quercitrin","Conclusions","Phyto-constituents","shady places","study","Springer","Family","recent times","books","magazines","pathways"],"language":"en"},

Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30 suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Shen; Shen, Runnan; He, Jingdong; Li, Xinhao; Guo, Xushun","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e94f9379fd74fcacc4f3a57e03cbe9035efee8e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f62a607e8be261f7e05f93877fca05587ddc99b2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.31.929695","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLVP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapeutic effect of ritonavir","inhibitory effect of darunavir","lopinavir","coronavirus endopeptidase C30","significant conformation changes of CEP","potential therapeutic effect","slight conformation changes of PLVP","coronavirus disease","SARS-CoV","COVID","structure models","viral protease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","protease-drug complexes","proteases","papain","stronger efficacy","anti-HIV drugs","energy minimization","study","simulations","homology modeling"],"language":"en"},

Severe disease is characterized by early secretion of proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines. This cytokine secretion persisted in patients with severe viral pneumonia and was directly associated with the degree of viral replication in the respiratory tract. Cytokines play important roles in the antiviral defense, but persistent hypercytokinemia may cause inflammatory tissue damage and participate in the genesis of the respiratory failure observed in these patients. An absence of pre-existing protective antibodies was the rule for both mild and severe cases. A role for pathogenic immunocomplexes has been proposed for this disease. Defective T cell responses characterize severe cases of infection caused by the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Immune alterations associated with accompanying conditions such as obesity, pregnancy or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may interfere with the normal development of the specific response to the virus. The role of host immunogenetic factors associated with disease severity is also discussed in this review.

The spike protein of MERS-CoV (MERS-S) facilitates viral entry into host cells, which depends on activation of MERS-S by cellular proteases. Proteolytic activation of MERS-S during viral uptake into target cells has been demonstrated. However, it is unclear whether MERS-S is also cleaved during S protein synthesis in infected cells and whether cleavage is required for MERS-CoV infectivity. Here, we show that MERS-S is processed by proprotein convertases in MERS-S\u2013transfected and MERS-CoV\u2013infected cells and that several RXXR motifs located at the border between the surface and transmembrane subunit of MERS-S are required for efficient proteolysis. However, blockade of proprotein convertases did not impact MERS-S\u2013dependent transduction of target cells expressing high amounts of the viral receptor, DPP4, and did not modulate MERS-CoV infectivity. These results show that MERS-S is a substrate for proprotein convertases and demonstrate that processing by these enzymes is dispensable for S protein activation. Efforts to inhibit MERS-CoV infection by targeting host cell proteases should therefore focus on enzymes that process MERS-S during viral uptake into target cells.","publish_time":"2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gierer, Stefanie; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Heurich, Adeline; Ritz, Daniel; Springstein, Benjamin L.; Karsten, Christina B.; Schendzielorz, Alexander; Gnir\u00DF, Kerstin; Drosten, Christian; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ee95465ec6ed679756bab631f8847b5e0cc92ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107327.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiu407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25057042/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-S","MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV infectivity","spike protein of MERS","Proteolytic activation of MERS","S protein activation","transmembrane subunit of MERS","S protein synthesis","infected cells","host cells","viral uptake","dependent transduction of target cells","viral entry","viral receptor","blockade of proprotein convertases","enzymes","host cell proteases","high amounts","cellular proteases","high case-fatality rate","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","border","cleavage","potential pandemic","surface","RXXR motifs","processing","DPP4","substrate","public health concern","Efforts","efficient proteolysis","results"],"language":"en"},

Methods Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled during the course of routine prenatal care visits when they were asymptomatic within the preceding two weeks (healthy controls) or when they reported symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) of \u22647 days of duration (cases). Clinical outcomes were assessed at enrollment and two weeks after. Re-enrollment was allowed. Nasal-pharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory pathogens by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sera were tested for RSV-specific antibody responses by Western Blot, microneutralization assay, and palivizumab competitive antibody assay. Results During the 2015\u20132016 respiratory virus season, 7 of 65 (11%) pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment and 8 of 77 (10%) pregnant women with ARI during the study period (initial or re-enrollment) had PCR-confirmed RSV infection. Four (50%) PCR-confirmed RSV ARI cases reported symptoms of a lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), one was hospitalized.

We describe the sputum inflammatory phenotype during asthma exacerbation and correlate it with severity and treatment response. METHODS: Patients presenting to hospital with an asthma exacerbation were recruited during a 12\u2010month period and followed up after 4 weeks. Induced sputum was collected at both visits. Patients underwent spirometry, arterial blood gas analysis, fractional exhaled nitric oxide analysis, white blood cell counts and a screening for common respiratory viruses and bacteria. An eosinophilic exacerbation (EE) was defined as having sputum eosinophils \u2265 3% and a non\u2010eosinophilic exacerbation as \u003C 3% (NEE). RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were enrolled; 37 (79%) had successful sputum induction at baseline, of whom 43% had sputum eosinophils \u22653% (EE). Patients with EE had a significantly lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) % predicted (70.8%, P = 0.03) than patients with NEE (83.6%). Furthermore, EE patients were more likely to require supplemental oxygen during admission (63% vs 14%, P = 0.002). The prevalence of respiratory viruses was the same in EE and NEE patients (44% vs 52%, P = 0.60), as was bacterial infection (6% vs 14%, P = 0.44). Fractional expiratory nitric oxide (FeNO) correlated with sputum %\u2010eosinophils (\u03C1 = 0.57, P \u003C 0.001), and predicted airway eosinophilia with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 70%.

To understand the transmission dynamics and potential impact of an outbreak, several types of data are necessary. Here we build on experience gained in the West African Ebola epidemic and prior emerging infectious disease outbreaks to set out a checklist of data needed to: (1) quantify severity and transmissibility; (2) characterize heterogeneities in transmission and their determinants; and (3) assess the effectiveness of different interventions. We differentiate data needs into individual-level data (e.g. a detailed list of reported cases), exposure data (e.g. identifying where/how cases may have been infected) and population-level data (e.g. size/demographics of the population(s) affected and when/where interventions were implemented). A remarkable amount of individual-level and exposure data was collected during the West African Ebola epidemic, which allowed the assessment of (1) and (2). However, gaps in population-level data (particularly around which interventions were applied when and where) posed challenges to the assessment of (3). Here we highlight recurrent data issues, give practical suggestions for addressing these issues and discuss priorities for improvements in data collection in future outbreaks.

MERS has been endemic to Saudi Arabia since 2012. The reservoir of MERS-CoV is the dromedary camel, suggesting that MERS is primarily a zoonotic disease. MERS-CoV is common in dromedaries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa as evidenced by neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV; however, human cases have remained limited to the Middle East. To better understand the cause of this difference, the virological properties of African camel MERS-CoV were analyzed based on the spike (S) protein in Ethiopia. Nasal swabs were collected from 258 young dromedaries (\u2264 2 years old) in the Afar region of Ethiopia, of which 39 were positive for MERS-CoV, as confirmed by genetic tests. All positive tests were exclusive to the Amibara woreda region. Using next-generation sequencing, two full-length genomes of Amibara isolates were successfully decoded; both isolates belonged to the C2 clade based on phylogenetic analysis of full-length and S protein sequences. Recombinant EMC isolates of MERS-CoV, in which the S protein is replaced with those of Amibara isolates, were then generated to test the roles of these proteins in viral properties. Amibara S recombinants replicated more slowly in cultured cells than in EMC S recombinants. In neutralizing assays, Amibara S recombinants were neutralized by lower concentrations of sera from both Ethiopian dromedaries and EMC isolate (wild-type)-immunized mouse sera, relative to the EMC S recombinants, indicating that viruses coated in the Amibara S protein were easier to neutralize than the EMC S protein. Neutralization experiments performed using S1/S2 chimeric recombinants of the EMC and Amibara S proteins showed that the neutralization profile was dependent on the S1 region of the S protein. These results suggest that the slower viral replication and the ease of neutralization seen in the Ethiopian MERS-CoV are due to strain-specific differences in the S protein and may account for the absence of human MERS-CoV cases in Ethiopia.","publish_time":"2019-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shirato, Kazuya; Melaku, Simenew Keskes; Kawachi, Kengo; Nao, Naganori; Iwata-Yoshikawa, Naoko; Kawase, Miyuki; Kamitani, Wataru; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Tessema, Tesfaye Sisay; Sentsui, Hiroshi","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7f090aebd3ca0c64361662b87a6134c0afacb1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6593072.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275264/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","EMC S","EMC"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","North Africa","East Africa","Ethiopia"],"keyphrases":["EMC S protein","Ethiopian MERS-CoV","Amibara S recombinants","EMC S recombinants","MERS coronavirus","Amibara S proteins","reservoir of MERS","S protein sequences","Recombinant EMC isolates of MERS","absence of human MERS-CoV cases","virological properties of African camel MERS-CoV","Amibara woreda region","full-length genomes of Amibara isolates","East Africa","region of Ethiopia","Ethiopian dromedaries","S1 region","Middle East respiratory syndrome","S2 chimeric recombinants","young dromedaries","neutralization profile","ease of neutralization","Neutralization experiments","human cases","viral properties","positive tests","emerging respiratory disease","North Africa","dromedary camel","zoonotic disease","genetic tests","neutralizing assays","phylogenetic analysis of full-length","lower concentrations of sera","immunized mouse sera","slower viral replication","wild-type","viruses","cultured cells","C2 clade","strain-specific differences","years old","antibodies","spike","generation sequencing","results","roles","Saudi Arabia","Nasal swabs","cause"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, a rapid, sensitive, and specific serologic test for detecting anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in both humans and animals is urgently needed for the successful management of this illness. Here, we evaluated various novel luciferase immunosorbent assays (LISA) based on nucleocapsid protein (NP) as well as fragments derived from spike protein (S) including subunit 1 (S1), N terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD) and subunit 2 (S2) of S for the detection of MERS-CoV-specific IgG. Fusion proteins, including nanoluciferase (NLuc) and various fragments derived from the NP or S protein of MERS-CoV, were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells. LISAs that detected anti-MERS-CoV IgG were further developed using cell lysates expressing various fusion proteins. Panels of human or animal samples infected with MERS-CoV were used to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of various LISAs in reference to a MERS-CoV RT-PCR, commercial S1-based ELISA, and pseudovirus particle neutralization test (ppNT). Our results showed that the S1-, RBD-, and NP-LISAs were more sensitive than the NTD- and S2-LISAs for the detection of anti-MERS-CoV IgG. Furthermore, the S1-, RBD-, and NP-LISAs were more sensitive (by at least 16-fold) than the commercially available S1-ELISA. Moreover, the S1-, RBD-, and NP-LISA specifically recognized anti-MERS-CoV IgG and did not cross-react with samples derived from other human CoV (OC43, 229E, HKU1, NL63)-infected patients. More importantly, these LISAs proved their applicability and reliability for detecting anti-MERS-CoV IgG in samples from camels, monkeys, and mice, among which the RBD-LISA exhibited excellent performance. The results of this study suggest that the novel MERS-CoV RBD- and S1- LISAs are highly effective platforms for the rapid and sensitive detection of anti-MERS-CoV IgG in human and animal samples. These assays have the potential to be used as serologic tests for the management and control of MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Wenling; Wang, Tianyu; Deng, Yao; Niu, Peihua; A, Ruhan; Zhao, Jincun; Peiris, Malik; Tang, Shixing; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"Biosafety and Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590053619300503; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053619300503","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","NP"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["novel MERS-CoV RBD","detection of MERS","anti-MERS-CoV antibodies","human CoV","control of MERS","MERS coronavirus","sensitive detection of anti-MERS-CoV IgG","MERS-CoV RT-PCR","CoV infection","CoV-specific IgG","S protein of MERS","S1- LISAs","NP-LISAs","RBD-LISA","S2-LISAs","specificity of various LISAs","available S1-ELISA","various fragments","animal samples","commercial S1-based ELISA","various fusion proteins","Panels of human","specific serologic test","NTD","subunit","human embryonic kidney","various novel luciferase immunosorbent assays","spike protein","nucleocapsid protein","results","serologic tests","successful management","infected patients","receptor-binding domain","N terminal domain","pseudovirus particle neutralization test","reference","cell lysates","effective platforms","HKU1","nanoluciferase","NLuc","camels","lethal zoonosis","reliability","Middle East respiratory syndrome","NL63","ppNT","T cells","significant threat","animals","monkeys","OC43","humans","sensitivity","applicability","public health","potential","mice","excellent performance","fold","study","illness"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the Large Eddy Simulation was utilized to predict the effects of thermal plume of different intensities on particle diffusion. Three postures of the human body model and three room temperatures were considered. The results show that the convective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of the human body varies greatly with different postures. The coefficient is the largest when the model is in sitting posture, leading to the greatest heat transfer rate. Meanwhile, the thermal plume generated by bending the thigh increases the size of the facial thermal plume in horizon direction. The increase of the difference between indoor temperature and skin temperature causes an increase of the convective heat transfer of the manikin, leading to stronger airflow in front of the face. The thicker and faster the human thermal plume is, the more difficult it is penetrated by aerosols produced by nasal breathing, finally resulting in most particles distributed within 0.2 m thick under the roof.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Guohui; Bi, Yang; Zhang, Yixian; Cai, Yilin; Huang, Kailiang","journal":"Sustainable Cities and Society","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae3256f2d725437f39cca2fe5314ced969417961.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288992/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670719316385; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101935; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670719316385","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["facial thermal plume","Abstract Predicting influence of human thermal plume","effects of thermal plume of different intensities","human body model","convective heat transfer coefficient","indoor temperature","increase","greatest heat transfer rate","different postures","particles","skin temperature","diffusion of respiration","particle diffusion","indoor air quality","surface","important issue","manikin","difference","infectious microbes","room temperatures","thigh","size","horizon direction","Large Eddy Simulation","aerosols","study","stronger airflow","results","nasal breathing","roof"],"language":"en"},

Screening anti-ZIKV drugs derived from Chinese medicinal herbs is one method of identifying antiviral agents. In this paper, we report that (1) Cephalotaxine (CET), an alkaloid isolated from Cephalotaxus drupacea, was effective in inhibiting ZIKV activity in vitro (i.e., in Vero and A549 cell lines) and (2) the mechanisms which underlie these effects involve virucidal activity and a decrease in viral replication. Specifically, CET was found to decrease ZIKV RNA and viral protein expression, inhibit ZIKV replication, and inhibit ZIKV mRNA/protein production. We also determined that CET is effective in inhibiting dengue virus 1\u20134 (DENV1-4). Taken together, our findings indicate that CET could be an effective lead compound in the treatment of ZIKV and also suggest that further investigation and development of CET-derived drugs may lead to a new class of anti-Flavivirus medications.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Zheng-Zong; Ho, Yi-Jung; Lu, Jeng-Wei","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00e7af2188897d57226ae59ebf7874882ff928a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092853.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X19323320; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X19323320; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31818462/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CET","ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV replication","ZIKV RNA","ZIKV mRNA","treatment of ZIKV","inhibiting ZIKV activity","Screening anti-ZIKV drugs","development of CET","viral replication","derived drugs","effective lead compound","decrease","viral protein expression","inhibiting dengue virus","virucidal activity","protein production","Zika virus","new class of anti-Flavivirus medications","asymptomatic infections","Chinese medicinal herbs","severe neurological disorders","method","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","Cephalotaxus drupacea","serious public health problem","world","Syndromes of infected people","Vero","effects","alkaloid","investigation","A549 cell lines","microcephaly","mosquito","antiviral agents","mechanisms","DENV1","Cephalotaxine","findings","paper"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether monitoring cytokine production could contribute to the better management of pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection. SETTING: Clinical Immunology Laboratory and Pediatrics Department, University Hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Ten Asian and 2 Eurasian children infected with HIV-1 by mother-to-child transmission were followed for up to 5 years while on treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of unstimulated and mitogen-activated cytokine-secreting cells (IFN-gamma, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha) were measured by ELISPOT assay at frequent intervals, and correlations were sought with CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B cell counts and viral loads. RESULTS: Mitogen-stimulated IL-2-secreting cells were directly associated with recovery of CD4\u002B cells. Correlations with viral load were found for Con A-induced IFN-gamma, Con A-induced IL-4, and unstimulated IL-10, suggesting that these cytokines were either suppressed by high virus levels or that higher cytokine levels suppressed virus. IFN-gamma, IL-2-, IL-4-, and IL-12-secreting cells induced by PHA, Con A, and/or SAC tended to increase for the first 3-4 years of treatment but declined thereafter. CONCLUSION: Alterations in cytokine profiles were not associated with adverse clinical events and there was little evidence to indicate that monitoring cytokine enzyme-linked immunospots (ELISPOTs) could contribute to pediatric patient management.","publish_time":"2005-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Brian M; Chiu, Susan SS; Wong, Wilfred HS; Lim, Wilina WL; Lau, Yu-lung","journal":"J Int AIDS Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f2eacde02bfd34993a2eab9d87c2643fcfd17e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2759641.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-2652-7-2-71; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19825129/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Clinical Immunology Laboratory","Pediatrics Department","PHA","SAC"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["induced IL","unstimulated IL","Mitogen-stimulated IL","cytokine profiles","monitoring cytokine production","mitogen-activated cytokine-secreting cells","higher cytokine levels","HIV","induced IFN-gamma","longitudinal studies of cytokine production","monitoring cytokine enzyme-linked immunospots","correlations","infection","years of treatment","better management of pediatric patients","high virus levels","pediatric patient management","Numbers of unstimulated","Eurasian children","recovery of CD4","viral loads","Chinese children","Clinical Immunology Laboratory","adverse clinical events","Pediatrics Department","University Hospital","ELISPOTs","little evidence","Hong Kong","ELISPOT assay","active antiretroviral therapy","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","frequent intervals","SETTING","CD8","interleukin","HAART","mother","CONCLUSION","Alterations","RESULTS","TNF-alpha","child transmission","cytokines","OBJECTIVE","CONTEXT","SAC"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we have developed a novel quantitative temporal in vivo proteomics (QTiPs) platform to capture proteomic signatures of temporally transitioning virus-driven myeloid cells directly in situ, thus taking into consideration host\u2013virus interactions throughout the course of an infection. QTiPs, in combination with phenotypic, functional, and metabolic analyses, elucidated a pivotal role for inflammatory CD11b(\u002B), Ly6G(\u2013), Ly6C(high-low) cells in antiviral immune response and viral clearance. Most importantly, the time-resolved QTiPs data set showed the transition of CD11b(\u002B), Ly6G(\u2013), Ly6C(high-low) cells into M2-like macrophages, which displayed increased antigen-presentation capacities and bioenergetic demands late in infection. We elucidated the pivotal role of myeloid cells in virus clearance and show how these cells phenotypically, functionally, and metabolically undergo a timely transition from inflammatory to M2-like macrophages in vivo. With respect to the growing appreciation for in vivo examination of viral\u2013host interactions and for the role of myeloid cells, this study elucidates the use of quantitative proteomics to reveal the role and response of distinct immune cell populations throughout the course of virus infection.","publish_time":"2017-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clements, Derek R.; Murphy, John Patrick; Sterea, Andra; Kennedy, Barry E.; Kim, Youra; Helson, Erin; Almasi, Shekoufeh; Holay, Namit; Konda, Prathyusha; Paulo, Joao A.; Sharif, Tanveer; Lee, Patrick W.; Weekes, Michael P.; Gygi, Steven P.; Gujar, Shashi","journal":"J Proteome Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/685eba5fefce2d8dff007fa996ecf065e56da933.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5648240.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28768414/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pivotal role of myeloid cells","course of virus infection","central role","virus interactions","virus clearance","transitioning virus","viral clearance","examination of viral","host interactions","inflammatory CD11b","M2","Ly6C","high-low","transition of CD11b","study","macrophages","Ly6G","antiviral immune response","QTiPs data set","context of viral eradication","use of quantitative proteomics","course of acute infections","consideration host","timely transition","response of distinct immune cell populations","bioenergetic","increased antigen-presentation capacities","platform","metabolic analyses","proteomic signatures","growing appreciation","situ","combination","Image","respect"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, two sea cucumber species, Holothuria leucospilota and Stichopus vastus, were collected from Lampung (Indonesia), and 127 bacterial strains were identified by partial 16S rRNA-gene sequencing analysis and compared with the NCBI database. In addition, the overall bacterial diversity from tissue samples of the sea cucumbers H. leucospilota and S. vastus was analyzed using the cultivation-independent Illumina MiSEQ analysis. Selected bacterial isolates were grown to high densities and the extracted biomass was tested against a selection of bacteria and fungi as well as the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Identification of putative bioactive bacterial-derived compounds were performed by analyzing the accurate mass of the precursor/parent ions (MS(1)) as well as product/daughter ions (MS(2)) using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis of all active fractions. With this attempt we were able to identify 23 putatively known and two previously unidentified precursor ions. Moreover, through 16S rRNA-gene sequencing we were able to identify putatively novel bacterial species from the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and also Firmicutes. Our findings suggest that sea cucumbers like H. leucospilota and S. vastus are promising sources for the isolation of novel bacterial species that produce compounds with potentially high biotechnological potential.","publish_time":"2019-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wibowo, Joko T.; Kellermann, Matthias Y.; Versluis, Dennis; Putra, Masteria Y.; Murniasih, Tutik; Mohr, Kathrin I.; Wink, Joachim; Engelmann, Michael; Praditya, Dimas F.; Steinmann, Eike; Schupp, Peter J.","journal":"Mar Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e912d2c58583bb9540a560d237fca233aefde70.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cf997a9d856f8c044b352dad4b62e6718fbe93d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6891442.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31717405/; https://doi.org/10.3390/md17110635","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Stichopus"],"organizations":["NCBI"],"locations":["Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["bacterial strains","bacterial isolates","isolation of novel bacterial species","overall bacterial diversity","sea cucumbers","sea cucumber species","S rRNA-gene sequencing analysis","Identification of putative bioactive bacterial-derived compounds","Holothuria leucospilota","anti-infective compounds","Stichopus vastus","high densities","parent ions","daughter ions","unidentified precursor ions","high resolution mass spectrometry","high biotechnological potential","marine invertebrates","accurate mass","selection of bacteria","associated bacteria","cultivation-independent Illumina MiSEQ analysis","untapped marine environments","HRMS","tissue samples","phyla Actinobacteria","promising sources","screening approach","fungi","re-discovery","extracted biomass","Proteobacteria","hepatitis C virus","HCV","Firmicutes","Lampung","active fractions","Indonesia","addition","product","NCBI database","order","findings","attempt"],"language":"en"},

Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020. Findings Of the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43\u201363), and 20 (58\u00B78%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [91\u00B72%]), fatigue (25 [73\u00B75%]) and dry cough (18 [52\u00B79%]). 15 (44\u00B71%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20\u00B75%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury. Interpretation In this retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 15 (44\u00B71%) patients needed ICU care, and the mortality rate was 20\u00B75%.

Although previously thought to mediate protection solely in the extracellular environment, recent research has revealed that antibody-mediated protection extends to the cytosolic compartment of cells. This postentry viral defense mechanism requires binding of the antibody to a cytosolic Fc receptor named tripartite motif containing 21 (TRIM21). In contrast to other Fc receptors, TRIM21 shows remarkably broad isotype specificity as it does not only bind IgG but also IgM and IgA. When viral pathogens coated with these antibody isotypes enter the cytosol, TRIM21 is rapidly recruited and efficient neutralization occurs before the virus has had the time to replicate. In addition, inflammatory signaling is induced. As such, TRIM21 acts as a cytosolic sensor that engages antibodies that have failed to protect against infection in the extracellular environment. Here, we summarize our current understanding of how TRIM21 orchestrates humoral immunity in the cytosolic environment.","publish_time":"2015-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foss, Stian; Watkinson, Ruth; Sandlie, Inger; James, Leo C; Andersen, Jan Terje","journal":"Immunol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8b7b5e4c3daa4fc5444223319456deecad9acfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4670481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26497531/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12363","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytosolic environment","TRIM21 acts","cytosolic sensor","extracellular environment","cytosolic Fc receptor","antibody isotypes","antibody-mediated protection","cytosolic compartment of cells","Antibodies","Fc receptors","viral pathogens","postentry viral defense mechanism","binding","humoral immunity","tripartite motif","recent research","key molecules","fight","broad isotype specificity","current understanding","virus","infections","efficient neutralization","contrast","IgG","IgM","IgA","addition","time"],"language":"en"},

For instance, complex networks based on Graph theory are used to represent the structure and/or dynamics of different large biological systems such as protein\u2013protein interaction networks. In addition, Randic, Liao, Nandy, Basak, and many others developed some special types of graph-based representations. This special type of graph includes geometrical constrains to node positioning in space and adopts final geometrical shapes that resemble lattice-like patterns. Lattice networks have been used to visually depict DNA and protein sequences but they are very flexible. However, despite the proved efficacy of new lattice-like graph/networks to represent diverse systems, most works focus on only one specific type of biological data. This work proposes a generalized type of lattice and illustrates how to use it in order to represent and compare biological data from different sources. We exemplify the following cases: protein sequence; mass spectra (MS) of protein peptide mass fingerprints (PMF); molecular dynamic trajectory (MDTs) from structural studies; mRNA microarray data; single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); 1D or 2D-Electrophoresis study of protein polymorphisms and protein-research patent and/or copyright information.

The sequence diversity of an RNA virus population contributes to its ability to infect the host. This diversity emanates from errors made by the RdRp during RNA synthesis. The physical basis for RdRp fidelity is unclear but is linked to conformational changes occurring during the nucleotide-addition cycle. To understand RdRp dynamics that might influence RdRp function, we have analyzed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the nanosecond timescale of four RdRps from the picornavirus family that exhibit 30\u201374% sequence identity. Principal component analysis showed that the major motions observed during the simulations derived from conserved structural motifs and regions of known function. Dynamics of residues participating in the same biochemical property, for example RNA binding, nucleotide binding or catalysis, were correlated even when spatially distant on the RdRp structure. The conserved and correlated dynamics of functional, structural elements suggest co-evolution of dynamics with structure and function of the RdRp. Crystal structures of all picornavirus RdRps exhibit a template-nascent RNA duplex channel too small to fully accommodate duplex RNA. Simulations revealed opening and closing motions of the RNA and NTP channels, which might be relevant to NTP entry, PP(i) exit and translocation. A role for nanosecond timescale dynamics in RdRp fidelity is supported by altered dynamics of the high-fidelity G64S derivative of PV RdRp relative to wild-type enzyme.","publish_time":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moustafa, Ibrahim M.; Shen, Hujun; Morton, Brandon; Colina, Coray M.; Cameron, Craig E.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/592f534dcc98076fbf2db5eeb2644fd26d2b4cbd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0a4e8d55a3720073dec7af9194b25cf909593b30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3114172.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21575642/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283611005225; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3114172?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283611005225; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.078","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RdRp dynamics","RdRp function","RdRp fidelity","duplex RNA","RdRp structure","RNA viruses","RNA synthesis","viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","example RNA binding","altered dynamics","Dynamics of residues","RNA virus population","nanosecond timescale dynamics","correlated dynamics of functional","co-evolution of dynamics","simulations","template-nascent RNA duplex channel","all-atom molecular dynamics","high-fidelity G64S derivative of PV RdRp relative","nucleotide binding","picornavirus RdRps","sequence diversity","conserved structural motifs","regions of known function","structural elements","major motions","NTP channels","NTP entry","picornavirus family","sequence identity","nucleotide-addition cycle","MD","wild-type enzyme","biochemical property","PP","ability","physical basis","multiplication","catalysis","role","Principal component analysis","conformational changes","Crystal structures","errors","translocation","host"],"language":"en"},

Coronaviruses are being associated increasingly with severe diseases in the lower respiratory tract. Alveolar epithelial cells are an important target for coronavirus infection in the lung, and infected cells can initiate innate immune responses to viral infection. In this overview, we describe in vitro models of highly differentiated alveolar epithelial cells that are currently being used to study the innate immune response to coronavirus infection. We have shown that rat coronavirus infection of rat alveolar type I epithelial cells in vitro induces expression of CXC chemokines, which may recruit and activate neutrophils. Although neutrophils are recruited early in infection in several coronavirus models including rat coronavirus. However, their role in viral clearance and/or immune-mediated tissue damage is not understood. Primary cultures of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells will be useful for identifying the interactions between coronaviruses and alveolar epithelial cells that influence the innate immune responses to infection in the lung. Understanding the molecular details of these interactions will be critical for the design of effective strategies to prevent and treat coronavirus infections in the lung.","publish_time":"2009-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miura, Tanya A.; Holmes, Kathryn V.","journal":"Journal of Leukocyte Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86e5e42fd7dd5a22750bfe193fd02b53d98ddd3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2774885.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1189/jlb.0209078; https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1189/jlb.0209078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19638499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CXC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rat coronavirus infection of rat alveolar type","viral infection","coronavirus models","lung","infected cells","coronavirus infections","Primary cultures of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells","innate immune responses","interactions","Coronaviruses","neutrophils","immune-mediated tissue damage","viral clearance","important target","mortality","significant cause of morbidity","severe diseases","design of effective strategies","lower respiratory tract","animals","expression of CXC chemokines","humans","molecular details","role","overview"],"language":"en"},

However, certain viruses have entered the human genome. Of the human genome, \u223C45% is composed of transposable elements (long interspersed nuclear elements [LINEs], short interspersed nuclear elements [SINEs] and transposons) and 5-8% is derived from viral sequences with similarity to infectious retroviruses. If integration of retrovirus occurs in a germline, the integrated viral sequences are heritable. Accumulation of viral sequences has created the current human genome. This article summarizes recent studies of retroviruses in humans and bridges clinical fields and evolutionary genetics. First, we report the repertories of human-infective retroviruses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed, and the relationship between them was analyzed. RESULTS: Totally, 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58 (73%) of the 80 patients had cough, and 61 (76%) of the 80 patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%), and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12 \u00B1 6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%), and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary inflammation index value was (34% \u00B1 20%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the pulmonary inflammation index value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset, and body temperature (P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The common chest CT findings of COVID-19 are multiple ground glass opacity, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura. There are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results. Computed tomography plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of this emerging global health emergency.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Jiong; Wu, Xiaojia; Zeng, Wenbing; Guo, Dajing; Fang, Zheng; Chen, Linli; Huang, Huizhe; Li, Chuanming","journal":"Invest Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76380a438d17f67cfa6f9760485ec9837cfcc1e1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c55fdbdf1ff3c8389836d1e2db7d120dcc6e646a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147284.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32091414/; https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000670","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","right lower lobe","left lower lobe","dorsal segment","posterior basal segment","lateral basal segment","common chest CT findings of COVID","chest CT images","clinical data","clinical manifestations","clinical features","average pulmonary inflammation index value","degree of pulmonary inflammation","chest computed tomography","multiple ground glass opacity","frequent CT abnormalities","main clinical symptoms","consolidation","interlobular septal thickening","common involved lung segments","cases","relationship","monocyte count","body temperature","Study sample","laboratory results","values of lymphocyte count","high temperature levels","evaluation","C-reactive protein","days","procalcitonin","illness onset","confirmed coronavirus disease","diagnosis","important role","emerging global health emergency","CONCLUSIONS","significant correlations","Correlation analysis","MATERIALS","METHODS","lungs","OBJECTIVES","aim","regards","lesions","cough","pleura"],"language":"en"},

Since the first report of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) outbreak, tremendous efforts to control this disease, including various national policies and plans incorporating the use of multiple modified live-virus vaccines, have been made. However, PRRSV is still a significant threat to the swine industry, and new variants continually emerge as a result of PRRSV evolution. Several studies have shown that pandemic PRRSV strains have enormous genetic diversity and that commercial vaccines can only provide partial protection against these strains. Therefore, effective anti-PRRSV drugs may be more suitable and reliable for PRRSV control. In this study, we observed that isobavachalcone (IBC), which was first isolated from Psoralea corylifolia, had potent anti-PRRSV activity in vitro. Although many biological activities of IBC have been reported, this is the first report describing the antiviral activity of IBC. Furthermore, after a systematic investigation, we demonstrated that IBC inhibits PRRSV replication at the post-entry stage of PRRSV infection. Thus, IBC may be a candidate for further evaluation as a therapeutic agent against PRRSV infection of swine in vivo.","publish_time":"2018-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hai-Ming; Liu, Tian-Xin; Wang, Tong-Yun; Wang, Gang; Liu, Yong-Gang; Liu, Si-Guo; Tang, Yan-Dong; Cai, Xue-Hui","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14241795a7c1b25b0db12f42473176d5af9a2eca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086980.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29411137/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3755-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","IBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV control","PRRSV replication","PRRSV infection of swine","pandemic PRRSV strains","result of PRRSV evolution","potent anti-PRRSV activity","effective anti-PRRSV drugs","post-entry stage of PRRSV infection","antiviral activity of IBC","swine industry","biological activities of IBC","respiratory syndrome virus","report","commercial vaccines","use of multiple modified live-virus vaccines","enormous genetic diversity","plans","Psoralea corylifolia","therapeutic agent","disease","outbreak","pathogen of great economic significance","various national policies","tremendous efforts","partial protection","new variants","evaluation","significant threat","candidate","studies","isobavachalcone","systematic investigation","study"],"language":"en"},

This study examined the long\u2010term outcome of pulmonary function, exercise capacity, health and work status among SARS survivors. Methods: A prospective cohort study of SARS patients at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong was conducted, with serial assessments of lung function, 6MWD and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after disease onset. The work status was also recorded. Results: Serial assessments were completed by 55 of the 123 (39.9%) subjects, of whom 27 were health\u2010care workers (HCW). The mean age of the group was 44.4 (SD 13.2) years and 19 (34.5%) were males. At 24 months, 10 (18.2%), 9 (16.4%), 6 (10.9%) and 29 (52.7%) subjects had FEV(1), FVC, TLC and DL(CO) \u003C 80% of predicted values, respectively. The mean (SD) 6MWD increased significantly from 439.0 (89.1) m at 3 months to 460.1 (102.8) m at 6 months (P 0.016) and became steady after 6 months.

Ubiquitination has multiple effects on viral propagation, including viral genome uncoating, viral replication, and immune evasion. Ubiquitination of viral proteins is triggered by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). This involves the covalent attachment of the highly conserved 76 amino acid residue ubiquitin protein to target proteins by the consecutive actions of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes, and the 26S proteasome that together form a multiprotein complex that degrades target proteins. The UPS is the primary cytosolic proteolytic machinery for the selective degradation of various forms of proteins including viral proteins, thereby limiting viral growth in host cells. To combat this host anti-viral machinery, viruses have evolved the ability to employ or subvert the UPS to inactivate or degrade cellular proteins to favour viral propagation.

Nanotechnology today provides hope as an alternative to antibiotics, in the field of antimicrobial therapy. The diverse structures and small size make the nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit unique and remarkable properties, drastically different from its bulk counterparts. Various microorganisms such as actinomycetes, algae, yeast, fungi, and bacteria synthesize inorganic nanoparticles enzymatically, either extracellularly or intracellularly. Various metallic NPs, for example, magnesium, titanium, copper, silver, and gold, are well reported for their antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. The antimicrobial properties of these NPs may be attributed to its ability to disorganize membrane structure, form pores in the bacterial cell wall, inhibit or disruption biofilm, etc. Most metal oxide nanoparticles like ZnO-NPs, exhibit bactericidal properties by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, other NPs like MgO-NPs are effective due to their peculiar physical structure. Nanoparticles can also be fabricated with various bioactive entities. Due to their small and controllable size, functionalized nanoparticles can deliver drugs precisely and safely to the target sites. Thus, microbial mediated production of nanoparticles is gaining substantial interest as a potential solution to the growing need for the development of eco-friendly ways to fight microbial resistance and control diseases.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Busi, Siddhardha; Rajkumari, Jobina","journal":"Nanoparticles in Pharmacotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1877e84c632c92040e538aae2f207c1d7b05c379.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150190.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128165041000089; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128165041000089","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZnO-NPs","MgO-NPs","functionalized nanoparticles","inorganic nanoparticles","antimicrobial properties","Various metallic NPs","metal oxide nanoparticles","bactericidal properties","microbial mediated production of nanoparticles","remarkable properties","antifungal properties","small size","Various microorganisms","field of antimicrobial therapy","various bioactive entities","microbial resistance","controllable size","membrane structure","development of eco-friendly ways","development of multidrug resistant","peculiar physical structure","form pores","bacterial cell wall","MDR","disruption biofilm","fungi","magnesium","example","alarming rate","growing need","copper","pathogens","actinomycetes","algae","reactive oxygen species","alternative","silver","potential solution","yeast","titanium","antibiotics","drugs","ability","great health concern","control diseases","diverse structures","hope","ROS","antiviral","bulk counterparts"],"language":"en"},

As a result, viruses may persist in host and develop chronic infections. Type I interferons (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) are among the most potent antiviral cytokines triggered by viral infections. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease of pigs that is characterized by negligible induction of type I IFNs and viral persistence for an extended period. For IFN production, RIG-I/MDA5 and JAK-STAT pathways are two major signaling pathways, and recent studies indicate that PRRS virus is armed to modulate type I IFN responses during infection. This review describes the viral strategies for modulation of type I IFN responses. At least three non\u2013structural proteins (Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp11) and a structural protein (N nucleocapsid protein) have been identified and characterized to play roles in the IFN suppression and NF-\u03BAB pathways. Nsp\u2019s are early proteins while N is a late protein, suggesting that additional signaling pathways may be involved in addition to the IFN pathway. The understanding of molecular bases for virus-mediated modulation of host innate immune signaling will help us design new generation vaccines and control PRRS.","publish_time":"2012-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Yan; Han, Mingyuan; Kim, Chiyong; Calvert, Jay G.; Yoo, Dongwan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4db01f9d02579bbc25384c6f72a5ce25a4dba0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3347317.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v4040424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22590680/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN responses","IFN suppression","IFN-\u03B1","IFN production","IFN pathway","modulation of type","viral infections","PRRS virus","viral persistence","viral strategies","virus-mediated modulation of host","late protein","control PRRS","JAK-STAT pathways","N nucleocapsid protein","NF-\u03BAB pathways","structural proteins","negligible induction of type","host immune surveillance","viruses","early proteins","chronic infections","Innate immunity","IFNs","major","MDA5","recent studies","respiratory syndrome","line of defense","understanding of molecular bases","new generation vaccines","potent antiviral cytokines","Nsp2","RIG","Nsp11","disease of pigs","extended period","Nsp\u2019s","interferons","roles","review","turn","addition","result"],"language":"en"},

We analysed epidemiological and genetic data to assess the extent of human infection, the performance of case detection, and the transmission potential of MERS-CoV with and without control measures. METHODS: We assembled a comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases from public sources and estimated the incubation period and generation time from case cluster data. Using data of numbers of visitors to the Middle East and their duration of stay, we estimated the number of symptomatic cases in the Middle East. We did independent analyses, looking at the growth in incident clusters, the growth in viral population, the reproduction number of cluster index cases, and cluster sizes to characterise the dynamical properties of the epidemic and the transmission scenario. FINDINGS: The estimated number of symptomatic cases up to Aug 8, 2013, is 940 (95% CI 290\u20132200), indicating that at least 62% of human symptomatic cases have not been detected. We find that the case-fatality ratio of primary cases detected via routine surveillance (74%; 95% CI 49\u201391) is biased upwards because of detection bias; the case-fatality ratio of secondary cases was 20% (7\u201342). Detection of milder cases (or clinical management) seemed to have improved in recent months. Analysis of human clusters indicated that chains of transmission were not self-sustaining when infection control was implemented, but that R in the absence of controls was in the range 0\u00B78\u20131\u00B73. Three independent data sources provide evidence that R cannot be much above 1, with an upper bound of 1\u00B72\u20131\u00B75. INTERPRETATION: By showing that a slowly growing epidemic is underway either in human beings or in an animal reservoir, quantification of uncertainty in transmissibility estimates, and provision of the first estimates of the scale of the epidemic and extent of case detection biases, we provide valuable information for more informed risk assessment.

Hong Kong is characterized by high population density, and is susceptible to large-scale natural disasters and health crises such as typhoons, fires and infectious disease outbreaks. This research paper investigates the rates and predictors of urban community disaster risk perception, awareness and preparedness, at individual and household levels. Methods: A randomized cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey study was conducted among the Cantonese-speaking population aged over 15 years in Hong Kong. Descriptive statistics were reported. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the independent associations between risk perceptions, socioeconomic factors, household characteristics, and personal background. Findings: Final study sample comprised of 1002 respondents with a 63% response rate. The majority of respondents (82.3%) did not perceive Hong Kong as a disaster-susceptible city. Half (54.6%) reported beliefs that the local population had lower disaster awareness than other global cities. Infectious disease outbreak (72.4%), typhoon (12.6%), and fire (7.1%) were ranked as the most-likely-to-occur population-based disasters. Although over 77% believed that basic first aid training was necessary for improving individual disaster preparedness, only a quarter (26.1%) of respondents reported participation in training. Conclusion: Despite Hong Kong\u2019s high level of risk, general public perceptions of disaster in Hong Kong were low, and little preparedness has occurred at the individual or household levels.

However, this complicated protocol may have a downside. Furthermore, the Joint Taiwan Critical Care Medicine Committee has launched a nationwide educational program after the publication of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) to improve the overall survival rate from septicemia in the emergency care system of Taiwan. Objectives To assess the impact of the EGDT protocol and SSC education programs on island-wide septicemia-related emergency department (ED) visits. Methods Segmented regression techniques were utilized to assess the differences in annual rates and changes in septicemia-related ED visits between 1998 and 2012. We considered annual incidence of two medical comorbidities as potential confounders: metastatic malignant neoplasms and malignant neoplasms of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues. Results The EGDT protocol was associated with decreased septicemia-related ED visits in 2002 (level change; p \u003C 0.001), while the SSC education program led to a slight increase in septicemia-related ED visits in 2007 (slope change; p \u003C 0.001). For the EGDT protocol, the number of patient visits decreased by 32.9% after the protocol was implemented in 2002 compared with the expected number without the intervention. For the SSC education program, the number of patient visits increased by 20.2% (compared with the predicted number) in 2007 after the education program was implemented. Conclusions The EGDT protocol and SSC education program were associated with significant immediate changes and lagged intervention effects on island-wide septicemia-related ED visits.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tzeng, I-Shiang; Chien, Kuo-Liong; Tu, Yu-Kang; Chen, Jau-Yuan; Ng, Chau Yee; Chien, Cheng-Yu; Chen, Jih-Chang; Chaou, Chung-Hsien; Yiang, Giou-Teng","journal":"Health Policy and Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36a8d9aff8433686752025c8699d5a5ffc6e9ceb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104157.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2018.01.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211883718300224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289003/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211883718300224","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["SSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EGDT protocol","decreased septicemia-related ED visits","island-wide septicemia-related ED visits","number of patient visits","complicated protocol","SSC education programs","island-wide septicemia-related emergency department","outcomes of septicemia treatment","expected number","predicted number","nationwide educational program","emergency care system of Taiwan","metastatic malignant neoplasms","significant immediate changes","significant reduction","level change","slope change","annual rates","annual incidence","lagged intervention effects","Joint Taiwan Critical Care Medicine Committee","potential confounders","medical comorbidities","slight increase","publication","early goal","lymphatic","therapy","overall survival rate","Surviving Sepsis Campaign","differences","costs","Abstract Background","impact","Conclusions","hematopoietic tissues","case fatality","regression techniques","Methods","downside","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Numerous properties of ORF6 have been documented and this study focuses on two of these, namely, its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs and its subcellular localization to vesicular structures. RESULTS: Using a transient transfection system, ORF6\u0027s ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs was measured in a quantitative manner. While ORF6 does not have a global effect on protein synthesis, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that it down-regulated the mRNA level of the co-transfected myc-nsp8 gene. Furthermore, alanine substitution of a diacidic cluster motif (aa53-56) in the ORF6 gene caused a reduction in the suppression of expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8 gene. Our previous study revealed that ORF6 localized to vesicular structures in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Here, ORF6 was observed to be localized to similar vesicular structures in Vero E6 cells which have been transiently transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid encoding for untagged ORF6. ORF6 showed partial colocalization with cellular proteins CD63 and Lamp1, suggesting that the vesicular structures may be a subpopulation of endosomal/lysosomal vesicles. The alanine substitution of the diacidic cluster motif also altered the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein, indicating a potential relationship between the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein and its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs. CONCLUSIONS: By combining quantitative real-time PCR and transient transfection system, a simple and safe method is established to measure ORF6\u0027s ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8. In addition, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the subcellular localization of ORF6 when expressed on its own is similar to that observed in SARS-CoV infected cells. Through the use of these two assays, a putative diacidic motif in the ORF6 protein was found to influence its subcellular localization and ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs.","publish_time":"2011-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gunalan, Vithiagaran; Mirazimi, Ali; Tan, Yee-Joo","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d8f8313ebf345a47ae755d7f470b393a79893fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3219739.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22026976/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-4-446","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ORF6 protein","ORF6 gene","expression of co-transfected expression constructs","subcellular localization of ORF6","untagged ORF6","expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8","suppression of expression","Numerous properties of ORF6","co-transfected myc-nsp8 gene","mammalian expression plasmid","s ability","similar vesicular structures","protein synthesis","SARS-CoV infected cells","diacidic cluster motif","SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells","quantitative real-time PCR","putative diacidic motif","transient transfection system","quantitative manner","alanine substitution","accessory proteins","previous study","cellular proteins CD63","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Lamp1","partial colocalization","global effect","potential relationship","subpopulation of endosomal","safe method","assays","immunofluorescence analysis","mRNA level","aa53","reduction","lysosomal vesicles","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","addition","BACKGROUND","use"],"language":"en"},

Rural Cambodian households may face an increased likelihood of exposure to zoonotic diseases as people there live in close association with livestock. The objectives of the study was to identify practices known to influence zoonosis transmission in rural Cambodian households and relate the practices to agro-ecological region, socio-economic position, demographics, livestock management and zoonosis awareness. METHODS: The study was conducted in three different agro-ecological regions of Cambodia; 10 villages each in the central lowlands, north-west wetlands and on the south coast, where information was obtained in questionnaires administered to 300 households, and 30 village heads and animal health workers. RESULTS: Descriptive analysis revealed a gender difference in responsibility for livestock and that the main purpose of raising livestock was for sale. Few respondents (6%) perceived a likelihood of disease transmission in their village between livestock, humans and wildlife, despite household practices related to zoonosis transmission being common. More than one-forth of households practised behaviours such as culling sick animals for consumption, eating animals found dead and allowing animals to enter sleeping and food preparation areas. Associations between household practices and possible explanatory factors were analysed with multivariable models using generalised estimation equations to account for clustering of practices within villages. Factors found to influence household practices were agro-ecological region, socio-economic position, number of people in the household, livestock species reared and awareness of zoonoses. CONCLUSIONS: Cambodia has experienced numerous fatal human cases of zoonotic influenza and extensive influenza information campaigns have been run, yet only a few of the households surveyed here reported the threat of zoonosis to be a concern in their village. Zoonosis awareness was positively related to hand washing behaviour, but other practices associated with an increased or decreased likelihood of exposure to zoonotic pathogens were unaffected by awareness. The findings indicate a knowledge-to-action gap among rural farmers and highlight the necessity for reconstructed interventions in zoonotic disease control.

Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of MBL in infection by dengue virus (DENV), a related flavivirus. Using a panel of na\u00EFve sera from mouse strains deficient in different complement components, we showed that inhibition of infection by insect cell- and mammalian cell-derived DENV was primarily dependent on the lectin pathway. Human MBL also bound to DENV and neutralized infection of all four DENV serotypes through complement activation-dependent and -independent pathways. Experiments with human serum from na\u00EFve individuals with inherent variation in the levels of MBL in blood showed a direct correlation between the concentration of MBL and neutralization of DENV; samples with high levels of MBL in blood neutralized DENV more efficiently than those with lower levels.

The application of a newly developed multi-criteria decision-making tool called RR-PARETO2 is presented. An example of HVAC design is used to illustrate how solutions could be selected within a multi-criteria optimization framework. In this example, five criteria have been selected, namely, power consumption, thermal comfort, risk of airborne infection of influenza and tuberculosis and effective differential temperature (\u0394t eq) of body parts. The goal is to select the optimal air exchange rate that makes reasonable trade-offs among all the objectives. Two scenarios have been studied. In the first scenario, there is an influenza outbreak and the important objective is to prevent the spread of infection. In the second scenario, energy prices are high and the primary objective is to reduce energy. In both scenarios, RR-PARETO2 algorithm selects solutions that make reasonable trade-offs among conflicting objectives. The example illustrates how objectives such as reduction of airborne disease transmission and maximizing thermal comfort can be incorporated in the design of a practical, full-scale HVAC system.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pantelic, Jovan; Raphael, Benny; Tham, Kwok Wai","journal":"Energy and Buildings","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c18608fb7d5a7ed7ad4040d773d40debf3fe7c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127488.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877881200237X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037877881200237X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.04.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288123/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["example of HVAC design","reasonable trade-offs","thermal comfort","multi-criteria optimization framework","design solution","solutions","conflicting objectives","scenarios","developed multi-criteria decision-making tool","risk of airborne infection of influenza","articulated preference of multiple criteria","RR-PARETO2 algorithm","influenza outbreak","primary objective","important objective","energy prices","spread of infection","full-scale HVAC system","reduction of airborne disease transmission","tuberculosis","effective differential temperature","\u0394t eq","best accords","optimal air exchange rate","acceptable performance band","power consumption","body parts","issue","application","goal","paper"],"language":"en"},

Next, the investigation validated the model using two sets of experimental data from a cabin mockup and an actual airplane. This study then used the validated model to systematically investigate the impact of gaspers on cabin air quality in a seven-row section of the fully-occupied, economy-class cabin of Boeing 767 and 737 airplanes. The CFD calculations formed a database consisting of 9660 data points that provide information about SARS infection risk. It was found that the distribution of opened gaspers can influence the infection risk for passengers. Even though the gasper supplies clean air, it is possible for it to have a negative impact on the passengers\u0027 health. Statistically speaking, the overall effect of turning on the gaspers on the mean infection risk for the general population was neutral.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"You, Ruoyu; Chen, Jun; Lin, Chao-Hsin; Wei, Daniel; Chen, Qingyan","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6a3dcbb275842d4af9637a3c824b6e0a945ceb6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117005.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.10.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132316304176; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132316304176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287968/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Boeing","CFD","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of gaspers","cabin air quality","air distribution","distribution of opened gaspers","cabin mockup","aircraft cabin","clean air","validated model","SARS infection risk","mean infection risk","study","economy-class cabin of Boeing","hybrid turbulence model","data points","negative impact","sets of experimental data","general population","information","cabins of commercial airliners","database","passengers\u0027 health","actual airplane","row section","CFD calculations","investigation","airplanes","overall effect","question"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We performed a 16-center, prospective cohort study of hospitalized children aged \u003C2 years with a physician admitting diagnosis of bronchiolitis. For 3 consecutive years, from November 1, 2007 until March 31, 2010, site teams collected data from participating families, including information about prenatal maternal smoking and postnatal tobacco exposure. Analyses used chi-square, Fisher\u0027s exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 2207 enrolled children, 216 (10%) had isolated in utero exposure to maternal smoking, 168 (8%) had isolated postnatal tobacco exposure, and 115 (5%) experienced both. Adjusting for age, sex, race, birth weight, viral etiology, apnea, initial severity of retractions, initial oxygen saturation, oral intake, and postnatal tobacco exposure, children with in utero exposure to maternal smoking had greater odds of being admitted to the ICU (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14\u20132.00). Among children with in utero exposure to maternal smoking, those with additional postnatal tobacco exposure had a greater likelihood of ICU admission (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13\u20133.37) compared to children without postnatal tobacco smoke exposure (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.05\u20132.04). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy puts children hospitalized with bronchiolitis at significantly higher risk of intensive care use. Postnatal tobacco smoke exposure may exacerbate this risk. Health care providers should incorporate this information into counseling messages.","publish_time":"2015-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stevenson, Michelle D.; Mansbach, Jonathan M.; Mowad, Eugene; Dunn, Michelle; Clark, Sunday; Piedra, Pedro A.; Sullivan, Ashley F.; Camargo, Carlos A.","journal":"Acad Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ed12f805a2e0d01b6a0390af969f3de12a3edb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4871768.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187628591500340X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2015.11.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187628591500340X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26555856/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["utero exposure","postnatal tobacco smoke exposure","isolated postnatal tobacco exposure","additional postnatal tobacco exposure","maternal cigarette smoking","prenatal maternal smoking","enrolled children","aOR","prospective cohort study of hospitalized children","risk of admission","information","greater likelihood of ICU admission","greater odds","higher risk of intensive care use","intensive care unit","diagnosis of bronchiolitis","Health care providers","consecutive years","initial severity of retractions","initial oxygen saturation","adjusted odds ratio","oral intake","viral etiology","apnea","Kruskal-Wallis tests","birth weight","participating families","race","pregnancy","Fisher\u0027s exact","data","multivariable logistic regression","chi-square","sex","site teams","center","CONCLUSIONS","associations","confidence interval","Analyses","physician","counseling messages","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

An OR with a negative pressure environment located at a corner of the operating complex, and with a separate access, is designated for all confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 cases. The OR actually consists of five interconnected rooms, of which only the ante room and anesthesia induction rooms have negative atmospheric pressures. The OR proper, preparation, and scrub rooms all have positive pressures (eFig. 1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material [ESM]). Understanding the airflow within the OR is crucial to minimizing the risk of infection. The same OR and the same anesthesia machine will only be used for COVID-19 cases for the duration of the epidemic. An additional heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter is placed on the expiratory limb of the circuit. Both HME filters and the soda lime are changed after each case. The anesthetic drug trolley is kept in the induction room. Before the start of each operation, the anesthesiologist puts all the drugs and equipment required for the procedure onto a tray to avoid handling of the drug trolley during the case. Nevertheless, if there is a need for additional drugs, hand hygiene and glove changing are performed before entering the induction room and handling the drug trolley.SN - 1496-8975","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ti, Lian Kah; Ang, Lin Stella; Foong, Theng Wai; Ng, Bryan Su Wei","journal":"Can J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17dc9f600d774888aa379aa5574144d5f2a7e3b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01617-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32144591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["cases of COVID","case of COVID","suspected COVID","operating room","anesthesia induction rooms","ante room","scrub rooms","additional drugs","interconnected rooms","Singapore","anesthetic drug trolley","handling","negative atmospheric pressures","additional heat","positive pressures","HME filters","anesthesia machine","operating complex","negative pressure environment","Wax","hand hygiene","Journal","corner","moisture exchanger","Christian1","glove changing","coronavirus disease","anesthesiologist","procedure","need","soda lime","World Health Organization","Electronic Supplementary Material","ESM","expiratory limb","recent review","equipment","separate access","preparation","country","tray","eFig","hospital","patients","duration","risk of infection","mainland China","circuit","start","operation","epidemic","surgery","airflow","protocol","week"],"language":"en"},

However, on day 3 post-infection, Pigeon04 induced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6 and TNF\u03B1) and MIP-2, neutrophil chemoattractant, in the lungs, resulting in severe pneumonia that was accompanied by neutrophil infiltration. In contrast, on day 7 post-infection, T.sparrow05 induced the expression of several cytokines to a greater extent than Pigeon04; it also potently induced mRNA expression of several cytokines in brains of the infected mice that triggered frequent inflammatory events.

The meeting functioned as a platform for free brainstorming, in-depth discussion, and post-meeting synthesizing. Through the meeting, we have reached a consensus that global health can be considered as a general guiding principle, an organizing framework for thinking and action, a new branch of sciences and specialized discipline in the large family of public health and medicine. The word \u201Cglobal\u201D in global health can be subjective or objective, depending on the context and setting. In addition to dual-, multi-country and global, a project or a study conducted at a local area can be global if it (1) is framed with a global perspective, (2) intends to address an issue with global impact, and/or (3) seeks global solutions to an issue, such as frameworks, strategies, policies, laws, and regulations. In this regard, global health is eventually an extension of \u201Cinternational health\u201D by borrowing related knowledge, theories, technologies and methodologies from public health and medicine. Although global health is a concept that will continue to evolve, our conceptualization through group effort provides, to date, a comprehensive understanding.

The genomes are organized with their nonstructural proteins encoded at the 5\u2032 end with the structural proteins at the 3\u2032 end. Characteristically, the two open reading frames are separated by an untranslated region that is capable of acting as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In addition to the structural proteins being expressed from this IRES, translation usually initiates from a noncanonical amino acid, generally alanine. The dicistroviruses share a number of characteristics, for example, virion structure, genomic organization, and the absence of subgenomic RNAs with other picorna-like viruses of plants, animals, and protists that suggest a shared evolutionary origin and a higher-order taxonomic grouping for such viruses. Most dicistroviruses, with the exception of cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), have restricted host ranges and only infect species from a single insect order. In contrast, CrPV is able to infect over 20 species of insects and several insect cell lines. Most dicistroviruses have vertical and horizontal components in their transmission and generally produce few noticeable disease symptoms. Infection with dicistroviruses does, however, usually result in a shortened life span and reduced fecundity of the host.","publish_time":"2008-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Christian, P.D.; Scotti, P.D.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173455.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744104006087; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744104006087","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dicistroviruses","CrPV","single insect order","viruses of plants","IRES","nonstructural proteins","end","family of small icosahedral viruses","species of insects","single-stranded RNA","positive-sense genomes","restricted host ranges","insect cell lines","higher-order taxonomic grouping","example","genomic organization","transmission","protists","virion structure","shared evolutionary origin","reduced fecundity","picorna","exception of cricket paralysis virus","internal ribosome entry site","shortened life span","absence of subgenomic RNAs","horizontal components","number of characteristics","noncanonical amino acid","untranslated region","open reading frames","alanine","Dicistroviridae","translation","invertebrates","animals","noticeable disease symptoms","contrast","addition","Infection"],"language":"en"},

Considering the increased sensitivity, reproducibility and large dynamic range of this method, the requirements for proper internal reference gene(s) for relative expression normalization have become much more stringent. Given the increasing interest in the functional genomics of Eucalyptus, we sought to identify and experimentally verify suitable reference genes for the normalization of gene expression associated with the flower, leaf and xylem of six species of the genus. We selected 50 genes that exhibited the least variation in microarrays of E. grandis leaves and xylem, and E. globulus xylem. We further performed the experimental analysis using RT\u2013qPCR for six Eucalyptus species and three different organs/tissues. Employing algorithms geNorm and NormFinder, we assessed the gene expression stability of eight candidate new reference genes. Classic housekeeping genes were also included in the analysis. The stability profiles of candidate genes were in very good agreement. PCR results proved that the expression of novel Eucons04, Eucons08 and Eucons21 genes was the most stable in all Eucalyptus organs/tissues and species studied. We showed that the combination of these genes as references when measuring the expression of a test gene results in more reliable patterns of expression than traditional housekeeping genes. Hence, novel Eucons04, Eucons08 and Eucons21 genes are the best suitable references for the normalization of expression studies in the Eucalyptus genus.","publish_time":"2011-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Oliveira, Luisa Abruzzi; Breton, Mich\u00E8le Claire; Bastolla, Fernanda Macedo; Camargo, Sandro da Silva; Margis, Rog\u00E9rio; Frazzon, Jeverson; Pasquali, Giancarlo","journal":"Plant Cell Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20552486da880c61b120a7a966f1ba4bcbeb8702.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107212.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22197885/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcr187","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Eucons21 genes","normalization of gene expression","Gene expression analysis","gene expression stability","suitable reference genes","accurate expression profiling of selected genes","relative expression normalization","normalization of expression studies","expression of novel Eucons04","traditional housekeeping genes","Classic housekeeping genes","candidate new reference genes","stability profiles of candidate genes","reliable patterns of expression","Eucalyptus species","Eucalyptus organs","Eucalyptus genus","test gene results","proper internal reference gene","RT","qPCR","Eucons08","PCR results","functional genomics of Eucalyptus","tissues","globulus xylem","experimental analysis","best suitable references","method of choice","quantitative PCR","different organs","reverse transcription","high-throughput","large dynamic range","biological research","requirements","reproducibility","increased sensitivity","leaves","NormFinder","leaf","flower","microarrays of","variation","good agreement","algorithms geNorm","combination"],"language":"en"},

Why are viruses more dangerous in one species than another? Immunological studies investigating quantitative and qualitative differences in the host-virus equilibrium in animal reservoirs will be key to answering this question, informing new approaches for treating and preventing zoonotic diseases. Integrating an understanding of host immune responses with epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary insights into viral emergence will shed light on mechanisms that minimize fitness costs associated with viral infection, facilitate transmission to other hosts, and underlie the association of specific reservoir hosts with multiple emerging viruses.

In contrast, TSLP activates dendritic cells to induce strong T-cell proliferation and is involved in inflammatory T helper (Th) 2 responses in human allergic diseases. However, it is not clear how TSLP production by IECs is regulated in ulcerative colitis (UC), which appears to involve inflammatory Th2 responses. The aim of this study is to examine how TSLP production by IECs is regulated in ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: We show here that expression of TSLP was enhanced in mucosal lesions from UC patients in which inflammatory Th2 cytokine production was predominant. In addition, using a human colonic epithelial cell line, we demonstrated that a combination of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03B1) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) induced TSLP expression and that TSLP expression by TNF-\u03B1 \u002B IL-4 was further enhanced by either Toll-like receptor 3 ligand or interferon (IFN)-\u03B3. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, as in human allergic diseases, an inflammatory Th2 condition in the mucosal lesions of UC patients may trigger increased TSLP expression by IECs, resulting in exacerbation of UC.","publish_time":"2009-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tanaka, Junya; Saga, Kazuyuki; Kido, Masahiro; Nishiura, Hisayo; Akamatsu, Takuji; Chiba, Tsutomu; Watanabe, Norihiko","journal":"Dig Dis Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d980a695d2332d96d6ab4638f5c7d445742e5f8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087909.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19757042/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-009-0979-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Thymic"],"organizations":["TSLP","UC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of TSLP","TSLP production","increased TSLP expression","IECs","TSLP-conditioned dendritic cells","inflammatory Th2 condition","inflammatory Th2 responses","inflammatory Th2 cytokine production","mucosal lesions of UC patients","exacerbation of UC","inflammatory T helper","human allergic diseases","TNF-\u03B1","intestinal epithelial cells","IL","ulcerative colitis","human colonic epithelial cell line","strong T-cell proliferation","physiological condition","combination of tumor necrosis factor-alpha","immunoglobulin","receptor","ligand","interferon","IFN","class","PURPOSE","Thymic stromal lymphopoietin","immune homeostasis of intestine","addition","interleukin","study","contrast","Toll","aim","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The hemagglutinin (HA), one of eight protein-coding genes, plays an important role during the early stage of infection. To study their evolution and zoonotic potential, we conducted an in silico analysis of H9N2 viruses that have infected broiler in Tehran Province, Iran between 1998 and 2007. The complete coding region of HA genes from nine H9N2 subtypes isolated from chicken flocks in Tehran Province during 1998\u20132007 was amplified and sequenced. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies of H9N2 subtype viruses on the basis of data of 9 viruses in this study and 30 selected strains are available in the GenBank. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed a large number of similar substitution mutations and close evolutionary relation among sequences of HA. The isolates possessed two types of amino acid motif \u2013R\u2013S-S-R/G-L- and -R-S-N-R/G-L- at the cleavage site of HA. The results showed that all nine representative H9N2 isolates belong to low pathogenic AIVs since none of the amino acid sequences at the cleavage site of the HA of the isolates possessed the basic motif required for highly pathogenic viruses (R-X-R/K-R). Six out of these nine isolates possessed leucine at position 226, which prevails in the sequences found in human strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all our isolates belonged to the G1-like sublineage. Also, these isolates showed some degree of homology with other H9N2 isolates, e.g., 89.46\u201393.93.39% with qu/HK/G1/97 and 93.39\u201398.39% with pa/Narita/92A/98. The available evidence indicates that HA genes of H9 influenza virus circulating in Iran during the past years were not well conserved. Our finding emphasizes the importance of reinforcing AIV surveillance, especially after the emergence of high pathogenicity in poultry in Iran.","publish_time":"2012-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghalyanchi Langeroudi, Arash; Karimi, Vahid; Tavasoti Kheiri, Masoumeh; Barin, Abbas","journal":"Comp Clin Path","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30673539510b965bacfbbb60fd303b7c22597de8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087803.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00580-012-1405-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA","R-X-R/K-R"],"locations":["Iran","Tehran"],"keyphrases":["R-S","representative H9N2 isolates","sequences of HA","R-X","Iran","N-R","silico analysis of H9N2 viruses","pathogenic viruses","H9N2 subtypes","cleavage site of HA","phylogenetic studies of H9N2 subtype viruses","S-S","H9N2 avian influenza","Phylogenetic analysis","HA genes of H9 influenza virus","complete coding region of HA genes","Sequence analysis","amino acid sequences","protein-coding genes","phylogenetic analyses","Tehran Province","study","G1","types of amino acid motif","basic motif","selected strains","available evidence","human strains","low pathogenic AIVs","importance of reinforcing AIV surveillance","large number of similar substitution mutations","close evolutionary relation","infected broiler","important role","chicken flocks","basis of data","emergence of high pathogenicity","decade","poultry","panzootic","early stage of infection","degree of homology","past years","chickens","finding","Eurasia","inactivated vaccine","GenBank","zoonotic potential","HK","results","leucine","position","Narita","disease","sublineage","hemagglutinin"],"language":"en"},

Concomitantly, with this increase in travel is the increase in post travel-related diseases, such as respiratory illnesses. Identifying the cause of the posttravel respiratory illness is a complex challenge for many healthcare professionals because similar presentations occur for both infectious and noninfectious causes. Not only is diagnosis important but also transmission prevention. In the last two decades, there have been several severe infectious respiratory syndromes that have spread through international travel causing epidemics in many countries. RECENT FINDINGS: A detailed travel history with the chronology of symptoms paired with the patient\u0027s medical risk factors and exposures along with some basic knowledge of infectious respiratory illnesses will help facilitate clinical decision making. This framework will help create a broad, but appropriate differential diagnosis to guide clinical workup, prevent delays in diagnosis, and implement the appropriate precautions to prevent transmission if appropriate. SUMMARY: The foundation to diagnosing a travel-related respiratory illness lies within integrating the patient\u0027s travel history, comorbid conditions, clinical presentation, exposures, and mode of transmission. A timely and accurate diagnosis benefits not only the patient but also the surrounding community to prevent further individual transmission, epidemics, and pandemics.","publish_time":"2016-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duong, Theresa N.; Waldman, Sarah E.","journal":"Curr Emerg Hosp Med Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc1a723c2049ce7bdca7cfb5f5e8370c29c29c02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100244.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226655/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40138-016-0109-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["International travel","travel-related respiratory illness","patient\u0027s travel history","detailed travel history","post travel-related diseases","posttravel respiratory illness","appropriate differential diagnosis","severe infectious respiratory syndromes","accurate diagnosis","diagnosis important","individual transmission","mode of transmission","transmission prevention","basic knowledge of infectious respiratory illnesses","exposures","clinical presentation","clinical workup","appropriate precautions","increase","epidemics","clinical decision making","patient\u0027s medical risk factors","comorbid conditions","complex challenge","chronology of symptoms","healthcare professionals","similar presentations","surrounding community","RECENT FINDINGS","pandemics","foundation","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","delays","countries","noninfectious causes","fast pace","SUMMARY","framework","decades"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, whilst the great majority of cellular mRNAs are apparently monocistronic, RNA viruses must often express multiple proteins from their mRNAs. In addition, RNA viruses have very compact genomes and are under intense selective pressure to optimize usage of the available sequence space. Together, these features have driven the evolution of a plethora of non-canonical translational mechanisms in RNA viruses that help them to meet these challenges. Here, we review the mechanisms utilized by RNA viruses of eukaryotes, focusing on internal ribosome entry, leaky scanning, non-AUG initiation, ribosome shunting, reinitiation, ribosomal frameshifting and stop-codon readthrough.

Competing with cellular protein translation apparatus needs to ensure the production of viral proteins, but this also stifles host innate defense. In the present study, we showed that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), whose replication takes place in the cytoplasm, imprisoned host cell mRNA in the nucleus, which suggests a novel mechanism to enhance translation of PRRSV genome. PRRSV nonstructural protein (nsp) 1\u03B2 was identified as the nuclear protein playing the role for host mRNA nuclear retention and subversion of host protein synthesis. A SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) motif was identified in nsp1\u03B2 with the consensus sequence of 126-LQxxLxxxGL-135. In situ hybridization unveiled that SAP mutants were unable to cause nuclear retention of host cell mRNAs and did not suppress host protein synthesis. In addition, these SAP mutants reverted PRRSV-nsp1\u03B2-mediated suppression of interferon (IFN) production, IFN signaling, and TNF-\u03B1 production pathway. Using reverse genetics, a series of SAP mutant PRRS viruses, vK124A, vL126A, vG134A, and vL135A were generated. No mRNA nuclear retention was observed during vL126A and vL135A infections. Importantly, vL126A and vL135A did not suppress IFN production. For other arteriviruses, mRNA nuclear accumulation was also observed for LDV-nsp1\u03B2 and SHFV-nsp1\u03B2.

Popular discontent with the health system has led to major reforms. To help inform these reforms, we did a comprehensive assessment of disease burden in China, how it changed between 1990 and 2010, and how China\u0027s health burden compares with other nations. METHODS: We used results of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) for 1990 and 2010 for China and 18 other countries in the G20 to assess rates and trends in mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We present results for 231 diseases and injuries and for 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors relevant to China. We assessed relative performance of China against G20 countries (significantly better, worse, or indistinguishable from the G20 mean) with age-standardised rates and 95% uncertainty intervals. FINDINGS: The leading causes of death in China in 2010 were stroke (1\u00B77 million deaths, 95% UI 1\u00B75\u20131\u00B78 million), ischaemic heart disease (948 700 deaths, 774 500\u20131 024 600), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (934 000 deaths, 846 600\u20131 032 300). Age-standardised YLLs in China were lower in 2010 than all emerging economies in the G20, and only slightly higher than noted in the USA. China had the lowest age-standardised YLD rate in the G20 in 2010. China also ranked tenth (95% UI eighth to tenth) for HALE and 12th (11th to 13th) for life expectancy. YLLs from neonatal causes, infectious diseases, and injuries in children declined substantially between 1990 and 2010. Mental and behavioural disorders, substance use disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders were responsible for almost half of all YLDs. The fraction of DALYs from YLDs rose from 28\u00B71% (95% UI 24\u00B72\u201332\u00B75) in 1990 to 39\u00B74% (34\u00B79\u201343\u00B78) in 2010. Leading causes of DALYs in 2010 were cardiovascular diseases (stroke and ischaemic heart disease), cancers (lung and liver cancer), low back pain, and depression. Dietary risk factors, high blood pressure, and tobacco exposure are the risk factors that constituted the largest number of attributable DALYs in China. Ambient air pollution ranked fourth (third to fifth; the second highest in the G20) and household air pollution ranked fifth (fourth to sixth; the third highest in the G20) in terms of the age-standardised DALY rate in 2010. INTERPRETATION: The rapid rise of non-communicable diseases driven by urbanisation, rising incomes, and ageing poses major challenges for China\u0027s health system, as does a shift to chronic disability. Reduction of population exposures from poor diet, high blood pressure, tobacco use, cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose are public policy priorities for China, as are the control of ambient and household air pollution. These changes will require an integrated government response to improve primary care and undertake required multisectoral action to tackle key risks. Analyses of disease burden provide a useful framework to guide policy responses to the changing disease spectrum in China.

Methods Background mechanisms of five erroneous declarations in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone during 2014\u20132016 were reviewed.

Conclusions The events of recrudescence were associated with relatively uncommon routes of transmission other than close contact during burial or care-giving, including sexual transmission, possible immunocompromise, and migration.

Although virus-specific CTLs play a pivotal role to eliminate virus-infected cells, the potential role of HTLV-1\u2013specific CTLs in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains unclear. To address this issue, we evaluated the infiltration of HTLV-1\u2013specific CTLs and the expression of HTLV-1 proteins in the spinal cords of 3 patients with HAM/TSP. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with our unique staining procedure made it possible to visualize HTLV-1\u2013specific CTLs infiltrating the CNS of the HAM/TSP patients. The frequency of HTLV-1\u2013specific CTLs was more than 20% of CD8-positive cells infiltrating the CNS. In addition, HTLV-1 proteins were detected in CD4-positive infiltrating T lymphocytes but not CNS resident cells. Although neurons were generally preserved, apoptotic oligodendrocytes were frequently in contact with CD8-positive cells; this likely resulted in demyelination. These findings suggest that the immune responses of the CTLs against HTLV-1\u2013infected CD4-positive lymphocytes migrating into the CNS resulted in bystander neural damage.","publish_time":"2014-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matsuura, Eiji; Kubota, Ryuji; Tanaka, Yuetsu; Takashima, Hiroshi; Izumo, Shuji","journal":"J Neuropathol Exp Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2b148720d1cf79fbeac9a409962bf9e2e190c4a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/566fb147c952fff9010fe4aff377f6a460b6fde2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4336315.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470342/; https://doi.org/10.1097/nen.0000000000000141","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTLV","CNS","HAM/TSP","Confocal"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of HTLV","infiltration of HTLV","frequency of HTLV","virus-specific CTLs","potential role of HTLV","CD8-positive cells","specific CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes","CNS resident cells","CD4-positive infiltrating T lymphocytes","infected CD4-positive lymphocytes","virus-infected cells","TSP patients","pathogenesis of HAM","proteins","periphery of patients","human T-lymphotropic virus type","pivotal role","Confocal laser scanning microscopy","unique staining procedure","tropical spastic paraparesis","associated myelopathy","contact","spinal cords","immune responses","apoptotic oligodendrocytes","bystander neural damage","inflammatory disease","neurons","findings","demyelination","addition","issue"],"language":"en"},

Mechanistic studies pinpoint multiple SREBP proteolytic processes and SREBP-regulated lipid biosynthesis pathways, including the downstream viral protein palmitoylation and double-membrane vesicles formation, that are indispensable for virus replication.

I then discuss the degree to which the patterns expected, based solely on molecular-level structural characteristics, agree with observations regarding the ability of animal viruses to infect humans. This approach yields predictions consistent with empirical observations regarding the ability of specific viral families to infect novel host species but highlights the need for consideration of other factors, such as the ecology of host interactions and the determinants of cellular susceptibility and permissivity to specific virus groups, when trying to predict the frequency with which a virus will encounter a novel host species or the probability of propagation within a novel host species once infection has occurred.","publish_time":"2008-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pulliam, Juliet R.

The incidence of foodborne diseases has been underreported and underestimated, and the asymptomatic presentation of some of the illnesses, worldwide heterogeneities in reporting, and the alternative transmission routes of certain pathogens are among the factors that contribute to this. Globalization, centralization of the food supply, transportation of food products progressively farther from their places of origin, and the multitude of steps where contamination may occur have made it increasingly challenging to investigate foodborne and waterborne outbreaks. Certain foodborne pathogens may be transmitted directly from animals to humans, while others are transmitted through vectors, such as insects, or through food handlers, contaminated food products or food-processing surfaces, or transfer from sponges, cloths, or utensils. Additionally, the airborne route may contribute to the transmission of certain foodborne pathogens. Complicating epidemiological investigations, multiple transmission routes have been described for some foodborne pathogens. Two types of transmission barriers, primary and secondary, have been described for foodborne pathogens, each of them providing opportunities for preventing and controlling outbreaks. Primary barriers, the most effective sites of prophylactic intervention, prevent pathogen entry into the environment, while secondary barriers prevent the multiplication and dissemination of pathogens that have already entered the environment. Understanding pathogen dynamics, monitoring transmission, and implementing preventive measures are complicated by the phenomenon of superspreading, which refers to the concept that, at the level of populations, a minority of hosts is responsible for the majority of transmission events.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stein, R.

The antibody titring from 1:100 to 400 against the equine anti-SARS\u2013CoV F(ab\u2032)(2) in the inoculated hosts could be detected at week 2 during the successive injections of the equine F(ab\u2032)(2). The considerable safety of this antibody used in primates and the fact that the immune system of the host can be motivated by post-injection of the F(ab\u2032)(2) indicate that this type of anti-SARS\u2013CoV antibody can be used for prevention and treatment of SASR, especially at the early stage of this virus infection. In addition, it can also provide the precious time for the combined use of other anti-SARS\u2013CoV agents such as antiviral drug and vaccine.","publish_time":"2007-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Yunsheng; Jia, Zhengcai; Zhou, Liyun; Wang, Li; Li, Jintao; Liang, Yunfei; Zhao, TingTing; Ni, Bing; Wu, Yuzhang","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/452d86f7efa0e959a7fe78d341ec9590986ec3b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106090.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576907002901; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576907002901","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV F","CoV antibody","equine F","equine anti-SARS","type of anti-SARS","CoV agents","kind of antibody","antibody titring","injected animals","post-injection","local injection site","moderate immune response","safety test","immune system","considerable safety","mild inflammatory response","combined use","animal models","potential clinical testing","antiviral drug","successive injections","early stage","immunity","normal metabolism","fact","fragments","primates","prevention","pharmacokinetics","virus infection","treatment of SASR","tolerance","precious time","vaccine","primate model","macaques","rats","general physiological indexes","inoculated hosts","evaluation","Results","study","weeks","saline","addition"],"language":"en"},

It has been the target of interest for antiviral drug development due to its major role in replication. NS5 consists of two domains, the N-terminal methyltransferase domain and C-terminal catalytic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. It is an unstable protein and is prone to inactivation upon prolonged incubation at room temperature, thus affecting the inhibitor screening assays. In the current study, we expressed and purified DENV RdRp alone in Esherichia coli (E. coli) cells. The N-terminally His-tagged construct of DENV RdRp was transformed into E. coli expression strain BL-21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-\u03B2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.4mM. The induced cultures were then grown for 20h at 18\u00B0C and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000xg for 15min at 4\u00B0C. The recombinant protein was purified using HisTrap affinity column (Ni-NTA) and then the sample was subjected to size exclusion chromatography, which successfully removed the degradation product obtained during the previous purification step. The in vitro polymerase activity of RdRp was successfully demonstrated using homopolymeric polycytidylic acid (poly(rC)) RNA template. This study describes the high level production of enzymatically active DENV RdRp protein which can be used to develop assays for testing large number of compounds in a high-throughput manner. RdRp has the de novo initiation activity and the in vitro polymerase assays for the protein provide a platform for highly robust and efficient antiviral compound screening systems.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amraiz, Deeba; Zaidi, Najam-us-Sahar Sadaf; Fatima, Munazza","journal":"Enzyme and Microbial Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f428ac3d0008da6028acc83e36f9a9e61b1aa25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112394.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141022916301120; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2016.06.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141022916301120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542741/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["active DENV RdRp protein","purified DENV RdRp","Protein expression","polymerase activity of RdRp","construct of DENV RdRp","conserved protein","recombinant protein","unstable protein","polymerase assays","C-terminal catalytic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA template","Esherichia coli","inhibitor screening assays","pLysS cells","N-terminal methyltransferase domain","coli expression strain BL","current study","Abstract NS5","induced cultures","efficient antiviral compound screening systems","high level production","antiviral drug development","high-throughput manner","novo initiation activity","inactivation","rC","HisTrap affinity column","room temperature","IPTG","prolonged incubation","isopropyl-\u03B2","DE3","dengue virus","platform","homopolymeric polycytidylic acid","large number of compounds","D-thiogalactopyranoside","Ni-NTA","major role","sample","degradation product","domains","previous purification step","size exclusion chromatography","target","serotypes","centrifugation","final concentration","replication","xg"],"language":"en"},

Besides impacts of habitat changes caused by current rates of land conversion, climatic influences or predators, a contribution of infectious pathogens needs also to be considered. Infectious and non-infectious diseases in free-living populations of ring-necked pheasants have been scarcely investigated so far. In the present study, carcasses of 258 deceased free-ranging pheasants of different age groups, predominantly adult pheasants, collected over a period of 4 years in the states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine\u2013Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, were examined pathomorphologically, parasitologically, virologically and bacteriologically, with a focus set on infectious pathogens. A periocular and perinasal dermatitis of unknown origin was present in 62.3% of the pheasants. Additional alterations included protozoal cysts in the skeletal musculature (19.0%), hepatitis (21.7%), enteritis (18.7%), gastritis (12.6%), and pneumonia (11.7%). In single cases, neoplasms (2.6%) and mycobacteriosis (1.7%) occurred. Further findings included identification of coronaviral DNA from trachea or caecal tonsils (16.8%), siadenoviral DNA (7.6%), avian metapneumoviral RNA (6.6%), and infectious bursal disease viral RNA (3.7%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on herpesvirus, avian influenza virus (AIV), paramyxovirus type 1 (PMV-1), avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), and chlamydia were negative. Based on the present results, there is no indication of a specific pathogen as a sole cause for population decline in adult pheasants. However, an infectious disease can still not be completely excluded as it may only affect reproduction effectivity or a certain age group of pheasants (e.g., chicks) which were not presented in the study.","publish_time":"2018-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Curland, N.; Geth\u00F6ffer, F.; van Neer, A.; Ziegler, L.; Heffels-Redmann, U.; Lierz, M.; Baumg\u00E4rtner, W.; Wohlsein, P.; V\u00F6lker, I.; Lapp, S.; Bello, A.; Pfankuche, V.

METHOD: Recombinant RV1A infectious cDNA clones harboring the coding sequence of green fluorescent protein (GFP), Renilla luciferase, or iLOV (for light, oxygen, or voltage sensing) were engineered and constructed. RV\u2010infected cells were determined by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: RV1A\u2010GFP showed a cytopathic effect in HeLa cells but failed to express GFP or Renilla luciferase due to deletion. The smaller fluorescent protein construct, RV1A\u2010iLOV, was stably expressed in infected cells. RV1A\u2010iLOV expression was used to examine the antiviral effect of bafilomycin in HeLa cells. Compared to parental virus, RV1A\u2010iLOV infection of BALB/c mice yielded a similar viral load and level of cytokine mRNA expression. However, imaging of fixed lung tissue failed to reveal a fluorescent signal, likely due to the oxidation and bleaching of iLOV\u2010bound flavin mononucleotide. We therefore employed an anti\u2010iLOV antibody for immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence imaging. The iLOV signal was identified in airway epithelial cells and CD45\u002B CD11b\u002B lung macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RV1A\u2010iLOV is a useful molecular tool for studying RV pathogenesis. The construction strategy for RV1A\u2010iLOV could be applied to other RV serotypes. However, the detection of iLOV\u2010expressing RV in fixed tissue required the use of an anti\u2010iLOV antibody, limiting the value of this construct.","publish_time":"2018-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Mingyuan; Rajput, Charu; Hinde, Joanna L.; Wu, Qian; Lei, Jing; Ishikawa, Tomoko; Bentley, J.

The aim of this study was to map research productivity on the disease based on the articles indexed in PubMed. The articles related to MERS dated from 2012 to 2015 were retrieved from PubMed. The articles were classified into three categories according to their focus. Publication outputs were assessed and frequently used terms were mapped using the VOS viewer software. A total of 443 articles were included for analysis. They were published in 162 journals, with Journal of Virology being the most productive (44 articles; 9.9%) and by six types of organizations, with universities being the most productive (276 articles; 62.4%).The largest proportion of the articles focused on basic medical sciences and clinical studies (47.2%) and those on prevention and control ranked third (26.2%), with those on other focuses coming in between (26.6%). The articles on prevention and control had the highest mean rank for impact factor (IF) (226.34), followed by those on basic medical sciences and clinical studies (180.23) and those on other focuses (168.03). The mean rank differences were statistically significant (p = 0.000). Besides, \u201Cconronavirus\u201D, \u201Ccase\u201D, \u201Ctransmission\u201D and \u201Cdetection\u201D were found to be the most frequently used terms.

To investigate the cell tropism of FeMV-GT2 feline primary epithelial cells from the kidney, the urinary bladder and the lung, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as organotypic brain slice cultures were used for infection experiments. We demonstrate that FeMV-GT2 is able to infect renal and pulmonary epithelial cells, primary cells from the cerebrum and cerebellum, as well as immune cells in the blood, especially CD4(\u002B) T cells, CD20(\u002B) B cells and monocytes.

Despite Zika virus RNA was not detected, this study confirms circulation and/or sporadic spread of DENV\u20102, DENV\u20103, and AHFV, higher prevalence of DENV\u20102, and a role for visitors from DENV endemic countries in DENV importation into the Kingdom. Further analysis also showed very low genetic diversity of AHFV confirming its slow microevolution.

Alkaloids from a similar origin or having the same basic nucleus may have dissimilar biosynthetic pathways and different biological activity. They are derived from l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, anthranilic acid or acetate, l-histidine, l-ornithine, nicotinic acid, and l-lysine. Apart from other types of alkaloids, indole, tropane, and isoquinoline alkaloids are very important. People from all over the world are using them in their everyday life. Alkaloids can also have an animal origin, which may be endogenous or exogenous. This chapter highlights the phytochemistry of the main representatives among the diverse group of alkaloids. This chapter also focuses on their extraction, purification, fractionation, identification, and quantification procedures.

The large number of HCW deaths in Africa was in part due to lack of resources or prior training in PPE usage. As part of the Ebola legacy, the High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID) programme was initiated by NHS England and Public Health England (PHE) to improve preparedness for Ebola and other infections that not only endanger the life of the patient, but also pose particular dangers to HCWs. A systematic review identified national standardisation of PPE protocols as a priority, but recognised that a lack of safety data limited the ability to mandate any one protocol. A simulation-based exercise was developed to assess the safety of PPE ensembles in use in the UK during first assessment of a patient with a possible HCID. A mannequin was adapted to expose volunteer HCWs to synthetic bodily fluids (vomit, sweat, diarrhoea and cough), each with a different coloured fluorescent tracer, invisible other than under ultraviolet (UV) light. After exposure, HCWs were examined under UV lights to locate fluorescent contamination, and were screened again after removing PPE (doffing) to detect any personal contamination. The exercise was videoed, allowing retrospective analysis of contamination events and user errors. The simulation testing identified significant HCW contamination events after doffing, related to protocol failure or complications in PPE doffing, providing conclusive evidence that improvements could be made. At a workshop with an expert stakeholder group, the data were examined and a unified PPE ensemble agreed. This ensemble was then tested in the same simulation exercise and no evidence of any HCW contamination was seen after doffing. Following further review by the working group, a consensus agreement has been reached and a unified \u2018HCID assessment PPE\u2019 ensemble, with accompanying donning and doffing protocols, is presented here.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poller, Bozena; Tunbridge, Anne; Hall, Samantha; Beadsworth, Mike; Jacobs, Mike; Peters, Erica; Schmid, Matthias L; Sykes, Allison; Poran, Vin; Gent, Nick; Evans, Cariad; Crook, Brian","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa82190924919c14dc0c76619ce77d9dcfc9d007.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112614.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2018.08.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30176274/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445318302615; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445318302615","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","NHS England","UK","HCW"],"locations":["West Africa","Africa"],"keyphrases":["PPE doffing","PPE usage","HCID assessment PPE","unified PPE ensemble","safety of PPE ensembles","doffing protocols","personal contamination","fluorescent contamination","national standardisation of PPE protocols","significant HCW contamination events","simulation exercise","simulation-based exercise","retrospective analysis of contamination events","Ebola virus disease","Ebola legacy","volunteer HCWs","lack of safety data","possible HCID","patient","simulation testing","large number of HCW deaths","NHS England","lack of resources","conclusive evidence","working group","West Africa","UV lights","protocol failure","systematic review","Public Health England","expert stakeholder group","High Consequence Infectious Disease","different coloured fluorescent tracer","importance of appropriate personal protective equipment","vomit","synthetic bodily fluids","sweat","EVD","outbreak","PHE","programme","accompanying donning","protection","prior training","UK","complications","component of healthcare worker","user errors","cough","diarrhoea","Summary","preparedness","ability","priority","consensus agreement","workshop","infections","particular dangers","improvements","life","mannequin","exposure"],"language":"en"},

However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the outbreaker2 inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains.","publish_time":"2019-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campbell, Finlay; Cori, Anne; Ferguson, Neil; Jombart, Thibaut","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d486d51868e8d420880e5f21ae906a5150642763.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6457559.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30925168/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006930","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["genomic data","set of contact data","epidemiological data","temporal data","genome sequence data","types of outbreak data","sampled case data","close contact","contact tracing effort","inference of transmission trees","inferring transmission chains","various contact tracing scenarios","informative of transmission events","underlying transmission tree","individual transmission pairs","range of transmission scenarios consistent","SARS outbreak","outbreak reconstruction","genetic sequence","certain scenarios","probabilistic manner","infectious disease outbreak","outbreaks of pathogens","probabilistic model","better integration of genomic","SARS-CoV","rigorous manner","simulated outbreaks","computational tools","existing tools","flexible model","multiple pathogens lineages","outbreaker2 inference framework","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","EBOV","Ebola virus","coverage","analysis","recent studies","realistic limitations","host","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","approaches","early stages","mutations","Singapore","ability","non-infectious mixing","ad","little focus","improvement","cases","time","methodology"],"language":"en"},

The member genera include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, Torovirus, and Bafinivirus. The members of the family Coronaviridae are enveloped and positive stranded RNA viruses of three classes of vertebrates, which include corona- and toroviruses for mammals, coronaviruses for birds, and bafiniviruses for fishes. The nucleocapsids are helical and can be released from the virion by treatment with detergents. Where the coronavirus nucleocapsid appears to be loosely wound, those of the Torovirinae are distinctively tubular. The entire replication cycle takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the production of full-length and subgenome-sized (sg) minus-strand RNA intermediates with the viral genome serving both as mRNA for the replicase polyproteins and as a template for minus-strand synthesis. Members of the family Coronaviridae all seem to share two envelope protein species, the membrane (M) and spike (S) proteins. Similarities in size, predicted structures and presumed function(s) suggest a common ancestry, and the remote, but significant sequence similarities observed for toro-, bafini-, and (to lesser extent) coronavirus S proteins lend further support to this view. The replicase polyproteins of the Coronaviridae comprise a number of characteristic domains arranged in a conserved order.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Virus Taxonomy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b02fff00f306111d355bf3f5d1affab899cd066d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149967.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123846846000689; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123846846000689","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Coronaviridae family","family Coronaviridae","coronavirus S proteins","replicase polyproteins","members","Torovirinae","strand RNA intermediates","minus-strand synthesis","coronavirus nucleocapsid","significant sequence similarities","positive stranded RNA viruses","sg","predicted structures","presumed function","birds","Gammacoronavirus","Alphacoronavirus","Betacoronavirus","cytoplasm","classes of vertebrates","viral genome","template","number of characteristic domains","production of full-length","subgenome-sized","lesser extent","membrane","coronaviruses","place","toroviruses","mammals","mRNA","chapter","support","subfamilies","Coronavirinae","entire replication cycle","member genera","common ancestry","Publisher Summary","envelope protein species","bafiniviruses","conserved order","spike","virion","treatment","detergents","fishes","view"],"language":"en"},

Not surprisingly, RLRs and their associated signaling networks are also targeted by numerous antagonists that facilitate viral pathogenesis. Although the role of RLRs in orchestrating antiviral signaling has been recognized for some time, our knowledge of the complex regulatory mechanisms that control signaling through these key molecules is incomplete. A series of recent structural studies shed new light into the structural basis for dsRNA recognition and activation of RLRs. Collectively, these studies suggest that the repression of RLRs is facilitated by a cis element that makes multiple contacts with domains within the helicase and that RNA binding initiated by the C-terminal RNA binding domain is important for ATP hydrolysis and release of the CARD domain containing signaling module from the repressed conformation. These studies also highlight potential differences between RIG-I and MDA5, two RLR members. Together with previous studies, these new results bring us a step closer to uncovering the complex regulatory process of a key protein that protects host cells from invading pathogens.","publish_time":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Daisy W.; Amarasinghe, Gaya K.","journal":"Current Opinion in Structural Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb4c64a8a4b4af06830753ef69a26882742ba13a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/988378806c173a9d0cc4c2901e5c4c60d24328dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3383332.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2012.03.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X12000620; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3383332?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959440X12000620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22560447/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP","CARD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activation of RLRs","previous studies","role of RLRs","repression of RLRs","series of recent structural studies","RIG","C-terminal RNA binding domain","non-self RNA","complex regulatory process","complex regulatory mechanisms","activating host","new light","structural basis","CARD domain","host cells","new results","key protein","viral infections","key molecules","viral pathogenesis","RLR members","immune pathways","critical roles","ATP hydrolysis","response","dsRNA recognition","step closer","multiple contacts","release","domains","helicase","cis element","numerous antagonists","module","networks","MDA5","knowledge","invading pathogens","potential differences","orchestrating antiviral","receptors"],"language":"en"},

In the effusive form, antibody titers and protein electrophoresis in the effusions were analyzed. The distribution of the immune cells and of the virus in FIP lesions were also investigated immunohistochemically with the avidin\u2013biotin complex (ABC) method, using antibodies against the FIP virus (FIPV), myelomonocytic (MAC387) and lymphoid (CD3, CD4 and CD8 for T-cells and IgM and IgG for B-cells) antigens. Seropositive animals (antibody titer\u003E1:100) were present among both the FIP infected cats (73%) and the healthy cats (70%). Cats with effusive FIP had neutrophilic leukocytosis (P\u003E0.05), lymphopenia (P\u003C0.01) and eosinopenia (P\u003C0.001). In both effusive and noneffusive forms decreased albumin/globulin ratio (P\u003C0.001) with hypoalbuminemia (P\u003C0.001), hyperglobulinemia (P\u003C0.001) and increased \u03B12- (P\u003C0.05), \u03B2- (P\u003C0.05) and \u03B3-globulins (P\u003C0.001) were found. Hypergammaglobulinemia was not related to the antibody titers, suggesting the presence of other proteins with \u03B3-motility (e.g. complement fractions). The electrophoretic pattern of the effusions was always similar to that of the corresponding serum. Antibody titers higher than those of the corresponding serum were often detected in the effusions. Immunohistochemical findings were not related to the antibody titers, but they were related to the histological aspect of the lesions. In cellular foci of FIP lesions many virus-infected macrophages and few lymphocytes, mainly CD4\u002B, were found. Extracellular viral and myelomonocytic antigens were also detectable in the foci with intercellular necrosis. Only few FIPV-infected cells were present at the periphery of the larger necrotic foci: in these lesions MAC387\u002B cells were mainly neutrophils, with many MAC387\u2212 macrophages, probably due to their activated state; a small number of lymphocytes, with an increasing percentage of CD8\u002B cells was present. Lymphocytes were more abundant when cellular foci and FIP-infected macrophages were centered around neoformed vessels. IgM and IgG exposing B-cells were always few and scattered. In conclusion the simultaneous analysis of body fluids and of the cellular composition of the lesions showed a complex immune status, on which type III and type IV hypersensitivity could coexist.","publish_time":"1998-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paltrinieri, S; Cammarata, M.Parodi; Cammarata, G; Comazzi, S","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a5f35ad9bd248f8cde3618741807a6a20191956.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119882.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016524279800155X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016524279800155X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIP lesions","effusive FIP","FIP infected cats","FIP virus","cellular foci of FIP","FIP-infected macrophages","B-cells","immune cells","FIPV-infected cells","T-cells","Antibody titers higher","lesions MAC387","healthy cats","virus-infected macrophages","effusions","corresponding serum","serum protein electrophoresis","noneffusive forms","larger necrotic foci","cellular composition","IgG","IgM","myelomonocytic antigens","CD4","type","small number of lymphocytes","complex immune status","biotin complex","\u03B3-motility","\u03B3-globulins","increasing percentage of CD8","periphery","simultaneous analysis of body fluids","ABC","method","CD3","globulin ratio","antibodies","neutrophils","neutrophilic leukocytosis","feline infectious peritonitis","Abstract Haematology","conclusion","activated state","presence","proteins","avidin","intercellular necrosis","Seropositive animals","neoformed vessels","increased \u03B12","electrophoretic pattern","fractions","histological aspect","distribution","lymphopenia","eosinopenia","hypoalbuminemia","hyperglobulinemia","Immunohistochemical findings","hypersensitivity","Hypergammaglobulinemia"],"language":"en"},

Many CoV proteins are modified by PTMs, including glycosylation and palmitoylation of the spike and envelope protein, N- or O-linked glycosylation of the membrane protein, phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation of the nucleocapsid protein, and other PTMs on nonstructural and accessory proteins. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on PTMs of CoV proteins, with an emphasis on their impact on viral replication and pathogenesis.

A total of 820 sera and 823 nasal swabs from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, buffaloes, mules, and horses were collected. Swabs were tested using RT-PCR and virus RNA-positive samples were genetically sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. Sera were screened using virus microneutralization tests and positive sera (where available) were confirmed using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). We detected 90% PRNT confirmed MERS-CoV antibody in 35 (55.6%) of 63 sera from sheep collected from Senegal, two sheep (1.8%) of 114 in Tunisia and a goat (0.9%) of 107 in Egypt, with titres ranging from 1:80 to \u22651:320.

Specifically, three different expression protocols were compared, differing in their genetic constructs, ie, a simple native histidine-tagged VP6 sequence, VP6 fused to thioredoxin, and VP6 obtained with the newly described small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) fusion system. Our results demonstrate that the histidine-tagged protein does not escape the accumulation in the inclusion bodies, and that SUMO is largely superior to the thioredoxin-fusion tag in enhancing the expression and solubility of VP6 protein. Moreover, the VP6 protein produced according to the SUMO fusion tag displays well-known assembly properties, as observed in both transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images, giving rise to either VP6 trimers, 60 nm spherical virus-like particles, or nanotubes a few microns long. This different quaternary organization of VP6 shows a higher level of immunogenicity for the elongated structures with respect to the spheres or the protein trimers.

Methods We cloned and purified the nucleocapsid protein and spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV and examined their immunogenicity with serum from patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia. An ELISA based on recombinant nucleocapsid protein for IgG detection was tested with serum from 149 healthy blood donors who donated 3 years previously and with serum positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV (by indirect immunofluorescence assay) from 106 patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV was studied with the ELISA in healthy blood donors who donated during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, non-pneumonic hospital inpatients, and symptom-free health-care workers. All positive samples were confirmed by two separate western-blot assays (with recombinant nucleocapsid protein and recombinant spike polypeptide). Findings Western-blot analysis showed that the nucleocapsid protein and spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV are highly immunogenic. The specificity of the IgG antibody test (ELISA with positive samples confirmed by the two western-blot assays) was 100%, and the sensitivity was 94\u00B73%.

In the Middle East and Arab countries, the burden of RSV-associated hospitalizations is not well characterized. We sought to determine the burden and clinical/epidemiological characteristics of RSV hospitalization in young children in Amman, Jordan. We investigated risk factors for severity including vitamin D levels. Methods We conducted viral surveillance with clinical and demographic data in children \u003C2 years admitted with respiratory symptoms and/or fever at the Al-Bashir Government Hospital from March16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Nasal/throat swabs were obtained and placed into lysis buffer, and frozen at \u221280\u00B0C until testing by real-time RT-PCR for 11 respiratory viruses. Heel stick blood or sera samples for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were obtained and sent to a central laboratory for mass spectrometry. Results Of the 3168 children, \u003E80% testing positive for one virus, with RSV the most common virus detected (44%). The RSV-associated hospitalization rate was highest in children \u003C6 months with an annual range of 21.1\u201325.9 per 1000, compared to 6.0\u20138.0 in 6\u201311-month-olds and 1.6\u20132.5 in 12\u201323-month-olds. RSV-positive children compared with RSV-negative were more likely to be previously healthy without underlying medical conditions, less likely to be born prematurely, had a higher frequency of supplemental oxygen use, and had lower median vitamin D levels. Risk factors for oxygen use in RSV-positive children included underlying medical conditions, lack of breastfeeding, younger age, and higher viral load. Conclusion RSV is a major cause of illness in hospitalized Jordanian children and is associated with increased severity compared to other respiratory viruses. Children with RSV in the Middle East would benefit from future RSV vaccines and antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2015-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Halasa, Natasha; Williams, John; Faouri, Samir; Shehabi, Asem; Vermund, Sten H.; Wang, Li; Fonnesbeck, Christopher; Khuri-Bulos, Najwa","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/140c32554663e4033d23a392bd287b0239bfe1d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115487.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15011755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26314623/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X15011755; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.08.048","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","Al-Bashir Government Hospital"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["RSV-positive children","burden of RSV","RSV-negative","Conclusion RSV","young children","future RSV vaccines","RSV-associated hospitalization rate","epidemiological characteristics of RSV hospitalization","hospitalized Jordanian children","respiratory viruses","testing positive","hydroxyvitamin D","respiratory symptoms","Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus","lower median vitamin D levels","viral pneumonia","viral surveillance","higher viral load","underlying medical conditions","Middle East","risk factors","common virus","associated hospitalizations","month-olds","higher frequency of supplemental oxygen use","increased severity","major cause of illness","leading cause of bronchiolitis","lack of breastfeeding","younger age","sera samples","demographic data","real-time RT-PCR","fever","years","infants","Al-Bashir Government Hospital","Arab countries","Amman","March16","Heel stick blood","months","antiviral therapy","OH","central laboratory","mass spectrometry","Methods","throat swabs","lysis buffer","annual range","Nasal","Results"],"language":"en"},

However, molecular techniques are constantly evolving, and they allow a rapid diagnosis for an increasing number of pathogens, with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, they are also able to detect virulence factors or resistance mechanisms. Syndromic surveillance systems, which detect different pathogens simultaneously, are very promising because they enable the most frequent pathogens to be diagnosed in a few hours and they can be very useful in certain patients.

The elaboration was based on the international influenza surveillance system consisting of Sentinel and non-Sentinel programs, recently adopted by Poland, in which professionals engaged in health care had reported tens of thousands of cases of acute upper airway infections. The reporting was followed by the provision of biological specimens collected from patients with suspected influenza and influenza-like infection, in which the causative contagion was then verified with molecular methods. The peak incidence of influenza infections has regularly been in January\u2013March each epidemic season. The number of tested specimens ranged from 2066 to 8367 per season from 2008/2009 to 2017/2018. Type A virus predominated in nine out of the ten seasons and type B virus of the Yamagata lineage in the 2017/2018 season. Concerning the influenza-like infection, respiratory syncytial virus predominated in all the seasons. There was a sharp increase in the proportion of laboratory confirmations of influenza infection from season to season in relation to the number of specimens examined, from 3.2% to 42.4% over the decade. The number of confirmations, enabling a prompt commencement of antiviral treatment, related to the number of specimens collected from patients and on the virological situation in a given season. Yet influenza remains a health scourge, with a dismally low yearly vaccination rate, which recently reaches just about 3.5% of the general population in Poland.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Byambasuren, Sainjargal; Paradowska-Stankiewicz, Iwona; Brydak, Lidia B.","journal":"Trends in Biomedical Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/532399b986626c440d1915201b5e27dd7f96bac2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121751.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/5584_2019_462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989546/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Poland"],"keyphrases":["suspected influenza","number of specimens","virological characteristics of influenza seasons","given season","epidemic season","proportion of laboratory confirmations of influenza infection","peak incidence of influenza infections","Poland","number of confirmations","number of tested specimens","international influenza surveillance system","patients","type B virus","provision of biological specimens","respiratory syncytial virus","virological situation","health care","health scourge","past decade","non-Sentinel programs","cases of acute upper airway infections","tens of thousands","Yamagata lineage","relation","prompt commencement of antiviral treatment","changes","low yearly vaccination rate","sharp increase","causative contagion","professionals","molecular methods","review","general population","elaboration","objective","reporting"],"language":"en"},

Both scenarios could endanger life and safety of the buildings occupants. Equipping buildings with appropriate chemical sensors can alert the building occupants about the contaminant release. The readings of these sensors can be employed to trace the location of release, and help to take the appropriate actions to minimize the casualties. However, only a limited number of them can be installed due to their initial and operating cost. Moreover, there is no information about the source strength, release time and possible source location. This paper reports the development of a methodology to identify the source location using sensors reading from limited locations. The methodology uses the artificial neural network (ANN) as a statistical analysis integrated with a multi-zone airborne contaminant transport model, CONTAM. To evaluate the applicability of this method, the contaminant dispersion within a building was modeled and the results were integrated to an ANN for the source identification. The prediction made by the trained ANN was then evaluated by predicting the source of the contaminant in 40 extra cases, which had not been seen by the network during the training session. The model was able to predict the source location in more than 90% of the cases when the building was monitored by three or more sensors. The results show that the method can be used to help building designers decide the optimum configuration of the sensors required for a space based on the accuracy level of the source detection.","publish_time":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bastani, Arash; Haghighat, Fariborz; Kozinski, Janusz A.","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77b8b1cedc9dc139d832e44ea7bf8bd7da7d34b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127283.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132311004185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288021/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132311004185; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.12.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contaminant release","source strength","location of release","possible source location","source detection","source identification","building occupants","appropriate chemical sensors","release time","contaminant dispersion","accidental release of chemical agents","buildings occupants","methodology","trained ANN","results","multi-zone airborne contaminant transport model","Equipping buildings","accuracy level","appropriate actions","level of protection","limited locations","limited number","extra cases","artificial neural network","statistical analysis","life","safety","optimum configuration","space","information","operating cost","designers","scenarios","training session","paper","development","casualties","prediction","applicability","readings"],"language":"en"},

The structural and functional genomics approaches have now pinpointed the technical challenge in the exploration of disease-related genes and the recognition of their structural alterations or elucidation of gene function. Various promising technologies and diagnostic applications of structural genomics are currently preparing a large database of disease-genes, genetic alterations etc., by mutation scanning and DNA chip technology. Further the functional genomics also exploring the expression genetics (hybridization-, PCR- and sequence-based technologies), two-hybrid technology, next generation sequencing with Bioinformatics and computational biology. Advances in microarray \u201Cchip\u201D technology as microarrays have allowed the parallel analysis of gene expression patterns of thousands of genes simultaneously. Sequence information collected from the genomes of many individuals is leading to the rapid discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. Further advances of genetic engineering have also revolutionized immunoassay biotechnology via engineering of antibody-encoding genes and the phage display technology. The Biotechnology plays an important role in the development of diagnostic assays in response to an outbreak or critical disease response need. However, there is also need to pinpoint various obstacles and issues related to the commercialization and widespread dispersal of genetic knowledge derived from the exploitation of the biotechnology industry and the development and marketing of diagnostic services. Implementation of genetic criteria for patient selection and individual assessment of the risks and benefits of treatment emerges as a major challenge to the pharmaceutical industry.

While most politicians understand that climate action is absolutely necessary, any significant action is stalled by a number of important barriers they have to overcome. Using clinical analogies from eating disorders and the scientific literature on motivational change, this paper analyses three current strategies that push for political action. First, using force and emotions (like confronting activists) is equivalent to playing a power struggle, which risks increasing politicians\u0027 resistance to change. Second, collaborative discussions in multilateral conferences and debates risk feeding verbal manifestos without enacting behavioural change. Withdrawal from the manifestos of politicians is a third strategy to push for change discussed in this paper. However, even after bypassing manifestos, this strategy is unlikely to succeed because the benefits of greenhouse gas emissions, linked to our current social norms, seriously outweigh the benefits of climate action. Overall, all three methods present severe flaws and are not viable solutions to help politicians implement climate action. Other enhanced options are likely to be necessary.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"BARBALAT, Dr. Guillaume","journal":"Energy Res Soc Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a468947a00823821c3b39eb71218784379a65d77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151433.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292706/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101547; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620301237?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214629620301237","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["climate change","benefits of climate action","significant action","lack of political action","motivational change","behavioural change","manifestos of politicians","verbal manifestos","strategy","current strategies","paper analyses","current social norms","benefits of greenhouse gas emissions","debates risk","multilateral conferences","viable solutions","ambivalence","disorders","scientific literature","psychiatric lens","collaborative discussions","methods present severe flaws","confronting activists","frames","power struggle","qualitative study","force","emotions","enhanced options","number of important barriers","politicians\u0027 resistance","core of inaction","clinical analogies","Withdrawal"],"language":"en"},

The immune responses underlying alphavirus virulence remain enigmatic. We found that pentraxin 3 (PTX3) was highly expressed in CHIKV and RRV patients during acute disease. Overt expression of PTX3 in CHIKV patients was associated with increased viral load and disease severity. PTX3-deficient (PTX3(-/-)) mice acutely infected with RRV exhibited delayed disease progression and rapid recovery through diminished inflammatory responses and viral replication.

Since the 3a protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi compartment, its role in causing ER stress was investigated in transiently transfected cells. Cells expressing the 3a proteins showed ER stress based on activation of genes for the ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94. Since ER stress can cause differential modulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which includes the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathways, these were individually tested in 3a-expressing cells. Only the PERK pathway was found to be activated in 3a-expressing cells based on (1) increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03B1) and inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative form of eIF2\u03B1 on GRP78 promoter activity, (2) increased translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) mRNA, and (3) ATF4-dependent activation of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) gene promoter. Activation of PERK affects innate immunity by suppression of type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling. The 3a protein was found to induce serine phosphorylation within the IFN alpha-receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) degradation motif and to increase IFNAR1 ubiquitination. Confocal microscopic analysis showed increased translocation of IFNAR1 into the lysosomal compartment and flow cytometry showed reduced levels of IFNAR1 in 3a-expressing cells. These results provide further mechanistic details of the pro-apoptotic effects of the SARS-CoV 3a protein, and suggest a potential role for it in attenuating interferon responses and innate immunity.","publish_time":"2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Minakshi, Rinki; Padhan, Kartika; Rani, Manjusha; Khan, Nabab; Ahmad, Faizan; Jameel, Shahid","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf6c6fa2a4cf3fd624d4ef8291804a3fab3f1b2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2791231.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20020050/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008342","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER stress","ER kinase","accessory protein","transfected cells","ER chaperones GRP78","Activation of PERK","EBP homologous protein","unfolded protein response","increased translocation of IFNAR1","apoptosis of infected cells","IFNAR1 ubiquitination","reduced levels of IFNAR1","SARS-CoV","activation of genes","pro-apoptotic effects","innate immunity","ATF4-dependent activation","proteins","translation of activating transcription factor","PERK pathway","phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor","GRP78 promoter activity","lysosomal compartment","inhibitory effects","Golgi compartment","gene promoter","serine phosphorylation","potential role","IFN alpha-receptor subunit","attenuating interferon responses","dominant-negative form of eIF2\u03B1","flow cytometry","CHOP","differential modulation","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","degradation motif","suppression of type","mechanistic details","PKR","Confocal microscopic analysis","endoplasmic reticulum","UPR","mRNA","ATF6","inositol","IRE","GRP94","pathways","enzyme","results"],"language":"en"},

IFN stimulates an association between PLZF, the promyelocytic leukemia protein and histone deacetylase 1, to induce a decisive subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consequently, PLZF-deficient mice have a specific ISG defect and as a result are more susceptible to viral infection. This susceptibility correlates with a marked decrease in the expression of the key antiviral mediators and an impaired IFN-mediated induction of natural killer cell function.

Prime-only as well as prime-boost vaccination resulted in uniform protection against a lethal challenge with NiV Bangladesh: all animals survived challenge and we were unable to find infectious virus either in oral swabs, lung or brain tissue. Furthermore, no pathological lung damage was observed. A single-dose of ChAdOx1 NiV(B) also prevented disease and lethality from heterologous challenge with NiV Malaysia. While we were unable to detect infectious virus in swabs or tissue of animals challenged with the heterologous strain, a very limited amount of viral RNA could be found in lung tissue by in situ hybridization. A single dose of ChAdOx1 NiV(B) also provided partial protection against Hendra virus and passive transfer of antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1 NiV(B) vaccination partially protected Syrian hamsters against NiV Bangladesh.

Using as model BPLF1, the homologue encoded by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), we found that induction of the productive virus cycle does not affect the total level of ubiquitin-conjugation but is accompanied by a BPLF1-dependent decrease of NEDD8-adducts and accumulation of free NEDD8. Expression of BPLF1 promotes cullin degradation and the stabilization of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) substrates in the nucleus, while cytoplasmic CRLs and their substrates are not affected. The inactivation of nuclear CRLs is reversed by the N-terminus of CAND1, which inhibits the binding of BPLF1 to cullins and prevents efficient viral DNA replication. Targeting of the deneddylase activity to the nucleus is dependent on processing of the catalytic N-terminus by caspase-1. Inhibition of caspase-1 severely impairs viral DNA synthesis and the release of infectious virus, pointing a previously unrecognized role of the cellular response to danger signals triggered by EBV reactivation in promoting virus replication.","publish_time":"2013-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gastaldello, Stefano; Chen, Xinsong; Callegari, Simone; Masucci, Maria G.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdb16338832867fb4c294b2694e8e23da78f3597.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3795028.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24130483/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus replication","BPLF1-dependent decrease of NEDD8","binding of BPLF1","Expression of BPLF1","model BPLF1","release of infectious virus","Epstein-Barr virus","productive virus cycle","catalytic N-terminus","efficient viral DNA replication","nucleus","cytoplasmic CRLs","substrates","viral DNA synthesis","accumulation of free NEDD8","inactivation of nuclear CRLs","potent ubiquitin","N-terminal cysteine proteases","stabilization of cullin","cullin degradation","NEDD8-specific deconjugase activities","EBV reactivation","Inhibition of caspase","total level of ubiquitin","function","cullins","cellular response","danger signals","large tegument proteins of herpesviruses","unrecognized role","RING ligases","homologue","processing","conjugation","induction","enzymes","deneddylase activity","CAND1"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The search function of Twitter (TW) and Instagram (IG) was used to generate a list of accounts with the terms: fertility, infertility, ttc, egg freezing, ivf, endometriosis, and reproductive. Accounts not in English, in private, with no posts in \u003E 1 year, or with content unrelated to search terms were excluded. Accounts were assessed for author type; REI board certification (REI-BC); influencer (INF) status (\u003E 10 K followers on IG; verified check mark on TW); account demographics; and content in last 5 posts. Statistical analysis included unpaired t tests, a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, and stepwise multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Seven hundred ten accounts were identified and 537 (278 TW, 259 IG) were included. Account types included societies, clinics, physicians, patients, groups, and \u201Cother.\u201D Instagram content (1290 posts reviewed) was primarily personal stories (31.7%) or inspiration/support (23.7%). Twitter content (1390 posts reviewed) was mostly promotion (28.2%) and research/education (20.2%). Thirty-nine accounts (12.5%) were influencers. Fertility influencers were most often awareness/support accounts (59.8% TW, 25.0% IG), patients (12.8% TW, 25% IG), or other (17.9% TW, 21.0% IG). Only 7.7% TW and 7.1% IG INFs were board-certified REI physicians. The best predictor for classification as an influencer was high activity (\u003E 50 posts/month TW, \u003E 10 posts/month IG). CONCLUSION: As patients increasingly utilize social media to obtain and engage with health information, it is critical to understand the fertility-related SM landscape. This understanding may help to successfully enhance relationships with patients and ensure dissemination of accurate information.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blakemore, Jennifer K.; Bayer, Arielle H.; Smith, Meghan B.; Grifo, James A.","journal":"J Assist Reprod Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2e8cfe514d3f701681014db69d41c233038001c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205373.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-020-01799-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382959/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Instagram","IG","REI","TW","SM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["posts","month TW","month IG","support accounts","IG INFs","patients","list of accounts","fertility-related social media accounts","Fertility influencers","Twitter content","Instagram content","content unrelated","social media platforms","classification","REI-BC","board-certified REI physicians","fertility-related SM landscape","terms","REI board certification","search function of Twitter","Statistical analysis","regression tree","Account types","account demographics","health information","dissemination of accurate information","stepwise multiple logistic regression","unpaired t tests","ttc","CART","clinics","verified check mark","egg freezing","author type","ivf","followers","infertility","societies","high activity","endometriosis","awareness","status","relationships","METHODS","best predictor","groups","year","personal stories","research","inspiration","promotion","English","PURPOSE","CONCLUSION","education","understanding","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, while much has been written regarding China-Africa aid overall, relatively little attention has been given to China\u2019s health aid. To better understand these investments, we provide an overview of the current framework and characteristics of China\u2019s health aid to Africa. China\u2019s health assistance has been perceived by some as opportunistic, largely as a demonstration of China\u2019s engagement in \u201Csoft power\u201D and an attempt to enhance its access to natural resources and political favors by African countries. Others have attributed altruistic intent, aiming to support the advancement of the health of populations in the African continent with a \u201Cno strings attached\u201D approach. Our overview demonstrated that despite the magnitude of China\u2019s health assistance, many questions remain regarding the scope of this aid, its effectiveness and the governance mechanisms that guide the conceptualization and implementation of such efforts. We also identified the need for a systematic and rigorous evaluation of the various elements of China\u2019s health assistance to African countries in order to gain a deeper understanding of how priorities and allocations for health aid are determined, how such aid fits within the specific African country\u2019s health strategies and to assess the effectiveness of such aid. Insights garnered through such an assessment could help determine future priorities for investment as well as inform efforts to optimize the value of China\u0027s aid for the populations of the recipient countries.","publish_time":"2016-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Shuang; Gao, Liangmin; Reyes, Melissa; Cheng, Feng; Kaufman, Joan; El-Sadr, Wafaa M.","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48c1c1a52958c6fd6f18ff10121c1336b9eb1395.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5135833.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-016-0217-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27912773/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","China"],"keyphrases":["characteristics of China\u2019s health aid","health of populations","magnitude of China\u2019s health assistance","aid fits","China-Africa aid","various elements of China\u2019s health assistance","substantial health commitments","African countries","value of China\u0027s aid","specific African country\u2019s health strategies","demonstration of China\u2019s engagement","African continent","recipient countries","effectiveness","efforts","overview","future priorities","natural resources","political favors","order","rigorous evaluation","current framework","access","allocations","deeper understanding","soft power","little attention","attempt","conceptualization","governance mechanisms","past","questions","need","assessment","implementation","strings","scope","advancement","decades","altruistic intent","Insights","approach","investments"],"language":"en"},

In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV plus two closely related bat strains (SARS\u2010like CoV) available in GenBank. Bayesian time\u2010scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that 2019\u20102020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25 November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy, and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giovanetti, Marta; Benvenuto, Domenico; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0345bb885e850845164b45ae6a2cfefe83335b51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166327.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32022275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Europe"],"keyphrases":["Italy","China","nCoV epidemic","epidemic transmission","Europe","Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction","evaluation of transmission dynamics","Coronavirus Italian cases","Viral genome phylogenetic analysis","evidence of likely imported cases","ongoing epidemic","related bat strains","countries","spread","Wuhan","couple of Chinese tourists","useful tool","genome sequences","short report","Bayesian time","novel Coronavirus","recent evidence of infection","Rome","SARS","human mobility","quarantine of suspected","preventive action","maximum clade credibility tree","dataset","causal pathogen","GenBank","introduction","BEAST","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection has only recently been investigated. Expression of chemokines is induced by infection with laboratory-adapted, but not street, rabies viruses (RABVs), and it has been hypothesized that expression of chemokines is one of the mechanisms by which RABV is attenuated. To further define the role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection, chemokine genes such as MIP-1\u03B1, RANTES, IP-10, and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) have been cloned into RABV genome. It has been found that recombinant RABVs expressing RANTES or IP-10 induce high and persistent expression of these chemokines, resulting in massive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS) and development of diseases and death in the mouse model. However, recombinant RABVs expressing MIP-1\u03B1, MDC, as well as GM-CSF further attenuate RABV by inducing a transient expression of chemokines, infiltration of inflammatory cells, enhancement of blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Yet, these recombinant RABVs show increased adaptive immune responses by recruiting/activating dendritic cells, T and B cells in the periphery as well as in the CNS. Further, direct administration of these recombinant RABVs into the CNS can prevent mice from developing rabies days after infection with street RABV. All these studies together suggest that chemokines are both protective and pathogenic in RABV infections. Those with protective roles could be exploited for development of future RABV vaccines or therapeutic agents.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niu, Xuefeng; Wang, Hualei; Fu, Zhen F.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e1ba60f4c653e334a28e82d31efb9424f61eace.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150196.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-387040-7.00005-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21601043/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123870407000056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123870407000056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RABV","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of chemokines","recombinant RABVs","Abstract Chemokines","transient expression of chemokines","street RABV","attenuate RABV","RABV infections","RABV genome","dendritic cells","B cells","rabies pathogenesis","CNS","massive infiltration of inflammatory cells","rabies viruses","development of future RABV vaccines","persistent expression","types of nucleated cells","developing rabies days","MIP","protection","MDC","RANTES","development of diseases","chemokine genes","protective roles","macrophage-derived chemokine","recruiting","increased adaptive immune responses","mediate leukocyte activation","enhancement of blood","central nervous system","mice","brain barrier","therapeutic agents","BBB","death","family","periphery","chemotactic activities","GM-CSF","mouse model","permeability","direct administration","laboratory","related proteins","mechanisms","studies"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of this new virus in human beings. METHODS: We obtained ex-vivo cultures of the human bronchus, lung, nasopharynx, and tonsil and in-vitro cultures of primary human alveolar epithelial cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. We compared virus tropism and induction of proinflammatory cytokine responses of two human influenza A H7N9 virus isolates, A/Shanghai/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/2/2013; a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus; the highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N7 virus that infected human beings in the Netherlands in 2003; the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 virus, and a low pathogenic duck H7N9 virus that was genetically different to the human disease causing A H7N9 viruses. FINDINGS: Both human H7N9 viruses replicated efficiently in human bronchus and lung ex-vivo cultures, whereas duck/H7N9 virus failed to replicate in either. Both human A H7N9 viruses infected both ciliated and non-ciliated human bronchial epithelial cells and replicated to higher titres than did H5N1 (p\u003C0\u00B70001 to 0\u00B70046) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 replicated to higher titres than did H7N7 (p=0\u00B70002\u20130\u00B701). Both human A H7N9 viruses predominantly infected type II alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in the human lung and replicated to higher titres than did H5N1 (p\u003C0\u00B70001 to 0\u00B70078); A/Shanghai/1/2013 replicated to higher titres than did H1N1 (p=0\u00B70052\u20130\u00B705) and H7N7 (p=0\u00B70031\u20130\u00B70151). Human H7N9 viruses were less potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines compared with H5N1 virus. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, the results suggest that the novel H7N9 viruses are better adapted to infect and replicate in the human conducting and lower airways than are other avian influenza viruses, including H5N1, and pose an important pandemic threat.

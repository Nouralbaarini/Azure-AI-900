By using intravenous or topical fluorescent agents, CLE highlights certain mucosal elements that facilitate an optical biopsy in real time. CLE technology has been used in different organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract. There has been numerous studies evaluating this technology in gastrointestinal endoscopy, our aim was to evaluate the safety, value, and efficacy of this technology in the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Technology and Value Assessment Committee (TAVAC) performed a PubMed/Medline database search of clinical studies involving CLE in May of 2018. The literature search used combinations of the keywords: confocal laser endomicroscopy, pCLE, Cellvizio, in vivo microscopy, optical histology, advanced endoscopic imaging, and optical diagnosis. Bibliographies of key references were searched for relevant studies not covered by the PubMed search. Case reports and small case series were excluded. The manufacturer\u0027s website was also used to identify key references. The United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) Manufacturer And User facility and Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for reports regarding the device malfunction or injuries. RESULTS The technology offers an excellent safety profile with rare adverse events related to the use of fluorescent agents. It has been shown to increase the detection of dysplastic Barrett\u0027s esophagus, gastric intraepithelial neoplasia/early gastric cancer, and dysplasia associated with inflammatory bowel disease when compared to standard screening protocols. It also aids in the differentiation and classification of colorectal polyps, indeterminate biliary strictures, and pancreatic cystic lesions. CONCLUSIONS CLE has an excellent safety profile. CLE can increase the diagnostic accuracy in a number of gastrointestinal pathologies.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Mansour, Mazen R; Caycedo-Marulanda, Antonio; Davis, Brian R; Alawashez, Abdulrahim; Docimo, Salvatore; Qureshi, Alia; Tsuda, Shawn","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07607-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405892/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Barrett"],"organizations":["CLE","Value Assessment Committee","United States Food and Drug Administration","FDA","CONCLUSIONS CLE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CLE technology","CONCLUSIONS CLE","gastrointestinal tract","gastrointestinal endoscopy","PubMed search","Society of American Gastrointestinal","excellent safety profile","number of gastrointestinal pathologies","CLE highlights certain mucosal elements","Endoscopic Surgeons","optical histology","optical biopsy","optical diagnosis","Medline database search of clinical studies","relevant studies","Case reports","numerous studies","literature search","BACKGROUND Confocal laser endomicroscopy","advanced endoscopic imaging","novel endoscopic adjunct","topical fluorescent agents","use of fluorescent agents","Bibliographies of key references","gastric cancer","Device Experience","device malfunction","gastric intraepithelial neoplasia","Value Assessment Committee","small case series","histological examination of mucosal surfaces","SAGES","indeterminate biliary strictures","keywords","Cellvizio","rare adverse events","Drug Administration","FDA","User facility","MAUDE","pCLE","TAVAC","classification of colorectal polyps","detection of dysplastic Barrett\u0027s esophagus","inflammatory bowel disease","dysplasia","combinations","different organ systems","pancreatic cystic lesions","United States Food","diagnostic accuracy","standard screening protocols","aim","efficacy","differentiation","real time","injuries","METHODS","manufacturer\u0027s website"],"language":"en"},

The TT are composed of TT cells with dark secretory granules and proacinar cells with lighter secretory granules, the latter being considered the immediate precursor of mature acinar cells. TT cells contain a specific secretory protein, submandibular gland protein C (SMGC) and they decrease in number postnatally at a higher rate in males than in females. In the present study, in order to clarify the biological roles of TT cells and their secretory product SMGC, we generated a knockout (KO) mouse strain deficient in SMGC. The KO mice of both sexes grew normally, had normal reproductive capacity and had normal acinar and duct systems in the SMG in adult ages. However, through the neonatal and early postnatal stages, the KO mice were deficient not only in the production of SMGC but also in TT cells. With electron microscopy of the SMG of newborn KO mice, TT cells with characteristic granules were absent and replaced by undifferentiated ductal cells, whereas proacinar cells were normal. These results suggested that the absence of SMGC inhibits the development of TT cells and that the absence of SMGC and TT cells has no notable influence on the postnatal development of the acinar and duct systems in the SMG.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakata, Hiroki; Terakawa, Jumpei; Horike, Shin-Ichi; Daikoku, Takiko; Iseki, Shoichi","journal":"Cell and tissue research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03205-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418130/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":["TT","SMG","SMGC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of TT cells","proacinar cells","biological roles of TT cells","undifferentiated ductal cells","absence of SMGC","secretory product SMGC","immediate precursor of mature acinar cells","SMG of newborn KO mice","production of SMGC","newborn mice","lighter secretory granules","dark secretory granules","specific secretory protein","characteristic granules","duct systems","postnatal development","mature acini","submandibular gland protein C","normal reproductive capacity","rudiments of acini","early postnatal stages","mouse strain deficient","knockout","notable influence","higher rate","order","terminal tubules","sexes","adult ages","electron microscopy","females","number","present study","results"],"language":"en"},

We investigated an association between delay in radical prostatectomy (RP) and oncological outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective review of men with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer (PC) in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) underdoing radical prostatectomy from 2010-2016. Immediate RP was defined as RP within 3-months of diagnosis, while delayed RP was analyzed in 3-month intervals up to 12-months. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed RP and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on RP, node positive disease, and post-RP secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate RP. RESULTS We identified 128,062 men with intermediate- and high-risk PC treated with RP. After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease, or post-RP secondary treatments between men treated with immediate RP and any level of delay up to 12 months. Subgroup analysis of men with Grade group 4 and 5 PC did not demonstrate an association between delayed RP and worse oncological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In the NCDB, delayed RP was not associated with early adverse oncological outcomes at RP. These results may provide reassurance to patients and urologists balancing care in the current pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ginsburg, Kevin B; Curtis, Gannon L; Timar, Ryan E; George, Arvin K; Cher, Michael L","journal":"The Journal of urology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/ju.0000000000001089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Cancer Database"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Immediate RP","levels of delayed RP","post-RP secondary treatments","early adverse oncological outcomes","worse oncological outcomes","high-risk PC","retrospective review of men","Subgroup analysis of men","node positive disease","odds of adverse pathology","radical prostatectomy","elective oncological surgeries","NCDB","months of diagnosis","results","high-risk prostate cancer","current pandemic","emergent patient care","National Cancer Database","efforts","resources","urologists","Grade group","COVID","healthcare organizations","reassurance","patients","significant difference","associations","Novel Coronavirus","Multivariable logistic regression models","PURPOSE","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","month intervals","MATERIALS","adjustment"],"language":"en"},

This review aims to re-analyze and summarize the current research findings in a timely manner to guide scholars in relevant fields to further SARS-CoV-2 research and assist healthcare professionals in their work and decision-making. The SARS-CoV-2 related terms were selected in both English and Chinese and were searched in several major databases, including Pubmed, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases. The reference list of each search result was screened for relevance, which was further supplemented to the search results. The included studies were categorized by topics with key characteristics extracted, re-analyzed, and summarized. A total of 301 articles were finally included with 136 in Chinese and 165 in English. The number of publications has rapidly increased since mid-January, 2020, and a peak day was 6th February on which 50 articles were published. The top three countries publishing articles were China, the United States and the United Kingdom. The Lancet and its specialty journals have published the most articles, with contribution also from journals such as New England Journal of Medicine ( NEJM), The Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA), and Nature.

Their incidence increases with age, and males are more often affected. First-line management includes maximum safe surgical resection followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and six cycles of maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy. Standards of care at recurrence are much less well defined. Minorities of patients are offered second surgery or re-irradiation, but data on a positive impact on survival from randomized trials are lacking. The majority of patients who are eligible for salvage therapy receive systemic treatment, mostly with nitrosourea-based regimens or, depending on availability, bevacizumab alone or in various combinations. In clinical trials, lomustine alone has been increasingly used as a control arm, assigning this drug a standard-of-care position in the setting of recurrent glioblastoma. Here we review the activity of lomustine in the treatment of diffuse gliomas of adulthood in various settings. The most compelling data for lomustine stem from three randomized trials when lomustine was combined with procarbazine and vincristine as the PCV regimen in the newly diagnosed setting together with radiotherapy; improved survival with PCV was restricted to patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant tumors. No other agent with the possible exception of regorafenib has shown superior activity to lomustine in recurrent glioblastoma, but activity is largely restricted to patients with tumors with O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation.

Often the legally authorized representative is not on site. Remote consent procedures in the US are inconsistent with the majority of sites shunning these approaches. The current pandemic with visitor restrictions highlights the need for enhancing these options. METHODS Remote electronic and phone consent procedures specifically for endovascular stroke trials from two comprehensive stroke centers (CSC) are presented. An overview of the genesis of informed consent procedures in the US is also included. RESULTS The two CSCs identified as Institution-1 and Institution-2 are large tertiary systems. Institution-1 is a non-profit university-affiliated academic medical center in rural geography. Institution-2 is an HCA hospital in an urban environment. Both serve patients through a spoke-and-hub network, have participated in multiple randomized endovascular stroke trials, and have successfully used these remote options for enrollment. A tiered approach is employed at both institutions with an emphasis on obtaining informed consent in person and resorting to alternatives methods when efforts to that are unsuccessful. A rationale for electronic and phone consent is included, followed by step-by-step illustration of the process at each institution. CONCLUSION Two examples of remote electronic or phone consent procedures from institutions in different geographic environments and organization structures demonstrate that these options can be successfully used for enrollment in stroke trials. The current pandemic highlights the need to enhance these approaches while maintaining appropriate adherence to ethical and legal frameworks.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rai, Ansaar T; Frei, Donald","journal":"Journal of neurointerventional surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Remote consent procedures","phone consent procedures","genesis of informed consent procedures","remote options","METHODS Remote electronic","time-sensitive endovascular stroke trials","multiple randomized endovascular stroke trials","examples of remote electronic","comprehensive stroke centers","institutions","need","BACKGROUND Enrollment","approaches","current pandemic","alternatives methods","different geographic environments","non-profit university-affiliated academic medical center","organization structures","rural geography","appropriate adherence","person","legal frameworks","HCA hospital","visitor restrictions","emphasis","hub network","majority of sites","spoke","urban environment","efforts","inability","large tertiary systems","process","step-by-step illustration","overview","CONCLUSION","rationale","authorized representative","debilitated patient","tiered approach","patients","CSCs"],"language":"en"},

This review sought to identify interventions used to facilitate patient and/or family engagement among adults with MCC. METHODS We adhered as closely as possible to PRISMA guidelines and conducted a systematic scoping review using a modified approach by Arksey and O\u0027Malley. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using terms related to MCC, patient and family engagement, and intervention. We included articles that: (1) were published in English; (2) were peer-reviewed; (3) described an engagement intervention (with or without a comparator); and (4) targeted individuals with MCC. We abstracted data from included articles and classified them using the Multidimensional Framework for Patient and Family Engagement in Health and Health Care, and the Classification Model of Patient Engagement. RESULTS We identified 21 discrete interventions. Six (29%) were classified as having the highest degree of engagement. Eighteen (85%) focused on engagement at the direct care level.

The goal of this study was to assess the diagnostic values of different methods of detecting and estimating the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the auxiliary diagnostic potential of antibody assays. By retrospectively analyzing the data of viral RNAs and serum IgM-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from 38 cases with confirmed COVID-19 in the Second People\u0027s Hospital of Fuyang, we found that, in the early phase of the illness, the viral RNA was most abundant in the sputum specimens, followed by that in the throat swabs, while the antibody assays identified fewer positive cases at this stage. However, the sensitivity of the antibody assays overtook that of RNA test from eighth day of disease onset. Simultaneous use of antibody assay and RT-qPCR improved the sensitivity of the diagnoses. Moreover, we found that most of these cases with no detectable viral RNA load during the early stages were able to be seropositive after 7 days.

Fever and cough were the most common symptoms of both diseases, while myalgia and diarrhea were less common in patients with COVID-19. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most severe pulmonary complication that caused high mortality rate. Histologically, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was the most characteristic finding in non-survivors with either SARS or COVID-19. Cases of patients died less than 10~14 days of disease duration demonstrated acute-phase DAD, while cases beyond 10~14 days of disease duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD in SARS. Meanwhile, organization and fibrosis were usually accompanied by exudation. Coronavirus was mostly detected in pneumocytes, while less in macrophages and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Hemorrhagic necrosis and lymphocytes depletion were found in lymph nodes and spleen in both SARS and COVID-19, indicating a pathological basis of lymphocytopenia. Thrombosis was commonly observed in small vessels and microvascular in lungs accompanying DAD. Microthrombosis was also found in extrapulmonary organs in COVID-19, that was less reported in SARS. Damages in multiple extrapulmonary organs were observed, but coronavirus was not detected in some of those organs, might indicating an alternative mechanism beyond viral infection, such as hypoxemia, ischemia and cytokine storm induced immunological injury. Diffuse alveolar damage due to viral infection and immunological injury, as well as multi-organ dysfunction and extensive microthrombus formation, brought huge challenge to the management of patients with severe SARS or COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, T; Sun, L X; Feng, R E","journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200311-00312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241072/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Microthrombosis"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","severe SARS","acute-phase DAD","coronavirus disease","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","Cases of patients","days of disease duration","viral infection","immunological injury","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","management of patients","diffuse alveolar damage","multiple extrapulmonary organs","severe pulmonary complication","common symptoms","pathological features","pathological basis of lymphocytopenia","extensive microthrombus formation","multi-organ dysfunction","huge challenge","ischemia","ARDS","lymphocytes depletion","cytokine storm","hypoxemia","lymph nodes","similar pathogenetic","non-survivors","high mortality rate","small vessels","characteristic finding","macrophages","diseases","myalgia","lungs","diarrhea","alternative mechanism","spleen","bronchiolar epithelial cells","Hemorrhagic necrosis","cough","Damages","fibrosis","Fever","pneumocytes","Microthrombosis","organization","exudation"],"language":"en"},

A gold diagnostic standard does not exist. The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in a cohort of revision for AF, using an experimental diagnostic algorithm. METHODS The surgeons\u0027 suspicion of AF was based primarily on patient history and clinical evaluation. X-ray imaging was used to reveal mechanical problems. To rule out an infectious aetiology standard blood biochemical tests were ordered in most patients. Evaluation followed the existing practice in the institute. Cases were included if revision surgery was planned for suspected AF. Intraoperatively, five synovial tissue biopsies were obtained routinely. PJI was defined as \u22653 positive cultures with the same microorganism(s). Patients were followed for 1 year postoperatively. Protocol samples included joint fluid, additional synovial tissue biopsies, bone biopsy, swabs from the implant surface, and sonication of retrieved components. Routine and protocol samples were cultured with extended incubation (14 days) and preserved for batchwise 16S rRNA gene amplification. Patients were stratified based on culture results and a clinical status was obtained at study end. RESULTS A total of 72 revisions were performed on 71 patients (35 THA and 37 TKA). We found five of 72 cases of unrecognized PJI. Extended culture and protocol samples accounted for two of these. One patient diagnosed with AF was treated for a PJI during follow-up. The remaining patients did not change status from AF during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS We found a low prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infections in patients with an AF diagnosis. The algorithm strengthens the surgeons\u0027 preoperative diagnosis of a non-infective condition. Evaluation for a failing TKA or THA is complex. Distinguishing between AF and PJI pre-operatively was a clinical decision. Our data did not support additional testing in routine revision surgery for AF.","publish_time":"2019-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khalid, Vesal; Sch\u00F8nheyder, Henrik Carl; Nielsen, Poul Torben; Kappel, Andreas; Thomsen, Trine Rolighed; Aleksyniene, Ramune; Lorenzen, Jan; Rasmussen, Sten","journal":"BMC musculoskeletal disorders","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-019-2944-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31830947/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AF","PJI","THA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AF diagnosis","suspected AF","surgeons\u0027 suspicion of AF","cases of unrecognized PJI","remaining patients","routine revision surgery","Protocol samples","THA","clinical evaluation","PJI pre-","BACKGROUND Unrecognized periprosthetic joint infections","low prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infections","joint fluid","cohort of revision","clinical status","additional synovial tissue biopsies","clinical decision","Extended culture","failing TKA","culture results","follow-up","surgeons\u0027 preoperative diagnosis","experimental diagnostic algorithm","gold diagnostic standard","additional testing","total hip","extended incubation","current study","study end","patient history","S rRNA gene amplification","infectious aetiology standard blood biochemical tests","concern","bone biopsy","aseptic failure","implant surface","swabs","batchwise","knee","non-infective condition","sonication of retrieved components","microorganism","days","existing practice","positive cultures","METHODS","X-ray imaging","mechanical problems","institute","aim","CONCLUSIONS","data","arthroplasties","revisions","year"],"language":"en"},

As a social media platform with billions of daily views, YouTube has tremendous potential to both support and hinder public health efforts. However, the usefulness and accuracy of most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 have not been investigated. METHODS A YouTube search was performed on 21 March 2020 using keywords \u0027coronavirus\u0027 and \u0027COVID-19\u0027, and the top 75 viewed videos from each search were analysed. Videos that were duplicates, non-English, non-audio and non-visual, exceeding 1 hour in duration, live and unrelated to COVID-19 were excluded. Two reviewers coded the source, content and characteristics of included videos. The primary outcome was usability and reliability of videos, analysed using the novel COVID-19 Specific Score (CSS), modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) and modified JAMA (mJAMA) scores. RESULTS Of 150 videos screened, 69 (46%) were included, totalling 257 804 146 views. Nineteen (27.5%) videos contained non-factual information, totalling 62 042 609 views. Government and professional videos contained only factual information and had higher CSS than consumer videos (mean difference (MD) 2.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.32, p=0.037); mDISCERN scores than consumer videos (MD 2.46, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.42, p=0.008), internet news videos (MD 2.20, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.21, p=0.027) and entertainment news videos (MD 2.57, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.49, p=0.004); and mJAMA scores than entertainment news videos (MD 1.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.36, p=0.033) and consumer videos (MD 1.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.44, p=0.028). However, they only accounted for 11% of videos and 10% of views. CONCLUSION Over one-quarter of the most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 contained misleading information, reaching millions of viewers worldwide. As the current COVID-19 pandemic worsens, public health agencies must better use YouTube to deliver timely and accurate information and to minimise the spread of misinformation. This may play a significant role in successfully managing the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Heidi Oi-Yee; Bailey, Adrian; Huynh, David; Chan, James","journal":"BMJ global health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409327/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YouTube","CSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["consumer videos","viewed videos","reliability of videos","professional videos","viewed YouTube videos","entertainment news videos","internet news videos","characteristics of included videos","novel COVID","current COVID","YouTube search","misleading information","accurate information","pandemic","non-factual information","mJAMA scores","mDISCERN scores","public health agencies","public health efforts","effective dissemination of factual information","billions of daily views","century\u0027s largest public health emergency","higher CSS","non-audio","modified JAMA","successful management","support","mean difference","tremendous potential","content","social media platform","source","hour","duration","usability","Specific Score","duplicates","quarter","accuracy","primary outcome","millions of viewers","usefulness","Government","reviewers","spread of misinformation","keywords","coronavirus","significant role","METHODS","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS Orthodontically relevant sources of information were searched using electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar and current reports from major health bodies such as Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, and major national orthodontic associations. RESULTS Where available, peer-reviewed and more recent publications were given priority. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 and limitations in quality of evidence, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Relevant to orthodontics, human-to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs predominantly through the respiratory tract via droplets, secretions (cough, sneeze), and or direct contact, where the virus enters the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, and eyes. The virus can remain stable for days on plastic and stainless steel. Most infected persons experience a mild form of disease, but those with advanced age or underlying comorbidities may suffer severe respiratory and multiorgan complications. CONCLUSIONS During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective orthodontic treatment should be suspended and resumed only when permitted by federal, provincial, and local health regulatory authorities. Emergency orthodontic treatment can be provided by following a contingency plan founded on effective communication and triage. Treatment advice should be delivered remotely first when possible, and where necessary, in-person treatment can be performed in a well-prepared operatory following the necessary precautions and infection prevention and control (IPAC) protocol.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suri, Sunjay; Vandersluis, Yona R; Kochhar, Anuraj S; Bhasin, Ritasha; Abdallah, Mohamed-Nur","journal":"The Angle orthodontist","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2319/033120-236.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396601/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Centers of Disease Control"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elective orthodontic treatment","provision of emergency orthodontic treatment","person treatment","Treatment advice","coronavirus disease","major national orthodontic associations","major health bodies","National Institutes of Health","World Health Organization","infection prevention","Centers of Disease Control","respiratory tract","SARS-CoV","local health regulatory authorities","implications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","human transmission of SARS","mild form of disease","evolving nature of COVID","necessary precautions","contingency management","contingency plan","available data","METHODS Orthodontically relevant sources of information","Google Scholar","current reports","PubMed","electronic databases","underlying comorbidities","sneeze","days","droplets","secretions","pandemic","quality of evidence","comprehensive summary","advanced age","mouth","nose","plastic","cough","peer","mucous membrane","effective communication","MATERIALS","limitations","orthodontics","IPAC","stainless steel","infected persons","multiorgan complications","recent publications","narrative synthesis","triage","direct contact","spread","protocol","priority","eyes","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","literature","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Contact tracing is a well-established feature of public health practice during infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics. However, the high proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19 means that standard contact tracing methods are too slow to stop the progression of infection through the population. To address this problem, many countries around the world have deployed or are developing mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing. Informed by the on-going mapping of \u0027proximity events\u0027 these apps are intended both to inform public health policy and to provide alerts to individuals who have been in contact with a person with the infection. The proposed use of mobile phone data for \u0027intelligent physical distancing\u0027 in such contexts raises a number of important ethical questions.

With this technique, we temporarily change the Borden classification from type II to type III, avoiding venous compromise and reducing the risk of Onyx migration into the patent sinus. A 54-year-old man presented with left persistent tinnitus of 4 months\u0027 duration. Cerebral angiography revealed a Borden type II left lateral tentorial sinus-DAVF associated with retrograde cortical venous reflux draining into the vein of Labb\u00E9. In the venous phase, the ipsilateral transverse-sigmoid sinus was recognized as a functional sinus and the posterior temporal vein drained into the transverse sinus near the drainage channel. We planned to perform transarterial Onyx embolization using a short-length sinus protection balloon to protect against Onyx migration. During transarterial Onyx injection, a 7 \u00D7 7-mm HyperForm balloon was navigated into the affected sinus and positioned to cover the drainage channel from the shunt. After confirming the change in Borden classification with angiography, transarterial Onyx embolization was performed via the middle meningeal artery.

The purpose of our study was to predict the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient outcomes and use of hospital resources in Ontario, Canada. METHODS We developed an individuallevel simulation to model the flow of patients with COVID-19 through the hospital system in Ontario. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory and hospital health care capacity. Our outcomes included the number of patients who needed admission to the ward or to the intensive care unit (ICU) with or without the need for mechanical ventilation, number of days to resource depletion, number of patients awaiting resources and number of deaths. RESULTS We found that with effective early public health measures, hospital system resources would not be depleted. For scenarios with late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, hospital resources would be depleted within 14-26 days, and in the worst case scenario, 13 321 patients would die while waiting for needed resources. Resource depletion would be avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to increase ICU, ventilator and acute care hospital capacities. INTERPRETATION We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures, the Ontario hospital system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19 despite a rapid increase in capacity. This lack of hospital resources would have led to an increase in mortality. By slowing the spread of the disease using public health measures and by increasing hospital capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its hospitals.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Mac, Stephen; Ximenes, Raphael; Naimark, David M J; Sander, Beate","journal":"CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l\u0027Association medicale canadienne","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409519/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["hospital capacity","hospital system resources","Ontario hospital system","lack of hospital resources","hospital health care capacity","COVID","needed resources","acute care hospital capacities","expected number of patients","number of days","health care systems","aggressive measures","flow of patients","number of deaths","aggressive physical distancing measures","effective early public health measures","ICU","intensive care unit","rapid increase","Resource depletion","ineffective implementation of physical distancing","global spread of coronavirus disease","patient outcomes","different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory","ventilator","substantial strain","ward","BACKGROUND","pandemic","mechanical ventilation","worst case scenario","individuallevel simulation","catastrophic stresses","jurisdictions","admission","Canada","study","METHODS","hospitals","INTERPRETATION","purpose","mortality"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the role of amino acid 159 of the E protein in the pathogenesis of WNV infection. We produced recombinant WNV with the structural proteins of the NY99 or Eg101 strain (NY-WT or EgCME-WT) and mutant viruses with substitutions of amino acid 159 of the E protein (NY-E-V159I or EgCME-E-I159V).

In contrast, the mortality rate and viral titer in the brains of mice inoculated intracranially with EgCME-E-I159V were significantly higher than those of mice inoculated with EgCME-WT. The numbers of CD3-positive and CD8-positive T cells were greater in brains inoculated with EgCME-E-I159V than in those inoculated with EgCME-WT.

Much research into Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs) over the years has focused on comparisons between neuro-typical people and people with Autism Spectrum Conditions. These comparisons have tended to draw attention to \u0027deficits\u0027 in cognitive abilities and descriptions of behaviours that are characterised as unwanted. Not surprisingly, this is reflected in the classification systems from the World Health Organisation and the American Psychiatric Association. Public opinion about ASC may be influenced by presentations in the media of those with ASC who also have intellectual disability. Given that diagnostic systems are intended to help us better understand conditions in order to seek improved outcomes, we propose a more constructive approach to descriptions that uses more positive language, and balances descriptions of deficits with research finding of strengths and differences. We propose that this will be more helpful to individuals on the Autism Spectrum, both in terms of individual self-view, but also in terms of how society views Autism Spectrum Conditions more positively. Commentary has also been made on guidance that has been adjusted for people with ASC in relation to the current COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wright, Barry; Spikins, Penny; Pearson, Hannah","journal":"Medicina","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina56050233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32413984/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Autism Spectrum Condition","Autism Spectrum Conditions","World Health Organisation","American Psychiatric Association","ASC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["society views Autism Spectrum Conditions","research","descriptions of behaviours","comparisons","neuro-typical people","balances descriptions of deficits","complex presentations","classification systems","diagnostic systems","terms of individual self-view","World Health Organisation","cognitive abilities","positive language","American Psychiatric Association","ASCs","attention","current COVID","deficits\u0027","disorder","years","relation","complexity","improved outcomes","special issue","strengths","constructive approach","individuals","question","pandemic","differences","Public opinion","intellectual disability","guidance","media","human diversity","Commentary"],"language":"en"},

This study assesses its efficacy in patients admitted to critical care following cardiovascular surgery and the influence of standard antithrombotic agents routinely used in this specific group. METHODS Consecutive cardiovascular surgery patients treated with post-dilution hemofiltration with RCA were included in this prospective observational study. The primary outcome of the study was CRRT circuit life-span adjusted for reasons other than clotting. The secondary outcome evaluated the influence of standard antithrombotic agents (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] or fondaparinux as thromboprophylaxis or treatment dose with or without ASA) on filter life. RESULTS Fifty-two patients underwent 193 sessions of CVVH, after exclusion of 15 sessions where unfractionated heparin was administered. The median filter life span was 58 hours. Filter life span was significantly longer in patients receiving therapeutic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (79 h [2-110]), in comparison to patients treated with prophylactic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (51 h [7-117], p \u003C 0.001), and patients without antithrombotic prophylaxis (42 h [2-91], p \u003C 0.0001). 12 bleeding episodes were observed; 8 occurred in patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation, 3 in patients receiving prophylactic dose anticoagulation and 1 in a patient with no antithrombotic prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS A post dilution hemofiltration with RCA provides prolonged filter life span when adjusted for reasons other than clotting. Patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation had a significantly longer filter life span than those who were on prophylactic doses or ASA alone.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ko\u015Bka, Agnieszka; Kirwan, Christopher J; Kowalik, Maciej M; Lango-Maziarz, Anna; Szymanowicz, Wiktor; Jagielak, Dariusz; Lango, Romuald","journal":"Cardiology journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5603/cj.a2020.0039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32207837/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LMWH","RCA","ASA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["longer filter life span","prophylactic dose anticoagulation","treatment dose anticoagulation","prolonged filter life span","median filter life span","prophylactic dose of LMWH","CRRT circuit life-span","therapeutic dose of LMWH","RCA","METHODS Consecutive cardiovascular surgery patients","ASA","fondaparinux","antithrombotic prophylaxis","influence of standard antithrombotic agents","recommended standard","reasons","prophylactic doses","clotting","BACKGROUND Regional citrate anticoagulation","post-dilution hemofiltration","post dilution hemofiltration","prospective observational study","unfractionated heparin","sessions of CVVH","primary outcome","secondary outcome","low molecular weight heparin","acetylsalicylic acid","continuous renal replacement therapy","critical care","exclusion","CONCLUSIONS","efficacy","hours","thromboprophylaxis","comparison","specific group","RESULTS","bleeding episodes"],"language":"en"},

Reports of thromboembolic complications are scarce but suggestive for a clinical relevance of the problem. OBJECTIVES Prospective observational study aimed to characterize the coagulation profile of COVID-19 ARDS patients with standard and viscoelastic coagulation tests, and to evaluate their changes after establishment of an aggressive thromboprophylaxis. METHODS Sixteen patients with COVID-19 ARDS received a complete coagulation profile at the admission in the intensive care unit. Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases. RESULTS At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa, interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa, interquartile range 6-13.5 elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 \u03BCg/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933). Fibrinogen levels were associated (R2 =0.506, P=0.003) with interleukin-6 values. After increasing the thromboprophylaxis, there was a significant (P=0.001) time-related decrease of fibrinogen levels, D-dimers (P=0.017), CS (P=0.013), PCS (P=0.035) and FCS (P=0.038). CONCLUSION The pro-coagulant pattern of these patients may justify the clinical reports of thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism) during the course of the disease. Further studies are needed to assess the best prophylaxis and treatment of this condition.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ranucci, Marco; Ballotta, Andrea; Di Dedda, Umberto; Bayshnikova, Ekaterina; Dei Poli, Marco; Resta, Marco; Falco, Mara; Albano, Gianni; Menicanti, Lorenzo","journal":"Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302448/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","CS","FCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interquartile range","ARDS patients","pro-coagulant profile of patients","coagulation profile of COVID","hPa","complete coagulation profile","fibrinogen contribution","pro-coagulant pattern","antithrombin levels correction","elevated D-dimer levels","time-related decrease of fibrinogen levels","clinical reports of thromboembolic complications","PCS","FCS","viscoelastic coagulation tests","D-dimers","clinical relevance","platelet contribution","aggressive thromboprophylaxis","dose of low molecular weight heparin","increased clot strength","admission","pulmonary embolism","acute respiratory distress syndrome","clopidogrel","respect","\u03BCg","changes","OBJECTIVES Prospective observational study","best prophylaxis","selected cases","intensive care unit","treatment","condition","course","establishment","observations","CONCLUSION","baseline","R2","days","BACKGROUND","problem","interleukin","RESULTS","METHODS","values","disease","studies","hyperfibrinogenemia"],"language":"en"},

METHODS 3D patch-based convolutional neural networks were trained to predict conductivity maps from B1 transceive phase data. To compare the performance of DL-EPT networks on different datasets, three datasets were used throughout this work, one from simulations and two from in-vivo measurements from healthy volunteers and cancer patients, respectively. At first, networks trained on simulations were tested on all datasets with different levels of homogeneous Gaussian noise introduced in training and testing. Secondly, to investigate potential robustness towards systematical differences between simulated and measured phase maps, in-vivo data with conductivity labels from conventional EPT were used for training. RESULTS High quality conductivity reconstructions from networks trained on simulations with and without noise confirms the potential of deep learning for EPT. However, when this network is used for in-vivo reconstructions, measurement related artifacts affect the quality of conductivity maps. Training DL-EPT networks using conductivity labels from conventional EPT improves the quality of the results.

In this study we aimed to evaluate the discriminative ability of hematologic, biochemical and immunologic biomarkers in patients with and without the severe or fatal forms of COVID-19. Methods An electronic search in Medline (PubMed interface), Scopus, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was performed, to identify studies reporting on laboratory abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. Studies were divided into two separate cohorts for analysis: severity (severe vs. non-severe and mortality, i.e. non-survivors vs. survivors). Data was pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each laboratory parameter. Results A total number of 21 studies was included, totaling 3377 patients and 33 laboratory parameters. While 18 studies (n = 2984) compared laboratory findings between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19, the other three (n = 393) compared survivors and non-survivors of the disease and were thus analyzed separately. Patients with severe and fatal disease had significantly increased white blood cell (WBC) count, and decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts compared to non-severe disease and survivors. Biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac and muscle injury, liver and kidney function and coagulation measures were also significantly elevated in patients with both severe and fatal COVID-19. Interleukins 6 (IL-6) and 10 (IL-10) and serum ferritin were strong discriminators for severe disease. Conclusions Several biomarkers which may potentially aid in risk stratification models for predicting severe and fatal COVID-19 were identified. In hospitalized patients with respiratory distress, we recommend clinicians closely monitor WBC count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, IL-6 and serum ferritin as markers for potential progression to critical illness.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henry, Brandon Michael; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Benoit, Stefanie; Plebani, Mario; Lippi, Giuseppe","journal":"Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32286245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-severe COVID","non-severe disease","fatal COVID","non-survivors","fatal disease","fatal forms of COVID","hospitalized patients","studies","lymphocyte count","WBC count","laboratory predictors","coronavirus disease","laboratory findings","laboratory abnormalities","laboratory parameters","serum ferritin","immunologic biomarkers","Biomarkers of inflammation","platelet counts","potential progression","decreased lymphocyte","meta-analysis","critical illness","liver","Web of Science","muscle injury","Medline","China National Knowledge Infrastructure","PubMed interface","kidney function","Scopus","severity","identification of clinical","white blood cell","mortality","WMD","electronic search","weighted mean difference","urgent need","clinicians","strong discriminators","coagulation measures","discriminative ability of hematologic","separate cohorts","risk stratification models","CNKI","respiratory distress","pandemic rages","confidence interval","Methods","Background","Data","total number","study","Conclusions","Interleukins"],"language":"en"},

The current study examined the possibility of an association of parents\u0027 employment status with youth injury and the interaction of this status with other socio-economic factors and ethnicity. METHODS We distributed to adolescents aged 11-15 years, in class, the Israel Health Behavior in School-Aged Children Survey. We distinguished between any injury and severe injury, defining the latter as one necessitating the use of a cast, stitches and crutches or overnight hospitalization. RESULTS Of 13 705 respondents, 6224 (45%) had an injury in the past year that required medical treatment and 1827 pupils (13.5%) reported severe injuries. The odds of any injury were 1.86 for boys as against girls (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73-1.99), 0.80 for school grade (95% CI 0.78-0.82), 1.56 for Arabs vs. Jews (95% CI 1.43-1.70) and 1.10 for high Family Affluence Scale (FAS) vs. medium FAS (95% CI 1.01-1.21). Only in the low FAS group, when two parents were unemployed, the odds for severe injury was 1.36 (95% CI 1.03-1.78); when one or two parents were employed, the odds of severe child injury were the same (OR 1.13 and 95% CI 0.92-1.40). CONCLUSION Factors that were found to increase the risk of injury among youth were parental unemployment, low socio-economic status and Arab ethnicity. The home environment was the most common place for injury.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maya, Siman-Tov; Aviad, Tur-Sinai; Tanya, Kolobov; Orna, Baron-Epel; Yossi, Harel-Fisch","journal":"European journal of public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408347/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe injury","youth injury","risk of injury","odds of severe child injury","severe injuries","low socio-economic status","BACKGROUND Youth","medium FAS","low FAS group","socio-economic factors","association of parents\u0027 employment status","poorer health","Arab ethnicity","School-Aged Children Survey","school grade","overnight hospitalization","CONCLUSION Factors","Israel Health Behavior","parental unemployment","possibility","stitches","high Family Affluence Scale","interaction","cast","medical treatment","crutches","class","common place","past year","well-being","girls","home environment","years","pupils","confidence interval","current study","adolescents","use","Arabs","Jews","boys","RESULTS","respondents","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS In bovine liver tissue, 42 ex vivo microwave ablations (60 W; 180 s) were performed. During ablation, the temperature was measured continuously at 4 points of interest (POI), in a distance of 7.5 and 15 mm on each side of the microwave antenna, with a titanium surgical placed at one 7.5-mm POI. Ablation volumes containing large vessels (n = 10) were excluded. For every POI, the mean temperature of 32 ablations was calculated. The mean temperatures were compared between the 4 POI and statistically analyzed using the Student\u0027s t test. RESULTS The mean maximum temperatures at the side of the clip were 88.76 \u00B0C/ 195 s and 52.97 \u00B0C/ 195 s and at the side without clip 78.75 \u00B0C/ 195 s and 43.16 \u00B0C/ 195 s, respectively, at POI 7.5 mm and POI 15 mm. The maximum difference of mean temperatures for POI 7.5 mm was 12.91 \u00B0C at 84 s (p = 0.022) and for POI 15 mm 9.77 \u00B0C at 195 s (p = 0.009). No significant changes in size and shape of the ablation zone could be determined. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated significantly higher temperatures adjacent to surgical clips. Also, the temperatures distal to the titanium clip were higher compared to the control location without clip. These findings suggest an increased risk of thermal damage to surrounding tissues during MWA, especially in case of immediate contact to surgical clips.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liebl, Martin; Schulze-Hagen, Maximilian; Zimmermann, Markus; Pedersoli, Federico; Kuhl, Christiane; Bruners, Philipp; Isfort, Peter","journal":"Cardiovascular and interventional radiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-020-02453-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32236668/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mean maximum temperatures","temperatures distal","maximum difference of mean temperatures","titanium clip","higher temperatures adjacent","Ablation volumes","ablation zone","titanium surgical placed","heat generation of surgical clips","study","ablations","PURPOSE","microwave antenna","target area of MWA","bovine liver tissue","increased risk of thermal damage","ex","tissues","size","shape","influences","case of immediate contact","MATERIALS","METHODS","large vessels","significant changes","findings","CONCLUSIONS","control location","Student\u0027s t test","points","distance"],"language":"en"},

METHODS The laboratory tests including blood routine, cytokine profiles and infection markers were collected from 389 confirmed COVID-19 patients. RESULTS The included patients were classified into mild (n=168), severe (n=169) and critical groups (n=52). The leukocytes, neutrophils, infection biomarkers (such as CRP, PCT and ferritin) and the concentrations of cytokines (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03B1) were significantly increased while lymphocytes were significantly decreased with increased severity of illness. The amounts of IL-2R was positively correlated with the other cytokines and negatively correlated with lymphocyte number. The ratio of IL-2R to lymphocytes was found remarkably increased in severe and critical patients. IL-2R/lymphocyte was superior compared with other markers for the identification of COVID-19 with critical illness not only from mild but also from severe illness. Moreover, the cytokine profiles and IL-2R/lymphocyte were significantly decreased in recovered patients but further increased in disease deteriorated patients, which might be correlated with the outcome of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Lymphopenia and increased levels of cytokines were closely associated with the disease severity. IL-2R/lymphocyte was a prominent biomarker for early identification of severe COVID-19 and predicting the clinical progression of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Hongyan; Zhang, Bo; Huang, Hui; Luo, Ying; Wu, Shiji; Tang, Guoxing; Liu, Weiyong; Mao, Lie; Mao, Liyan; Wang, Feng; Sun, Ziyong","journal":"Clinical and experimental immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365221/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["amounts of IL","ratio of IL","critical patients","disease deteriorated patients","increased severity of illness","identification of COVID","severe illness","estimation of disease severity","early identification of severe COVID","confirmed COVID","outcome of COVID","recovered patients","critical illness","included patients","increased levels of cytokines","infection markers","clinical progression of coronavirus disease","lymphocyte number","cytokine profiles","concentrations of cytokines","critical groups","lymphocytes","BACKGROUND Effective laboratory markers","laboratory tests","infection biomarkers","blood routine","prominent biomarker","PCT","CRP","METHODS","ferritin","CONCLUSIONS Lymphopenia","leukocytes","neutrophils","TNF-\u03B1"],"language":"en"},

Early reports of this infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consisted of mostly adult patients. As the outbreak spreads rapidly beyond the epicentre of Wuhan, it becomes clear that infants and children of all ages are susceptible to this infection. In China, there have been more than 1200 paediatric cases. Most paediatric patients acquire the infection through household contact with infected adults. The disease in children is usually self-limiting and most infected children will recover uneventfully within 7-10 days. Other than symptoms of the respiratory tract, many children may present with gastrointestinal symptoms. Older children are more likely to have asymptomatic infection. Although deaths related to SARS-CoV-2 are rarely reported in the paediatric age group, young children and those with underlying medical conditions are more likely to develop severe illness. Only a small fraction of neonates born to infected mother would acquire the virus by vertical transmission. Because a large proportion of children and adolescents may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection, children are likely to play an important role in community transmission of this infection. Screening of children who have a definitive contact history will facilitate early diagnosis and isolation of all infected children. This review summarises the lessons learned in China with regard to the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the paediatric population.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Xiaoxia; Xing, Yuhan; Wong, Gary Wing-Kin","journal":"Archives of disease in childhood","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-319261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398322/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["infected children","young children","Screening of children","Older children","asymptomatic infection","large proportion of children","SARS-CoV","paediatric patients","infected mother","infected adults","paediatric population","paediatric cases","paediatric age group","China","current understanding of SARS","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","household contact","early diagnosis","novel coronavirus","respiratory tract","severe illness","Early reports","community transmission","vertical transmission","adult patients","gastrointestinal symptoms","definitive contact history","regard","adolescents","underlying medical conditions","important role","isolation","epicentre of Wuhan","infants","ages","small fraction of neonates","different regions","lessons","outbreak spreads","globe","review","disease","deaths","days"],"language":"en"},

Indirect evidence from related conditions must therefore inform inferences regarding benefits and harms. To support a guideline for managing COVID-19, we conducted systematic reviews examining the impact of corticosteroids in COVID-19 and related severe acute respiratory illnesses. METHODS We searched standard international and Chinese biomedical literature databases and prepublication sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing corticosteroids versus no corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). For acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), influenza and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we updated the most recent rigorous systematic review. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool relative risks and then used baseline risk in patients with COVID-19 to generate absolute effects. RESULTS In ARDS, according to 1 small cohort study in patients with COVID-19 and 7 RCTs in non-COVID-19 populations (risk ratio [RR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 0.93, mean difference 17.3% fewer; low-quality evidence), corticosteroids may reduce mortality. In patients with severe COVID-19 but without ARDS, direct evidence from 2 observational studies provided very low-quality evidence of an increase in mortality with corticosteroids (hazard ratio [HR] 2.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.29, mean difference 11.9% more), as did observational data from influenza studies. Observational data from SARS and MERS studies provided very low-quality evidence of a small or no reduction in mortality. Randomized controlled trials in CAP suggest that corticosteroids may reduce mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.98, 3.1% lower; very low-quality evidence), and may increase hyperglycemia. INTERPRETATION Corticosteroids may reduce mortality for patients with COVID-19 and ARDS. For patients with severe COVID-19 but without ARDS, evidence regarding benefit from different bodies of evidence is inconsistent and of very low quality.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, Zhikang; Wang, Ying; Colunga-Lozano, Luis Enrique; Prasad, Manya; Tangamornsuksan, Wimonchat; Rochwerg, Bram; Yao, Liang; Motaghi, Shahrzad; Couban, Rachel J; Ghadimi, Maryam; Bala, Malgorzata M; Gomaa, Huda; Fang, Fang; Xiao, Yingqi; Guyatt, Gordon H","journal":"CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l\u0027Association medicale canadienne","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200645; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","SARS","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","patients","low-quality evidence","non-COVID","Indirect evidence","ARDS","mortality","use of corticosteroids","impact of corticosteroids","INTERPRETATION Corticosteroids","observational studies","little direct evidence","different bodies of evidence","severe acute respiratory syndrome","MERS studies","influenza studies","observational data","CI","related severe acute respiratory illnesses","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Middle East respiratory syndrome","SARS","RCTs","randomized controlled trials","risk ratio","RR","CAP","mean difference","increase","baseline risk","related conditions","hazard ratio","systematic reviews","absolute effects","small cohort study","random-effects meta-analyses","recent rigorous systematic review","prepublication sources","Chinese biomedical literature databases","relative risks","populations","fewer","coronavirus disease","inferences","community","HR","confidence interval","benefits","METHODS","pneumonia","BACKGROUND","reduction","low quality","harms","RESULTS","hyperglycemia","guideline"],"language":"en"},

Method: s Organized by maternal and child health care institute in the 16 districts of Shanghai, a cross sectional study was conducted among pregnant women who came to pregnancy registration in the community health centers or attended ANC in midwifery hospitals from February 7 to February 12, 2020. Consented participating women completed a semi-structured online questionnaire voluntarily. Data was analyzed using frequency,chi-square test and scoring. Result: s A total of 2 002 valid questionnaires were collected from 183 community health centers and 67 midwifery hospitals. About 94.6%(1 894/2 002) of the pregnant women worried about being infected during the COVID-19 epidemic, and 14.7% (294/2 002) demanded for psychological consultation. Time-lapse appointments for ANC were requested by 87.7% (1 756/2 002) of the participants for avoiding presenting themselves in people-density places. Compared with other pregnancy trimesters, pregnant women in the second trimester were more willing to reduce the frequency of ANC (35.2% versus 39.5% versus 48.1%, P\u003C0.01). Compared with multiparas, primiparas were more willing to have online consultation and guidance (49.2% versus 63.8%, P\u003C0.01). Regarding the needs for health knowledge on COVID-19, personal protection against 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the most concerned for pregnant women, and 71.0% (1 421/2 002) of them preferred to obtain knowledge through health applications, official Weibo and WeChat. Conclusions: Pregnant women in Shanghai critically concern about the risk of 2019-nCoV infections, and highly demand knowledge and measures on prevention and protection from COVID-19. They ask for having time-lapse appointments for ANC and online access to health information and services. Maternal and child care institutes should understand the demands of pregnant women, optimize the means of ANC service, and provide tailored and accessible health education and service for the safety of mother and child.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, L; Gu, Y B; Cui, M Q; Li, W X; Wang, J; Zhu, L P; Xu, B","journal":"Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112141-20200218-00112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32268713/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ANC"],"locations":["Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["demands of pregnant women","health knowledge","frequency of ANC","health applications","health information","community health centers","means of ANC service","child health care institute","Consented participating women","accessible health education","epidemic of COVID","pregnancy trimesters","online consultation","child care institutes","online access","pregnancy registration","districts of Shanghai","demand knowledge","different trimesters of pregnancy","antenatal care","midwifery hospitals","Time-lapse appointments","semi-structured online questionnaire","personal protection","nCoV infections","psychological consultation","cross sectional study","official Weibo","measures","prevention","valid questionnaires","total","novel coronavirus","WeChat","services","safety of mother","chi-square test","scoring","problems","primiparas","risk","guidance","needs","Conclusions","people-density places","Data","multiparas","Result","Method","participants","Objective"],"language":"en"},

The GALI is widely used in the European Union; however, evidence of its construct validity is still limited. We examine whether the GALI reflects disability in specific living contexts such as self-care, domestic life and work activity, whether it does so consistently across gender and age and its added value concerning SRH. METHODS We used the subsample of adults aged 16-64 years (N = 15 934) from the 2009 European Health Interview Survey in Spain and analyzed the data with logistic regression models using the GALI and SRH as response variables. RESULTS The GALI was strongly and significantly associated with the three measures of disability: self-care (OR = 22.8, 95% CI: 15.9-32.7), domestic life (OR = 16.3, 95% CI: 13.6-19.5) and work activity (e.g. impossibility to work: OR = 41.9, 95% CI: 30.3-57.8; prolonged sick leave: OR = 10.7, 95% CI: 9-12.7). There were significant interactions with age on all three disability measures and with the gender on one (domestic life), although they were small. SRH was also strongly associated with all three disability measures, but to a lesser extent than the GALI. CONCLUSIONS The GALI reflects well and better than SRH, disability in self-care, domestic life and work activity. It is unknown whether the GALI performs equally in other living contexts such as social relations and community life.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cabrero-Garc\u00EDa, Julio; Juli\u00E1-Sanchis, Roc\u00EDo; Richart-Mart\u00EDnez, Miguel","journal":"European journal of public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408346/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GALI","SRH"],"locations":["European Union","Spain"],"keyphrases":["GALI","SRH","domestic life","measures of disability","disability measures","work activity","self-care","community life","BACKGROUND health measures","self-rated health","age","European Health Interview Survey","gender","global activity limitation indicator","specific living contexts","European Union","Spain","data","logistic regression models","social relations","evidence","added value","lesser extent","response variables","prolonged sick leave","subsample of adults","significant interactions","years","METHODS","construct validity","CONCLUSIONS","impossibility","population"],"language":"en"},

On 30-31 January 2020, the protocol and reagents for these assays were distributed to local public health institutes and quarantine depots in Japan, and nationwide, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was started. For further validation, the assays were compared with the commercially available kits using SARS CoV-2 viral RNA and the clinical specimens obtained from COVID19-suspected individuals. The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LN S\u0026W-E) assay was highly sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, and both assays had perfectly consistent results with the clinical specimens. While the LM S\u0026W-E set targets the highly conserved region of the E gene in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. Thus, the N2 set has high specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Methods: A systematic search of the literature conducted in bibliographic databases including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane and Scientific Information Database using a comprehensive search strategy without time limit until the end of 2018, accomplished by reference tracking, author contacting and expert consultation to identify studies on the overuse of medical care. Results: We reviewed 4124 published articles based on predetermined inclusion criteria. The authors consensus included a total of 40 articles. Of these, 31 were in English and 9 in Farsi, published between 19975-2018. The result categorized into two distinct clinical areas: treatment (17 articles), and diagnostic (23 articles) services. Almost all of the studies only described the magnitude of unnecessary overuse. Unnecessary overuse of Antibiotics, MRI and CT-scan were the most reported topics. The ranges of their overuse proportion were as follows; Antibiotic (31 to 97%); MRI (33 to 88%), and CT-scan (19 to 50%). Conclusions: Our review showed, even so, the magnitude of unnecessary overuse of medical services is high but there are only a few interventional studies in clinical and administrative level for finding effective methods for decreasing these unnecessary services. Researchers should be encouraged to conducting interventional studies. We suggest the ministry of health to use the golden opportunity of COVID-19 epidemic for designing Iran national policy and action plan for controlling and preventing unnecessary health care services and including a section for Interventional Research in the action plan.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pezeshki, M.

The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs. Design: We proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey. Setting: We estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province. Participants: The number of people who returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou was selected from the daily notification of the pneumonia epidemic caused by a new coronavirus infection in the city. Exposures for observational studies: The daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan. Based on this rate, it is reasonable to predict the number of the infected patients.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yongdao; Dong, Jianghu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021774","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wenzhou","Wuhan","Hubei","Wenzhou City"],"keyphrases":["number of infected patients","overall infected patients","Wenzhou city","survey objects","overall infection rate","correct estimated infected patients","current measures of infected patients","number of cases","new coronavirus infection","total number of people","different samples of Wuhan tourists","daily rate","kind of non-comprehensive survey","overall situation","new coronavirus outbreak","pneumonia epidemic","estimation","Sampling surveys","daily notification","sampled data","better data collection system","prefecture-level cities","hospital wards","needed beds","Hubei Province","government","observational studies","information","Singapore","inference","disaster area","actual needs","quality of life","Exposures","person","history of living","Importance","denominator","China","units","Setting","Participants","numerator","Objective","Design"],"language":"en"},

Apart from forecasting the major turning points and parameters associated with the epidemic, we intend to provide an epidemiological assessment of the impact of these containment measures in India. Methods We propose a method based on time-series SIR model to estimate time-dependent modifiers for transmission rate of the infection. These modifiers are used in state-space SIR model to estimate reproduction number R0, expected total incidence, and to forecast the daily prevalence till the end of the epidemic. We consider four different scenarios, two based on current developments and two based on hypothetical situations for the purpose of comparison. Results Assuming gradual relaxation in lockdown post 17 May 2020, we expect the prevalence of infecteds to cross 9 million, with at least 1 million severe cases, around the end of October 2020. For the same case, estimates of R0 for the phases no-intervention, partial-lockdown and lockdown are 4.46 (7.1), 1.47 (2.33), and 0.817 (1.29) respectively, assuming 14-day (24-day) infectious period. Conclusions Estimated modifiers give consistent estimates of unadjusted R0 across different scenarios, demonstrating precision. Results corroborate the effectiveness of lockdown measures in substantially reducing R0. Also, predictions are highly sensitive towards estimate of infectious period.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deo, V.; Chetiya, A.

We analyse highly-resolved spatial variables for cities in China together with case count data in order to investigate the role of climate, urbanization, and variation in interventions across China. Here we show that the epidemic intensity of COVID-19 is strongly shaped by crowding, such that epidemics in dense cities are more spread out through time, and denser cities have larger total incidence. Observed differences in epidemic intensity are well captured by a metapopulation model of COVID-19 that explicitly accounts for spatial hierarchies.

Underlying medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease are based on adult data, but have been applied across all ages resulting in large numbers of families undertaking social shielding (vulnerable group). We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with suspected COVID-19 at a Specialist Childrens Hospital to determine outcomes based on COVID-19 testing status and underlying health vulnerabilities. Methods: Routine clinical data were extracted retrospectively from the Institutions Electronic Health Record system and Digital Research Environment for patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses. Data were compared between Sars-CoV-2 positive and negative patients (CoVPos / CoVNeg respectively), and in relation to presence of underlying health vulnerabilities based on Public Health England guidance. Findings: Between 1st March and 15th May 2020, 166 children (\u003C18 years of age) presented to a specialist childrens hospital with clinical features of possible COVID-19 infection. 65 patients (39.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. CoVPos patients were older (median 9 [0.9-14] years vs median 1 [0.1-5.7.5] years respectively, p\u003C0.001). There was a significantly reduced proportion of vulnerable cases (47.7% vs 72.3%, p=0.002), but no difference in proportion of vulnerable patients requiring ventilation (61% vs 64.3%, p = 0.84) between CoVPos and CoVNeg groups. However, a significantly lower proportion of CoVPos patients required mechanical ventilation support compared to CoVNeg patients (27.7 vs 57.4%, p\u003C0.001). Mortality was not significantly different between CoVPos and CoVNeg groups (1.5 vs 4% respectively, p=0.67) although there were no direct COVID-19 related deaths in this highly preselected paediatric population. Interpretation: COVID-19 infection may be associated with severe disease in childhood presenting to a specialist hospital, but does not appear significantly different in severity to other causes of similar clinical presentations. In children presenting with pre-existing COVID-19 vulnerable medical conditions at a specialist centre, there does not appear to be significantly increased risk of either contracting COVID-19 or severe complications, apart from those undergoing chemotherapy, who are over-represented.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Issitt, R.; Booth, J.; Bryant, W.; Spiridou, A.; Taylor, A.; DuPre, P.; Ramnarayan, P.; Hartley, J.; Cortino Borja, M.; Moshal, K.; Dunn, H.; Hemingway, H.; Sebire, N.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a8e127c56624cd15668c0aaa40f4e7d24870644.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.20.20107904v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Specialist Childrens Hospital","Digital Research Environment","Public Health England"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspected COVID","CoVNeg patients","confirmed COVID","pre-existing COVID","direct COVID","proportion of vulnerable patients","negative patients","lower proportion of CoVPos patients","clinical features of possible COVID","specialist hospital","years vs median","CoVNeg groups","Specialist Childrens Hospital","vulnerable medical conditions","presence of underlying health vulnerabilities","vulnerable group","specialist centre","increased risk of severe disease","Routine clinical data","reduced proportion of vulnerable cases","severity","outcomes of coronavirus disease","severe complications","Sars-CoV","infection","adult data","retrospective analysis of children","years of age","Public Health England guidance","Institutions Electronic Health Record system","causes of similar clinical presentations","mechanical ventilation support","Digital Research Environment","social shielding","large numbers of families","related deaths","testing status","relation","undergoing chemotherapy","evidence of significant differences","childhood","preselected paediatric population","ages","Methods","diagnoses","Mortality","Interpretation","Background","adults","Findings"],"language":"en"},

SUMMARY The recent appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on the general population. Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable. We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology. Material and methods: The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020. It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an \u0022online\u0022 registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact. acquainted with another patient. Results: As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of TRS is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids. Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Emilio S\u00E1nchez-\u00C1lvarez, J.; Font\u00E1n, Miguel P\u00E9rez; Mart\u00EDn, Carlos Jim\u00E9nez; Pel\u00EDcano, Miquel Blasco; Reina, Carlos Jes\u00FAs Cabezas; Prieto, \u00C1ngel M.

We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government\u0027s public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population\u0027s mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now should move from explaining that citizens should stay at home to what they can do at home. We need interventions that make staying at home and following public health protocols more desirable, or possibly even fun. These interventions could include virtual social interactions, such as online social reading activities, classes, exercise routines, among others - all designed to reduce the boredom of being socially isolated for long periods of time and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations.

Objective To describe a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for use in the COVID-19 era and present a case series of patients for whom the technique has been used. Design, Setting, and Participants Observational case series of pediatric patients undergoing emergency or urgent airway procedures performed at a tertiary pediatric otolaryngology department in Australia. Procedures were completed between March 23 and April 9, 2020, with a median (range) follow-up of 24.5 (11-28) days. Exposures Modified technique for microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, minimizing aerosolization of respiratory tract secretions. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the feasibility of technique, which was measured by ability to perform microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with comparable success to the usual technique (ie, adequate examination of the patient for diagnostic procedures and ability to perform interventional procedures). Results The technique was used successfully in 8 patients (median [range] age, 160 days [27 days to 2 years 6 months]); 5 patients were male, and 3 were female. Intervention was performed on 6 patients; 2 balloon dilations for subglottic stenosis, 2 injections of hyaluronic acid for type 1 clefts, and 2 cold-steel supraglottoplasties.

Identifying risk factors associated with repeat surgery will improve clinical management and prevent repeat VTI. METHODS Surgical records were assessed at 8 years following VTI surgery for rAOM in children 6-36 months of age. Children were grouped according to detection of bacterial otopathogen in their middle ear effusion (MEE) at the time of VTI, and outcomes for future otorhinolaryngology surgery compared. RESULTS Age, gender, pneumococcal vaccination status, antibiotic usage, day-care attendance, number of siblings and number of AOM episodes were similar between groups. Of the 63 children who had PCR \u002Bve MEE, 58.7% required repeat VTI compared with 31.4% of the 51 children with no otopathogen detected in their MEE (odds ratio = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [1.4-6.8]; P = 0.004). Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) was the predominant otopathogen in MEE (79% of all PCR \u002Bve MEE). Respiratory virus detection was not associated with repeat VTI. CONCLUSIONS Presence of bacterial otopathogen, specifically nontypeable H. influenzae, in the middle ear during VTI was a predictor of children at-risk of repeat VTI.

Diagnosis is challenging, especially in mild forms, leading to unnecessary periods of cessation of enteral feeding. This study aimed at establishing a prognosis score of enteropathy combining clinical parameters and faecal calprotectin concentration. METHODS This prospective multicentric study included preterm neonates born at a gestational age of 33 weeks or less. Stools were collected weekly until hospital discharge, and daily in case of digestive events for calprotectin measurement (ELISA and immunochromatography) and microbiota analyses (16S rRNA gene sequencing). RESULTS Among the 121 neonates included, 21 experienced at least one episode of enteropathy, mainly mild forms. By ELISA testing, median faecal calprotectin was 88 (8-798) \u00B5g/g faeces. No statistically significant association was found between the outset of enteropathy and maternal and neonatal characteristics, and calprotectin levels. The agreement between ELISA and immunochromatography assay was moderate (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.58, 95%CI [0.47-0.66]). Comparison of species diversity and relative bacterial abundance profiles between infants with or without enteropathy revealed no specific alterations associated with enteropathy.

An Evaluation of Concepts and Directions for Future Research.","doi":"10.1159/000507365","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32408298","license":"unk","abstract":"Throughout the life course, individuals are confronted with adversities that challenge their ability to live the life they imagined. Adversities that are the most prominently studied and shown to bring about the most serious consequences for adjustment across the adult lifespan include job loss, disease and disability onset, and spousal and child bereavement. However, not all individuals show sustained declines to adversity; some are able to bounce back. The resilience literature is built on the premise that individuals are able to bounce back, or adapt to adversity. The past 15-20 years have seen an abundance of resilience research examining resilience to diverse types of adversity across the adult life-span. The overarching goal of this paper is to evaluate psychological concepts of resilience in adulthood and old age and recommend avenues for future research. To do so, I first evaluate and discuss definitions of resilience and their overlap across literatures with an emphasis on sociological approaches to studying adversity across the adult lifespan. Second, I discuss promising conceptual and methodological approaches to advance the resilience literature in adulthood and old age. Conceptual approaches to furthering the resilience literature include incorporating an anticipation component into the definition of resilience. Methodological approaches to furthering the resilience literature include prospective longitudinal designs that incorporate quantitative and qualitative approaches, multidimensional assessments, and the need to examine repeated adversities or multiple adversities that transpire in relatively close proximity to one another.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Infurna, Frank J","journal":"Gerontology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000507365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resilience literature","definition of resilience","definitions of resilience","abundance of resilience research","psychological concepts of resilience","methodological approaches","Conceptual approaches","qualitative approaches","sociological approaches","individuals","adult lifespan","multiple adversities","repeated adversities","adult life-span","adulthood","old age","diverse types of adversity","life course","future research","disease","disability onset","job loss","prospective longitudinal designs","need","multidimensional assessments","adjustment","emphasis","avenues","literatures","anticipation component","paper","overlap","premise","child bereavement","serious consequences","sustained declines","years","close proximity","overarching goal"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL AND METHODS A Respironics V60 ventilator was connected to an active lung simulator modeling mildly restrictive, severely restrictive, obstructive and mixed obstructive/restrictive profiles. Pressure-support ventilation (PSV) and proportional-assist ventilation (PAV) were set to obtain similar tidal volume (VT). PAV was applied at flow assist (FA) 40-90% of resistance (Rrs) and volume assist (VA) 40-90% of elastance (Ers). Measurements were performed with system air leak of 25-28 L/minute. Ventilator performance and simulator-ventilator asynchrony were evaluated. RESULTS At comparable VT, PAV had slightly lower peak inspiratory flow and higher driving pressure compared with PSV. Premature cycling occurred in the obstructive, severely restrictive and mildly restrictive models. During PAV, time for airway pressure to achieve 90% of maximum during inspiration (T90) in the severely restrictive model was shorter than those of the obstructive and mixed obstructive/restrictive models and close to that measured in the PSV mode. Increasing FA level reduced inspiratory trigger workload (PTP\u2083\u2080\u2080) in obstructive and mixed obstructive/restrictive models. Increasing FA level decreased inspiratory time (TI) and tended to aggravate premature cycling, whereas increasing VA level attenuated this effect. CONCLUSIONS PAV with an appropriate combination of FA and VA decreases work of breathing during the inspiratory phase and improves simulator-ventilator cycling synchrony. FA has greater impact than VA in the adaptation to inspiratory effort demand. High VA level might help improve cycling synchrony.","publish_time":"2019-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yuqing; Yuan, Yueyang; Zhang, Hai; Li, Feng","journal":"Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.914629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31778366/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSV","PAV","VA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["restrictive models","restrictive profiles","inspiratory time","increasing VA level","inspiratory phase","Premature cycling","cycling synchrony","simulator-ventilator asynchrony","High VA level","inspiratory effort demand","FA level reduced inspiratory trigger workload","Ventilator performance","lung models","CONCLUSIONS PAV","lower peak inspiratory flow","flow assist","volume assist","appropriate combination of FA","Respironics V60 ventilator","Pressure-support ventilation","VA decreases work of breathing","active lung simulator modeling","airway pressure","non-invasive ventilation","PSV mode","higher driving pressure","breathing pattern","comparable VT","similar tidal volume","influence of respiratory mechanics","adaptation","PTP","synchronization","MATERIAL","METHODS","T90","study","greater impact","Rrs","Measurements","system air leak","maximum","resistance","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","effect","inspiration","elastance","Ers","minute"],"language":"en"},

But three of these viruses cause more serious, acute diseases; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS by MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2. The current outbreak was classified by the WHO as a \u0022global public health emergency\u0022. Despite all efforts to reduce the surgical lists and to cancel or postpone non-time-critical surgical interventions, some surgical and anesthetic interventions outside of intensive care medicine are still necessary and must be performed. This is particularly true for obstetric interventions and neuraxial labor analgesia. Workload in the delivery room is presumably not going to decrease and planned cesarean sections cannot be postponed. In the meantime, the clinical course and outcome of some COVID-19 patients with an existing pregnancy or peripartum courses have been reported. There are already numerous recommendations from national and international bodies regarding the care of such patients. Some of these recommendations will be summarized in this manuscript. The selection of aspects should by no means be seen as a form of prioritization. The general treatment principles in dealing with COVID-19 patients and the recommendations for action in intensive care therapy also apply to pregnant and postpartum patients. In this respect, there are naturally considerable redundancies and only a few aspects apply strictly or exclusively to the cohort of obstetric patients. In summary, at present it must be stated that the general care recommendations that also apply to non-COVID-19 patients are initially valid with regard to obstetric anesthesia. Nevertheless, the special requirements on the part of hygiene and infection protection result in special circumstances that should be taken into account when caring for pregnant patients from an anesthetic point of view. These relate to both medical aspects, but also to a particular extent logistics issues with regard to spatial separation, staffing and material resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kranke, Peter; Weibel, Stephanie; Sitter, Magdalena; Meybohm, Patrick; Girard, Thierry","journal":"Anasthesiologie, Intensivmedizin, Notfallmedizin, Schmerztherapie : AINS","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1144-5562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32274774/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["pregnant patients","postpartum patients","cohort of obstetric patients","general care recommendations","obstetric interventions","non-COVID","SARS-CoV","anesthetic interventions","MERS-CoV","numerous recommendations","intensive care therapy","intensive care medicine","regard","non-time-critical surgical interventions","surgical lists","obstetric anesthesia","selection of aspects","medical aspects","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","acute diseases","common colds","common human corona viruses","special circumstances","special requirements","anesthetic point of view","general treatment principles","spatial separation","particular extent logistics issues","international bodies","staffing","hygiene","outcome","action","neuraxial labor analgesia","existing pregnancy","material resources","infection protection","clinical course","peripartum courses","global public health emergency","meantime","means","considerable redundancies","account","Workload","delivery room","respect","efforts","form of prioritization","current outbreak","cesarean sections","summary","present","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

Forty lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from different sources and monitored for their anti-inflammatory potential against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammatory stress employing RAW 264.7 cells. Among these isolates, only four LAB isolates exhibited more than 90% nitric oxide inhibition and possessed the probiotic attributes. Further, these selected LAB isolates reduced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2 and IL-6, inhibited the phosphorylation of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) i.e. p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.

Five electronic databases were searched, supported by hand-searching of references of included studies. Screening of title/abstract and then full text papers was undertaken; key characteristics and outcomes were extracted and synthesised narratively. The likely impact of interventions was evaluated using Kirkpatrick\u0027s Hierarchy; study quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Of 7436 studies identified through database searching, and one additional study located through hand searching of reference lists, the final library consisted of 13 studies. All studies reported benefits for student learning from patient involvement, while one paper identified patient benefits from student interventions. Patients as recipients of care mostly contributed in a passive role in student education activities. Quality assessment identified methodological limitations in most studies. Patient involvement in the education of dietitians supports skill development and therefore progression to professional practice. Although nutrition and dietetics education has a focus on client-centred care, the translation of these concepts into an interactive student educational experience has been investigated to a limited extent.

Collection of the RW samples was made on a monthly basis during the period (1989-2006). The volume-weighted mean (VWM) values calculated for the different parameters at all stations show VWM values of 6.84 and 96 \u03BCS/cm for pH and EC, respectively. The ionic trend of the VWM concentrations (\u03BCeq/L) in the RW samples of entire dataset follows the descending order: Ca2\u002B \u2265 HCO3- \u003E SO42- \u003E Mg2\u002B \u003E Cl- \u003E Na\u002B \u003E NO3- \u003E K\u002B \u003E NH4\u002B. The lowest pH and EC values were found for the southern mountainous stations, while the highest were reported for the interior inland stations, depending on the amount of carbonate dust present in the atmosphere. The major part of the RW salinity (\u003E 70%) was due to Ca2\u002B, HCO3- and SO42- concentrations. The highest concentrations of Na\u002B and Cl- were found for the Tartous coastal station, where the Na\u002B/Cl- ratio (0.84 \u00B1 0.16) was remarkably very close to that of the Mediterranean Sea (MS) value (0.86), implying thus the sea spray effect. The highest NO3- concentrations (\u2248 8-9 mg/L), with relatively high SO42-/NO3- ratios (\u003E 2 \u00B1 1), were found for the major cities (Damascus, Homs and Aleppo), implying hence the influence of intensive traffics and urban pollutions. The pH parameter was moderately linked with Ca2\u002B and HCO3- (R2 \u2248 0.36), while EC was correlated with all ions, except NH4\u002B. This later ion was weakly correlated with NO3- (R2 \u2248 0.23). Strong correlations were found between Ca2\u002B and SO42- (R2 \u2248 0.80) and between Cl- and Na\u002B (R2 \u2248 0.95). Ca2\u002B and Mg2\u002B ions were the most responsible for neutralizing the RW acidity. The role of K\u002B and NH4\u002B as acidity neutralizers was small. By using the principal component analysis (PCA), five major factors, explaining \u2248 87% of the total variance, were suggested for the possible sources affecting the chemical composition of RW in this country. The factors are (1) crustal natural materials, (2) sea salts, (3) fossil fuel combustion, (4) rural activity, and (5) biomass burning.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kattan, Zuhair","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08257-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","VWM","RW"],"locations":["Syria","Mediterranean Sea","Damascus","Homs"],"keyphrases":["Ca2","SO42- concentrations","highest NO3- concentrations","highest concentrations of Na","EC values","VWM concentrations","HCO3","RW acidity","NH4","R2","VWM values","RW salinity","major ions","major factors","chemical composition of RW","Mg2","NO3- ratios","high SO42","RW samples of entire dataset","major cities","principal factors","lowest pH","pH parameter","Mediterranean Sea","sea salts","southern mountainous stations","interior inland stations","country","chemical composition of precipitation","sea spray effect","acidity neutralizers","principal component analysis","descending order","PCA","different parameters","electrical conductivity","Aleppo","fossil fuel combustion","Damascus","Homs","possible sources","\u03BCeq","\u03BCS","rainwater","crustal natural materials","volume-weighted mean","influence of intensive","monthly basis","ionic trend","carbonate dust present","atmosphere","rural activity","urban pollutions","Tartous coastal station","Syria","period","later ion","Strong correlations","Collection","total variance","biomass","role"],"language":"en"},

This study screens some African plants derived alkaloids and terpenoids as potential inhibitors of coronavirus 3CLpro using in silico approach.Bioactive alkaloids (62) and terpenoids (100) of plants native to Africa were docked to the 3CLpro of the novel SARS-CoV-2. The top twenty alkaloids and terpenoids with high binding affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were further docked to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The docking scores were compared with 3CLpro-referenced inhibitors (Lopinavir and Ritonavir). The top docked compounds were further subjected to ADEM/Tox and Lipinski filtering analyses for drug-likeness prediction analysis.This ligand-protein interaction study revealed that more than half of the top twenty alkaloids and terpenoids interacted favourably with the coronaviruses 3CLpro, and had binding affinities that surpassed that of lopinavir and ritonavir. Also, a highly defined hit-list of seven compounds (10-Hydroxyusambarensine, Cryptoquindoline, 6-Oxoisoiguesterin, 22-Hydroxyhopan-3-one, Cryptospirolepine, Isoiguesterin and 20-Epibryonolic acid) were identified.

A World Health Organization (WHO) initiative, The End Tuberculosis Strategy, set ambitious targets for 2020-2035, including 20% reduction in TB incidence and 35% reduction in the absolute number of TB deaths by 2020 and 90% reduction in TB incidence and 95% reduction in TB deaths by 2035, compared with 2015 (3). This report evaluated global progress toward these targets based on data reported by WHO (1). Annual TB data routinely reported to WHO by 194 member states were used to estimate TB incidence and mortality overall and among persons with HIV infection, TB-preventive treatment (TPT) initiation, and drug-resistant TB for 2018 (1). In 2018, an estimated 10 million persons had incident TB, and 1.5 million TB-related deaths occurred, representing 2% and 5% declines from 2017, respectively. The number of persons with both incident and prevalent TB remained highest in the WHO South-East Asia and African regions. Decreases in the European region were on track to meet 2020 targets. Globally, among persons living with HIV, 862,000 incident TB cases occurred, and 1.8 million persons initiated TPT. Rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB occurred among 3.4% of persons with new TB and 18% among persons who were previously treated for TB (overall, among 4.8% of persons with TB). The modest decreases in the number of persons with TB and the number of TB-related deaths were consistent with recent trends, and new and substantial progress was observed in increased TPT initiation among persons living with HIV. However, to meet the global targets for 2035, more intensive efforts are needed by public health partners to decrease TB incidence and deaths and increase the number of persons receiving TB curative and preventive treatment. Innovative approaches to case finding, scale-up of TB preventive treatment, use of newer TB treatment regimens, and prevention and control of HIV will contribute to decreasing TB.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacNeil, Adam; Glaziou, Philippe; Sismanidis, Charalambos; Date, Anand; Maloney, Susan; Floyd, Katherine","journal":"MMWR.

Herein, we describe a case of a gastric GCT diagnosed preoperatively by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) and successfully resected by single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). CASE PRESENTATION A 46-year-old Japanese woman had a tumor located in the angle of the stomach that was approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a submucosal tumor (SMT), which was finally diagnosed as a gastric GCT using EUS-FNAB. The tumor was not identified by CT 1 year and 4 months before diagnosis; therefore, because there was a possibility that the tumor was malignant, we performed surgical wedge resection using SILS. The patient had an uneventful recovery postoperatively and was discharged without complications 3 days after surgery. The tumor was pathologically diagnosed as a benign GCT that remained within the muscular layer. No recurrence or complications have occurred in the first 16 months since the surgery. CONCLUSION Because gastric GCTs are generally benign and are rarely associated with lymph node metastasis, SILS seems to be a safe and feasible surgical approach for treating GCTs.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yasuda, Atsushi; Yasuda, Takushi; Imamoto, Haruhiko; Hiraki, Yoko; Momose, Kohta; Kato, Hiroaki; Iwama, Mitsuru; Shiraishi, Osamu; Shinkai, Masayuki; Imano, Motohiro; Kimura, Yutaka","journal":"Surgical case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-020-00809-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32107653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SILS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["benign GCT","SILS","submucosal tumor","gastric GCTs","EUS-FNAB","complications","months","single-incision laparoscopic surgery","CASE PRESENTATION","feasible surgical approach","surgical wedge resection","fine needle aspiration biopsy","endoscopic ultrasound","year-old Japanese woman","BACKGROUND Granular cell tumors","gastrointestinal tract","Abdominal computed tomography","lymph node metastasis","CONCLUSION","uneventful recovery","muscular layer","patient","diagnosis","angle","SMT","possibility","days","stomach","recurrence","diameter"],"language":"en"},

Objective To investigate the association between ACEIs/ARBs and severity of illness and mortality in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective, single-center case series of the 1178 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 15 to March 15, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and drug therapy data were analyzed in all patients. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs was compared between those with severe vs nonsevere illness and between survivors vs nonsurvivors. Results Of the 1178 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.5 years (interquartile range, 38-67 years) and 545 (46.3%) were men. The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%. There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs.

Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs. Conclusions and Relevance This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients. These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Juyi; Wang, Xiufang; Chen, Jian; Zhang, Hongmei; Deng, Aiping","journal":"JAMA cardiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32324209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hypertension","ARBs","hospitalized patients","ACEIs","percentage of patients","mortality of COVID","Measures COVID","years","hospital mortality","clinical data","Importance Data","risk of mortality","survivors vs nonsurvivors","severity of illness","severe vs nonsevere illness","nonsevere infections","drug therapy data","median age","association","data support current guidelines","interquartile range","Central Hospital of Wuhan","Main Outcomes","angiotensin receptor blockers","Participants Retrospective","real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","societal recommendations","single-center case series","laboratory","hospitalization","study","enzyme inhibitors","coronavirus disease","Setting","Relevance","total group","Design","Conclusions","China","Similar findings","Objective","pandemic","Results"],"language":"en"},

Severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients have abnormal blood coagulation function, but their venous thromboembolism(VTE) prevalence is still rarely mentioned. OBJECTIVES To determine the incidence of VTE in patients with severe NCP. METHODS In this study, 81 severe NCP patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) were enrolled. The results of conventional coagulation parameters and lower limb vein ultrasonography of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS The incidence of VTE in these patients was 25%(20/81), of which 8 patients with VTE events died. VTE group was different from non-VTE group in age, lymphocytes counts, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, etc. If 1.5 \u00B5g/mL was used as the D-dimer cut-off value to predicting VTE, the sensitivity was 85.0%, the specificity was 88.5% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 94.7%. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of VTE in patients with severe NCP is 25% (20/81), which may be related to poor prognosis. The significant increase of D-dimer in severe NCP patients is a good index for identifying high-risk groups of VTE.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Songping; Chen, Shuo; Li, Xiunan; Liu, Shi; Wang, Feng","journal":"Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VTE","NCP"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe NCP patients","incidence of VTE","VTE events","non-VTE group","high-risk groups of VTE","Severe novel coronavirus pneumonia","D-dimer cut-off value","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Wuhan","China","significant increase of D","results of conventional coagulation parameters","negative predictive value","abnormal blood coagulation function","lymphocytes","lower limb vein ultrasonography","Intensive Care Unit","good index","ICU","age","Union Hospital","venous thromboembolism","partial thromboplastin time","months","APTT","SARS-CoV","study","NPV","prevalence","sensitivity","CONCLUSIONS","specificity","BACKGROUND","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","poor prognosis","\u00B5g","world"],"language":"en"},

A significant number of elderly patients require hospitalization and develop serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the preliminary impact (8 weeks) of CoVID-19, focusing on proximal femur fractures, analyzing data and results compared to the same period of 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS From February 22nd to April 18th, 2020 we surgically treated 121 proximal femur fractures (61 in Piacenza; 60 in Parma, 16 male, 44 female, mean age 81.1). In the same period of 2019, we treated 169 proximal femur fractures (90 in Piacenza, 33 male, 57 female, mean age 81.9; 79 in Parma, 29 males, 50 female, mean age 80.2). We had 21/61 (34.4%) patients resulted positive for COVID-19 and 11/61 in Parma (18.3%), based on nasal-pharyngeal swab, chest CT scan and/or lung US findings. RESULTS The incidence of proximal femur fractures had a significant reduction during CoVID-19 spread in Piacenza and Parma. Authors have noticed an elevated number of deaths within 21 days after surgery. Piacenza: 4 cases in 2019 (4.4%) and 11 in 2020 (18.0%), of which 9 cases CoVID positive. In Parma in 2019 two deaths were encountered; in 2020 6 patients died and 5 cases were CoVID positive. CONCLUSION In the first two months of the Italian epidemic, in the cities of Piacenza and Parma over 80% of deaths have occurred in patients over 70 years old. Even if preliminary, our study shows a significant increase in death in elderly patients surgically treated for proximal femur fractures, particularly in the Piacenza Hospital.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maniscalco, Pietro; Poggiali, Erika; Quattrini, Fabrizio; Ciatti, Corrado; Magnacavallo, Andrea; Vercelli, Andrea; Domenichini, Marco; Vaienti, Enrico; Pogliacomi, Francesco; Ceccarelli, Francesco","journal":"Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i2.9636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Piacenza"],"locations":["Parma"],"keyphrases":["Parma","incidence of proximal femur fractures","cases CoVID positive","cities of Piacenza","INTRODUCTION CoVID","Piacenza Hospital","significant number of elderly patients","female","mean age","millions of deaths","elevated number of deaths","significant reduction","significant increase","study","results","period","preliminary impact","chest CT scan","hospitalization","Coronavirus disease","nasal-pharyngeal swab","spread","worldwide infection","lung US findings","days","males","data","Italian epidemic","months","weeks","life-threatening complications","Authors","surgery","years old","MATERIALS","METHODS","CONCLUSION","aim"],"language":"en"},

This investigative study was conducted to determine the AGIQ metabolite(s) responsible for the discoloration. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered dietary AGIQ at doses of 0%, 1.5%, 3.0%, or 5.0% (0, 1735.0, 3480.8, and 5873.7 mg/kg/day, respectively) for 14 days, followed by a 14- or 28-day recovery period. Measurements of quercetin in urine and quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, kaempferol, and 3-o-methylquercetin metabolites of AGIQ in bone (femur), white and brown fat, and cerebrum samples were conducted following the exposure period and each recovery period. Gross examination of the femur revealed yellow discoloration that increased in intensity with dose and was still present in a dose-related manner following both recovery periods. Quercetin, at levels correlating with AGIQ dose, was measured in the urine following the 14-day exposure period and, at lower concentrations, 14 or 28 days following cessation of AGIQ exposure. All four metabolites were present in a dose-dependent manner in the femur following 14 days of dietary exposure; only quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, and 3-o-methylquercetin were present during the recovery periods. Quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, and 3-o-methylquercetin were detected in white fat (along with kaempferol), brown fat (excluding quercetin due to analytical interference), and cerebrum samples, indicating systemic availability of the metabolites.

In the literature, there is no review about sexual dysfunction and satisfaction in OCD. The current paper presents the protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize data (1) comparing the presence of sexual dysfunction between groups with OCD and non-clinical groups, (2) investigating prevalence of each one of the sexual dysfunctions in patients with OCD, (3) comparing risk for sexual dysfunction in OCD groups with the prevalence in control groups, (4) comparing sexual satisfaction between OCD groups and non-clinical groups, and (5) investigating moderators of sexual dysfunction in OCD groups as compared with control groups. Gender, age, marital status, OCD symptom severity and subtypes, comorbid depressive disorders, comorbid anxiety disorders, concurrent psychiatric medications, comorbid general medical disease, and study quality will be investigated as moderators. METHODS The protocol is reported according to PRISMA-P guidelines. The search will be conducted by independent reviewers during the second week of December 2019 by using electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library), by contacting the authors of the included studies to identify further data, by examining the references of the included studies, and by handsearching conference proceedings and theses/doctoral dissertations. The study quality will be independently evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Random-effect meta-analyses will be computed. If there is insufficient data for a specific outcome, only a systematic review will be performed. DISCUSSION This review may support clinical practice highlighting the importance of the assessment of sexuality in patients with OCD and suggesting the use of therapeutic strategies dedicated to sexuality in this clinical population with the aim of improving patients\u0027 quality of life. Potential limitations will regard the heterogeneity of the studies in terms of the instruments used to assess sexual dysfunction/satisfaction and of the definitions used to conceptualize sexual dysfunction.

We report on a case of a 35-year old renal transplant recipient who suffered from a severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical course was complicated by extreme over-exposure to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus, following co-administration of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options. However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy.

STUDY DESIGN Case series, retrospective chart review. SETTING Institutional microvascular database. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Subjects who underwent forearm free flaps and FTSGs for donor site reconstruction from April 2016 to November 2017 were included. FTSGs were obtained from the donor forearm with a proximal S-shaped incision, thereby avoiding additional wound creation. Morbidity outcomes were compared to 68 consecutive patients with STSG reconstruction from January 2009 to May 2010. Complications, including tendon exposure, subjective functional impairment, complete graft loss, partial graft loss, infection, paresthesias, and hematoma/seroma, were evaluated, as were aesthetic outcomes. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients underwent FTSG reconstruction. No significant differences between FTSGs and STSGs were demonstrated in terms of graft loss \u226540% (4% vs 4%, P = 1.000), partial graft loss (\u003C40%) (29% vs 40%, P = .207), tendon exposure (9% vs 12%, P = .573), infection (15% vs 13%, P = .805), paresthesias (12% vs 7%, P = .382), subjective functional impairment (0% vs 2%, P = .316), or hematoma/seroma (2% vs 0%, P = .316). Aesthetic outcomes were better in the FTSG group compared to the STSG group, as determined by both patients (P = .004) and surgeon (P \u003C .001). CONCLUSIONS Our results advocate for the consideration of FTSGs in the reconstruction of the forearm free flap donor site given superior aesthetic results without additional donor site morbidity or additional wound creation when compared to STSGs.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krane, Natalie A; Mowery, Alia; Azzi, James; Petrisor, Daniel; Wax, Mark K","journal":"Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599819901124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986974/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["STSG","FTSG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vs","donor site reconstruction","donor forearm","aesthetic outcomes","additional donor site morbidity","forearm free flap donor site","FTSG reconstruction","STSG reconstruction","Morbidity outcomes","partial graft loss","complete graft loss","terms of graft loss","STSGs","consideration of FTSGs","forearm free flaps","superior aesthetic results","additional wound creation","subjective functional impairment","tendon exposure","FTSG group","paresthesias","infection","STSG group","consecutive patients","hematoma","seroma","split-thickness skin grafts","METHODS Subjects","STUDY DESIGN Case series","retrospective chart review","proximal S-shaped incision","Complications","significant differences","OBJECTIVE","Institutional microvascular database","CONCLUSIONS","surgeon"],"language":"en"},

A scoping review of physical activity messaging.","doi":"10.1186/s12966-020-00954-3","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32295613","license":"unk","abstract":"BACKGROUND Understanding how to create and deliver effective physical activity (PA) messages for and to various population subgroups may play a role in increasing population PA levels. This scoping review aimed to provide an overview of what is known about PA messaging and highlight key research gaps. METHODS We followed a 5-stage protocol proposed by Arksey \u0026 O\u0027Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews checklist. Stage 1: research questions were identified. Stage 2: we identified relevant studies by searching electronic databases, contacting existing networks and hand searching reference lists. Stage 3: studies were screened in Covidence\u2122 software. Stage 4: study data were extracted and charted. Stage 5: findings from included studies were collated, summarised and reported in two ways: (1) a descriptive numerical analysis providing insight into extent, nature and distribution of the included studies, and (2) a narrative summary summarizing the evidence reviewed organised by messaging concepts and by population subgroup. RESULTS A total of 9525 references were imported into Covidence\u2122 for screening. Of these, 123 studies were included in final analysis. We found that PA messaging evidence is complex and multidimensional in nature, with numerous concepts to consider when creating or evaluating messages. The extent to which these different PA messaging concepts have been researched is variable. Where research has accumulated and evidence is consistent, it supports the following: (1) PA messages should be framed positively and highlight short-term outcomes specifically relating to social and mental health, (2) message content should be tailored or targeted to intended recipient(s), and (3) when developing messages, formative research, psychological theory and/or social marketing principles should be used. CONCLUSION While it is unlikely to address global inactivity on its own, PA messaging may play a valuable role improving population PA levels. However, it is a complex and multidimensional concept and greater understanding is still needed. We present a synthesis of the existing evidence, highlighting key areas where evidence has accumulated and where gaps lie, as well as recommendations for PA messaging to different population subgroups.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Williamson, Chlo\u00EB; Baker, Graham; Mutrie, Nanette; Niven, Ailsa; Kelly, Paul","journal":"The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12966-020-00954-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PA","Arksey \u0026 O\u0027Malley"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PA messaging evidence","PA messages","different PA messaging concepts","increasing population PA levels","included studies","existing evidence","stage protocol","different population subgroups","relevant studies","various population subgroups","key research gaps","formative research","research questions","nature","extent","numerous concepts","Covidence","scoping reviews checklist","Systematic Reviews","valuable role","existing networks","multidimensional concept","key areas","greater understanding","final analysis","BACKGROUND Understanding","descriptive numerical analysis","social marketing principles","PRISMA","Meta-Analyses","Preferred Reporting Items","psychological theory","extension","O\u0027Malley","insight","electronic databases","hand","Arksey","distribution","recommendations","effective physical activity","mental health","reference lists","global inactivity","narrative summary","study data","overview","following","message content","short-term outcomes","references","software","synthesis","findings","recipient","total","CONCLUSION","ways","screening","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We evaluated the association between CSF levels of 18 cytokines, previously found to be associated to grey matter damage, and the disease activity, among 99 relapsing-remitting MS patients, who underwent blinded clinical and 3T-MRI evaluations for 4 years. Groups with (EDA) or without (NEDA) evidence of disease activity (occurrence of relapses, new white matter lesions, EDSS change) were identified. Cortical lesions and the annualized cortical thinning were also evaluated. RESULTS Fortyone patients experienced EDA and, compared to the NEDA group, had at diagnosis higher CSF levels of CXCL13, CXCL12, IFN\u03B3, TNF, sCD163, LIGHT and APRIL (p\u003C0.001). In the multivariate analysis, CXCL13 (HR=1.35, p=0.0002), LIGHT (HR=1.22, p=0.005) and APRIL (HR=1.78, p=0.0001) were the CSF molecules more strongly associated with the risk of EDA. The model including CSF variables predicted more accurately the occurrence of disease activity than the model with only clinical/MRI parameters (C-index at 4 years= 71% vs 44%). Finally, higher CSF levels of CXCL13 (\u03B2=4.7*10-4 ,p\u003C0.001), TNF (\u03B2=3.1*10-3 ,p=0.004), LIGHT (\u03B2=2.6*10-4 ,p=0.003), sCD163 (\u03B2=4.3*10-3 ,p=0.009) and TWEAK (\u03B2=3.4*10-3 ,p=0.024) were associated with more severe cortical thinning. INTERPRETATION A specific CSF profile, mainly characterized by elevated levels of B-cell related cytokines, distinguishes patients at high risk of disease activity and severe cortical damage.

The virus seems to has propensity to infect older male individuals with underlying disease. The clinical features were on a large scale that varies from being an asymptomatic carrier to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms. Not only, the disease seems to be rare and have a milder course in pediatric age but also respiratory failure, multiorgan dysfunction, and death are extremely rare. Although several comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are defined as a risk factor for developing the acute respiratory syndrome and need for intensive care; immune-compromised situations such as rheumatic disease which require immunosuppressive treatment strikingly are not found to be a risk factor for more severe disease course.

In this report, we compare COVID-19 death counts to seasonal influenza death counts in New York City during the interval from February 1 - April 18, 2020. Using this approach, COVID-19 appears to have caused 21.4 times the number of deaths as seasonal influenza during the same period. We also assessed excess mortality in order to verify this finding. New York City has had approximately 13,032 excess all-cause mortality deaths during this time period. We assume that most of these deaths are COVID-19 related. We therefore calculated the ratio of excess deaths (i.e. assumed COVID-19 deaths) to seasonal influenza deaths during the same time interval and found a similar ratio of 21.1 COVID-19 to seasonal influenza deaths. Our findings are consistent with conditions on the ground today.

We determined the burden of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in persons residing in United States (US) who are at risk for severe COVID-19 infection. Methods Age (60 years or greater), presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, mellitus, hypertension, and/or malignancy were used to identify persons at risk for admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death with COVID-19 infection. Persons were classified as low risk (no risk factors), moderate risk (1 risk factor), and high risk (two or more risk factors present) using nationally representative sample of US adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017 and 2018 survey. Results Among a total of 5856 participants, 2386 (40.7%) were considered low risk, 1325 (22.6%) moderate risk, and 2145 persons (36.6%) as high risk for severe COVID-19 infection.

Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 \u2103 prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 \u2103 for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56 \u2103 for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. METHODS: The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. FINDINGS: The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. INTERPRETATION: Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Zeliang; Zhang, Qi; Lu, Yi; Zhang, Xi; Zhang, Wenjun; Guo, Cheng; Liao, Conghui; Li, Qianlin; Han, Xiaohu; Lu, Jiahai","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eec5b4ce2de8d9d00be664e6af79cac476991bbf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021824","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Baidu Qianxi"],"locations":["China","South China","Wuhan City"],"keyphrases":["cities of Hubei province","low case number","nCoV pneumonia cases","case numbers of different provinces","Numbers of cases","highest number of cases","Yunnan provinces","Case distribution","Population migration data of Wuhan City","exponential growth of case number","provinces of South China","city lockdown","pneumonia outbreak","time risks","Hot spot provinces","population emigration","correlation","emigrated populations","early epidemic","great importance","early warning","great significance","different regions","trends of risks","main infection source","prevention of future outbreak","source of virus spreaders","Sichuan","implementation of nationwide control measures","upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave","preparedness","ongoing new coronavirus","individuals","Baidu Qianxi","rapid increase","BACKGROUNDS","location information","institutions","ArcGIS","millions of people","FINDINGS","INTERPRETATION","WinBUGS","peak","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis and modeling. We used the daily reports of definitive COVID-19 patients (sampling of severe cases and hospitalization) released by Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Epidemic projection models of Gompertz, Von Bertalanffy and least squared error (LSE) were used to predict the number of cases at April 3, 2020 until May 13, 2020. Results: R0 in Iran was estimated to be 4.7 that has now fallen to below 2. Given the three different scenarios, the prediction of the patients on April 3, 2020 by Von Bertalanffy, Gompertz and LSE were estimated at 48200, 52500 and 58000, respectively. The number of deceased COVID-19 patients was also estimated to be 3600 individuals using the Von growth model, 4200 ones by Gompertz\u0027s model and 4850 ones according to the LSE method. To predict and estimate the number of patients and deaths in the end of epidemic based on Von and Gompertz models, we will have 87000 cases, 4900 and 11000 deaths until 13 May and 1 June, respectively. Conclusion: The process of controlling the epidemic is tangible. If enforcement and public behavior interventions continue with current trends, the control and reduction of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran will be flat from April 28, until July, 2020 and new cases are expected to decline from the following Iranian new year.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmadi, Ali; Fadaei, Yasin; Shirani, Majid; Rahmani, Fereydoon","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc59332e35f3611f4835636817b7cdcde0478e0e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037671","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Von Bertalanffy"],"organizations":["Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education","LSE"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["prediction of COVID","number of patients","number of cases","epidemic trend","end of epidemic","number of deceased COVID","new cases","Epidemic projection models of Gompertz","Gompertz models","Iran Ministry of Health","ones","Bertalanffy","daily reports of definitive COVID","sampling of severe cases","study","deaths","LSE method","Gompertz\u0027s model","precise data","growth model","secondary data analysis","following Iranian new year","current trends","public behavior interventions","hospitalization","reduction","emerging disease","Medical Education","control","squared error","enforcement","modeling","process","world","different scenarios","Methods","individuals","Results","R0","Conclusion","Background"],"language":"en"},

There are widespread reports of dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), which are paramount to protect frontline medical/nursing staff and to minimize further spread of the virus. We carried out a rapid review to summarize the existing evidence on SARS-CoV-2 survivorship and methods to disinfect PPE gear, particularly N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR). In the absence of data on SARS-CoV-2, we focused on the sister virus SARS-CoV-1. We propose a two-step disinfection process, which is conservative in the absence of robust evidence on SARS-CoV-2. This disinfection protocol is based on an initial storage of PPE for \u22654 days, followed by ultraviolet light (UVC), dry heat treatment, or chemical disinfection. Importantly, each of the two steps is based on independent disinfection mechanisms, so that our proposed protocol is a multiplicative system, maximising the efficacy of our disinfection process. This method could be rapidly implemented in other healthcare settings, while testing of each method is undertaken, increasing the frontline supply of PPE, and avoiding many of the upstream issues of supply chain disruption currently being faced.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Derraik, Jos\u00E9 G B; Anderson, William A; Connelly, Elisabeth A; Anderson, Yvonne C","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be4df7a03de718c39fb660583a9be8accc895398.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051409","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disinfection protocol","sister virus SARS-CoV","chemical disinfection","frontline supply of PPE","two-step disinfection process","PPE gear","independent disinfection mechanisms","initial storage of PPE","absence of robust evidence","existing evidence","proposed protocol","absence of data","upstream issues of supply chain disruption","dry heat treatment","N95 filtering facepiece respirators","widespread reports of dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment","UVC","survivorship","ultraviolet light","FFR","multiplicative system","days","efficacy","methods","nursing staff","rapid review","steps","hospitals","pandemic","COVID","healthcare settings","capacity"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to determine whether influenza diagnoses masked early COVID-19 cases and, if so, estimate numbers of undetected COVID-19 cases in a large database of primary-care records covering \u003E6 million people in Catalonia. Design: Time-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases, using all influenza seasons from autumn-winter 2010-2011 to autumn-winter 2019-2020. Setting: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain. Participants: People registered in one of the contributing primary-care practices, covering \u003E6 million people and \u003E85% of the population. Main outcome measures: Weekly new cases of influenza and COVID-19 diagnosed in primary care. Analyses: Daily counts of both cases were computed using the total cases recorded over the previous 7 days to avoid weekly effects on recording practice. Epidemic curves were characterised for the 2010-2011 to 2019-2020 influenza seasons. Influenza seasons with a similar epidemic curve and peak case number as the 2019-2020 season were used to model predictions for 2019-2020. ARIMA models were fitted to the included influenza seasons, overall and stratified by age, to estimate expected case numbers. Daily excess influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases. Results: Four influenza season curves (2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2016-2017) were used to estimate the number of expected cases of influenza in 2019-2020. Between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 20202, 8,017 (95% CI: 1,841 to 14,718) excess influenza cases were identified. This excess was highest in the 15-64 age group. Conclusions: COVID-19 cases may have been present in the Catalan population when the first imported case was reported on 25 February 2020. COVID-19 carriers may have been misclassified as influenza diagnoses in primary care, boosting community transmission before public health measures were taken. In future, the surveillance of excess influenza cases using widely available primary-care electronic medical records could help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 or other influenza-like illness-causing pathogens. Earlier detection would allow public health responses to be initiated earlier than during the current crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coma, Ermengol; Mora, Nuria; Prats-Uribe, Albert; Fina, Francesc; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Medina-Peralta, Manuel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2d1730bcfc816f1a5f524e7974cbaaa83e58d0b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20056259","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARIMA"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["cases of COVID","Daily excess influenza cases","number of expected cases of influenza","influenza diagnoses","surveillance of excess influenza cases","Weekly new cases of influenza","total cases","included influenza seasons","Primary care","influenza season curves","early COVID","Time-series study of influenza","care records","new outbreaks of COVID","numbers of undetected COVID","available primary","contributing primary-care practices","people","large database of primary","expected case numbers","peak case number","public health measures","imported case","Epidemic curves","Spain","Catalonia","autumn-winter","public health responses","weekly effects","Daily counts","Earlier detection","age group","Catalan population","electronic medical records","similar epidemic curve","Main outcome measures","community transmission","days","recording practice","Design","asymptomatic patients","Analyses","Results","future","Setting","ARIMA models","virus","uncertainty","illness","pathogens","Conclusions","carriers","current crisis","Objectives","predictions","Participants"],"language":"en"},

Summary Introduction In recent years, developments in virological tools have led to the easy detection of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses (E/RV). Their detection is very frequent in cases of airway involvement in children and their demonstrated causality. But the morbidity of E/RV in the neonatal period is unknown due to lack of epidemiological data. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical characteristics of these infections in hospitalized neonates. Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed the virology specimens of all neonates hospitalized at the Caen University Hospital between 2006 and 2011. Clinical characteristics were obtained from the charts. Results During the study period, 4544 infants aged less than 28 days were hospitalized: 4159 in the neonatal ward and 385 in the pediatric ward. Among these, 711 virology specimens were available, 31 % of which identified at least one virus. An E/RV was identified in 87 patients (1.9 % of the neonates admitted during the study period): 52 in the pediatric ward (13.5 % of 385), and 35 in the neonatal ward (0.8 % of 4159). The mean gestational age was 39 weeks in the pediatric cohort and 35 weeks in the neonatal cohort. The main indication for virological analysis was persistent drowsiness (28 %), temperature above 38\u00B0C (25 %), an apparently life-threatening event (23 %), bradycardia (20.5 %), and pallor (20.5 %). Respiratory symptoms associated with E/RV infection were coryza (74 %), cough (35 %), hypoxemia (32 %), accessory muscle use, and recession (31 %). Digestive symptoms were poor feeding (59 %), regurgitation (38 %), abdominal distension (24 %), and projectile vomiting (17 %). Twenty-three percent of the patients required admission to the neonatal ICU or pediatric ICU. Respiratory treatments included oxygen (24 % of 87 patients), continuous positive airway pressure (11 %), and ventilation (5 %). Antibiotics were prescribed in 41 % of the patients (46), but only 10 % (9) had an identified concomitant bacterial infection. In the neonatal department, nosocomial acquisition was suspected in 50 % of E/RV infections. Conclusion E/RV infections have a significant morbidity in neonates, and nosocomial transmission of the virus is underestimated. We recommend that respiratory viruses, including E/RV, be tested for in any unexplained signs in a neonate. Better identification of viruses might shorten the duration of unnecessary antibiotics.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zacharie, S.; Vabret, A.; Guillois, B.; Dupont, C.; Brouard, J.","journal":"Archives de P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc3bcd7a36188079b263d68d9dbbab42e0568ce2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X1730249X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X1730249X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Caen University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infections E","The objective","in the neonatal ward","in the pediatric ward","RV in the neonatal period is unknown","enfants","But the morbidity","these infections in hospitalized neonates","led to the easy detection","Results During the study period","Clinical characteristics were obtained from the charts","p\u00E9riode n\u00E9onatale","identification virale rapide","identification virale positive","this study was to evaluate the incidence","developments in virological tools","airway involvement in children","neonates hospitalized at the Caen University Hospital between","methods We retrospectively analyzed the virology specimens","Summary Introduction In recent years","infections n\u00E9onatales","morbidit\u00E9 n\u00E9onatale","terme moyen","Their detection is very frequent in cases","days were hospitalized","tels r\u00E9sultats virologiques","to lack","virology specimens were available","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements","ann\u00E9es de r\u00E9sultats virologiques issus","terme \u00E2g\u00E9s","semaines","p\u00E9diatrie m\u00E9dicale","jours","virus respiratoires","symptomatologie respiratoire","service de n\u00E9onatologie","fr\u00E9quence globale","antibioth\u00E9rapie","Among these","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Introduction","diagnostic virologique","acquisition nosocomiale","morbidit\u00E9 marqu\u00E9e","their demonstrated causality","which identified at","alt\u00E9ration clinique inexpliqu\u00E9e","expression clinique corr\u00E9l\u00E9e","estimation de la transmission nosocomiale","motifs du pr\u00E9l\u00E8vement virologique","infants aged less than","rhinoviruses","soin intensif n\u00E9onatal","r\u00E9cents d\u00E9veloppements des outils","interpr\u00E9tation","enteroviruses","manque de donn\u00E9es \u00E9pid\u00E9miologiques","Materials","m\u00E9thodes","atteintes des voies a\u00E9riennes","faveur de la recherche","r\u00E9gurgitations","charge","r\u00E9animation p\u00E9diatrique","importance","Conclusion","epidemiological","ent\u00E9rovirus","diminution des prises alimentaires","vomissements","co-infection bact\u00E9rienne","mesures de pr\u00E9vention","ballonnement abdominal","\u00E9vidence","\u00E2ge corrig\u00E9","rhinite","Mat\u00E9riel","\u00E9tude","inclusion","causalit\u00E9 d\u00E9montr\u00E9e","changement de teint inexpliqu\u00E9","d\u00E9saturation","toux","tirage","secteurs","mise","ventilation","intubation trach\u00E9ale","r\u00E9activit\u00E9 persistante","temp\u00E9rature sup\u00E9rieure","malaise brutal","oxyg\u00E9noth\u00E9rapie","jet","bradycardie","cohorte","In the neonatal department","weeks in the neonatal cohort","weeks in the pediatric cohort","RV was identified in","The main indication","the patients required admission to the neonatal ICU","in any unexplained signs in","the neonates admitted during the study period","the virus is underestimated","Antibiotics were prescribed in","The mean gestational age was","An E","nosocomial acquisition was suspected in","viruses might shorten the duration","significant morbidity in neonates","RV infections","including E","Conclusion E","RV infection were coryza","pediatric ICU","Respiratory symptoms associated with E","virological analysis was","an apparently","had an identified concomitant bacterial infection","We recommend that respiratory viruses","Digestive symptoms were poor feeding","nosocomial transmission","unnecessary antibiotics","Respiratory treatments included oxygen","be tested","Better identification","drowsiness","three","threatening event","continuous positive airway","but only","Twenty","accessory muscle","recession","hypoxemia","regurgitation","cough","abdominal distension","temperature above","projectile vomiting","bradycardia","pallor"],"language":"fr"},

Methods : We conducted an epidemiological study in which we collected COVID-19 pandemic data of April 11th, 2020 from the web site worldometers.info . The exclusion criteria for our study were a number of inhabitants less than one million, low-income countries according to the World Bank classification, a total number of infection cases less than 500 and countries that have performed less than one hundred tests per million inhabitants. Results : Countries that never had universal BCG vaccination policy have a higher mortality (correlated to performed diagnostic tests) attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection (p\u003C0.001). We found that the year of introduction of vaccination influenced significantly the mortality. Countries that started immunization policy before 1960 had more favorable results (p=0.049). For countries that started the BCG vaccination after 1960, countries with current policies have lower mortality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection than countries that have stopped immunization (p=0.047).

Diagnostic performance was computed for a system trained on CXRs of Italian subjects from two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. Methods We used for training and internal testing an ensemble of ten convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with mainly bedside CXRs of 250 COVID-19 and 250 non-COVID-19 subjects from two hospitals. We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as reference standard. Results At 10-fold cross-validation, our AI model classified COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85) and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91). For the independent dataset, AI showed 0.80 sensitivity (95% CI 0.72-0.86) (59/74), 0.81 specificity (29/36) (95% CI 0.73-0.87), and 0.81 AUC (95% CI 0.73-0.87).

The current global threat related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread social isolation. How does this situation affect dreams? Is dreaming during the pandemic related to mental suffering?

To address these questions, we applied natural language processing tools to study 210 dream reports (n=67, Pandemic group n=42, plus control group balanced for age, sex and education) either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during March-April, 2020, following the pandemic announcement by the WHO and quarantine was imposed in Brazil. Post-announcement dreams showed a higher proportion of words related to anger and sadness, and higher average semantic similarities to the terms contamination and cleanness, which tended to increase over time. These features were associated with mental suffering related to social isolation, as they explained 39% of the variance in PANSS negative subscale (p=0.0092). Besides, dream observation was positively self-evaluated and dream similarities to contamination and cleanness revealed different impacts of the dream observation effect.

Endogenous immunity in cancer patients, such as circulating anticancer antibodies or tumor-reactive B cells, has been historically yet incompletely described. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-draining (sentinel) lymph node (SN) is a rich source for tumor-reactive B cells that give rise to systemic IgG anticancer antibodies circulating in the bloodstream of breast cancer patients. Using a synergistic combination of high-throughput B-cell sequencing and quantitative immunoproteomics, we describe the prospective identification of tumor-reactive SN B cells (based on clonal frequency) and also demonstrate an unequivocal link between affinity-matured expanded B-cell clones in the SN and antitumor IgG in the blood. This technology could facilitate the discovery of antitumor antibody therapeutics and conceivably identify novel tumor antigens. Lastly, these findings highlight the unique and specialized niche the SN can fill in the advancement of cancer immunotherapy.

Outside of China, Iran has emerged as one of the most affected countries with a high death count and rate. The paper presents the first empirical evidence from Iranian adults during the Covid-19 pandemic on their level of distress and its predictors. Methods On March 25-28, 2020, a dire time for Covid-19 in Iran, we surveyed 1058 adults from all 30 provinces in Iran using the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). Findings The distress level of Iranian adults (mean: 34.54; s.d.: 14.92) was significantly higher (mean difference: 10.9; t=22.7; p\u003C0.0001; 95% CI: 10.0 to 11.8) than that of Chinese adults (mean: 23.65; s.d.: 5.45) as reported in a prior study with the same measure of Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). We also found the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China. Interpretation Our findings that the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China suggest the need to study the predictors of mental health in individual countries during the Covid-19 pandemic to effectively identify and screen for those more susceptible to mental health issues.

In some jurisdictions, over 10% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been found among healthcare workers. Aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) may increase the risk of nosocomial transmission, exacerbated by present global shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Improved methods for mitigating risk during AGMPs are therefore urgently needed. Methods The Aerosol Containment Enclosure (ACE) was constructed from acrylic with silicone gaskets for arm port seals and completed with a thin plastic sheet. Hospital wall suction generated negative pressure within the ACE. To evaluate protective capability, differential pressures were recorded under static conditions and during simulated AGMPs. Smoke flow patterns, fluorescence aerosolization, and sodium saccharin aerosolization tests were also conducted. Results Negative pressures of up to -47.7 mmH2O were obtained using the enclosure with two wall suction units (combined outflow of 70 L min-1), with inflow of O2 of 15 L min-1. Negative pressures between -10 and -35 mmH2O were maintained during simulated AGMPs, including oxygen delivery by mask, airway suctioning, bag-mask manual ventilation and endotracheal intubation of a potential COVID-19 patient. The ACE effectively contained smoke, fluorescein aerosol, and sodium saccharin aerosol within the enclosure during use. Conclusions The ACE is capable of maintaining negative pressure during simulated AGMPs. In all cases, containment was improved relative to an identical enclosure with non-occluded ports at ambient pressure. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the use of such a device may assist in reducing nosocomial infections among healthcare providers.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chahal, A.

Geographical disease surveillance is a powerful tool to monitor the spread of epidemics and pandemic, providing important information on the location of new hot-spots, assisting public health agencies to implement targeted approaches to minimize mortality. Methods County level data from January 22-April 28 was downloaded from USAfacts.org to create heat maps with ArcMapTM for diagnosed COVID-19 cases and mortality. The data was analyzed using spatial and space-time scan statistics and the SaTScanTM software, to detect geographical cluster with high incidence and mortality, adjusting for multiple testing. Analyses were adjusted for age. While the spatial clusters represent counties with unusually high counts of COVID-19 when averaged over the time period January 22-April 20, the space-time clusters allow us to identify groups of counties in which there exists a significant change over time. Results There were several statistically significant COVID-19 clusters for both incidence and mortality. Top clusters with high rates included the areas in and around New York City, New Orleans and Chicago, but there were also several small rural clusters. Top clusters for a recent surge in incidence and mortality included large parts of the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic Region, and several smaller areas in and around New York and New England. Conclusions Spatial and space-time surveillance of COVID-19 can be useful for public health departments in their efforts to minimize mortality from the disease. It can also be applied to smaller regions with more granular data.

Serology testing is important for diagnosis of infection, determining infection attack rates and immunity in the population. It also informs vaccine development. Although several serology tests are in use, improving their specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis on the one hand and for detecting past infection for population-based studies, are priorities. Methods: We evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles to 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens by cloning and expressing 15 open reading frames (ORFs) in mammalian cells and screened antibody responses to them in COVID-19 patients using the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS). Results: The LIPS technique allowed us to detect antibody responses in COVID-19 patients to 11 of the 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested, identifying novel immunogenic targets. This technique shows that antigens ORF3b and ORF8 allow detection of antibody early in infection in a specific manner and reveals the immuno-dominance of the N antigen in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Our report provides an unbiased characterization of antibody responses to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The combination of 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody LIPS assays, i.e. N, ORF3b, and ORF8, is sufficient to identify all COVID-19 patients of our cohort even at early time-points of illness, whilst Spike alone fails to do so. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of investigating new immunogens NSP1, ORF3b, ORF7a and ORF8 which may mediate immune functions other than neutralization which may be beneficial or harmful to the patient.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hachim, A.; Kavian, N.; Cohen, C.

Abstract Acute pharyngitis in adults is one of the most common infectious diseases seen in general practitioners\u2019 consultations. Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u03B2-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection. Neither are macrolides indicated as first-line therapy; they should be reserved for patients allergic to penicillin. The appropriate diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and proper use of antibiotics based on the scientific evidence available are crucial. Using management algorithms can be helpful in identifying and screening the cases that do not require antibiotic therapy.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cots, Josep M.; Al\u00F3s, Juan-Ignacio; B\u00E1rcena, Mario; Boleda, Xavier; Ca\u00F1ada, Jos\u00E9 L.; G\u00F3mez, Niceto; Mendoza, Ana; Vilaseca, Isabel; Llor, Carles","journal":"SEMERGEN - Medicina de Familia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcefb795b369f47edd3b2fd1838adef100b131ac.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1138359315000477; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1138359315000477","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Neither"],"organizations":["FAA bacteriana","rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["The aim of the treatment","the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis","The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate","one of the most common infectious","most of which","reducing the contagious","the main agent","The appropriate diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and proper","In the diagnostic process","of predictive clinical","not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection","of antibiotics based on the scientific evidence available","management algorithms that include the","resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics","FAA bacteriana","Penicillin and amoxicillin","Using management algorithms can be helpful in identifying and screening the cases that","an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs","tratamiento inicial","tratamiento antibi\u00F3tico","manejo diagn\u00F3stico","span and preventing local suppurative and non","sobrediagn\u00F3stico de FAA estreptoc\u00F3cica","Abstract Acute pharyngitis in adults","prescripci\u00F3n de antibi\u00F3ticos","antibi\u00F3ticos de elecci\u00F3n","posible etiolog\u00EDa bacteriana","seen in general practitioners","and rapid tests have been set up","not performed","Among bacterial","haemolytic streptococcus","Viral aetiology","pacientes","algoritmos de manejo","penicilina","casos","Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u03B2","not require antibiotic therapy","t\u00E9cnica de diagn\u00F3stico r\u00E1pido","they should be reserved for patients allergic","clinical assessment","macrolides indicated as first","line therapy","estreptococo \u03B2","suppurative complications","primera elecci\u00F3n","infecci\u00F3n aguda","asociaci\u00F3n de amoxicilina","faringoamigdalitis aguda","better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test","can help clinicians","consiguiente prescripci\u00F3n innecesaria","escalas de valoraci\u00F3n cl\u00EDnica","complicaciones supurativas locales","t\u00E9cnicas de detecci\u00F3n r\u00E1pida","speeding up symptom resolution","principal agente responsable","grupo","veces","uso","Consequently","buena ayuda","broad spectrum","actuaci\u00F3n","farmacias comunitarias","enfermedades infecciosas","tiempo de contagio","ant\u00EDgeno estreptoc\u00F3cico","Neither","adulto","consultations","GABHS","evidencia cient\u00EDfica disponible","If these","implantaci\u00F3n de protocolos","s\u00EDntomas","EBHGA","utilidad","amplio espectro","alergia","resoluci\u00F3n","m\u00E9dico de familia","causante","pa\u00EDs","objetivos","macr\u00F3lidos"],"language":"es"},

To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sungnak, Waradon; Huang, Ni; B\u0027ecavin, Christophe; Berg, Marijn; Network, HCA Lung Biological","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/524fe14d50687690ef9815fe8183d027d10ac849.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06122v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","Human Cell Atlas"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nasal epithelial cells","viral infection","viral entry","ciliated cells","viral transmission","viral targets","viral pathology","viral tropism","secretory cells","In-depth analysis of epithelial cells","ACE2 airway epithelial expression","skewed expression of viral receptors","nasal goblet","RNA expression","highest ACE2 expression","viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2","coronavirus disease","Human Cell Atlas consortium","coronavirus receptor","entry-associated proteins","course of infection","SARS-CoV","single-cell RNA-sequencing","specific significance of nasal epithelia","clinical implications","clinical strategies","respiratory tree","upper airway","immune pathways","antiviral genes","potential reservoirs of SARS","relevant role","scRNA-seq","healthy individuals","etiologic agent responsible","datasets","COVID","availability","compendium of data points","prevention","biological framework","reference dataset","importance","therapy","global threat","association","enhanced transmissivity","findings","turn","instance"],"language":"en"},

A better understanding of patient clinical profiles is essential to drive efficient and timely health service strategies. In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors for a higher susceptibility to symptomatic presentation with COVID-19 and a transition to severe disease. Methods: We analysed data on 2756 patients admitted to Chelsea \u0026 Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust between 1st January and 23rd April 2020. We compared differences in characteristics between patients designated positive for COVID-19 and patients designated negative on hospitalisation and derived a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19. For patients with COVID-19, we used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with progression to severe disease defined by: 1) admission to the hospital AICU, 2) the need for mechanical ventilation, 3) in-hospital mortality, and 4) at least one measurement of elevated D-dimer (equal or superior to 1,000 ug/L) indicative of increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Results: The patient population consisted of 1148 COVID-19 positive and 1608 COVID-19 negative patients. Age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, respiratory rate, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure formed the most parsimonious model for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19 at hospital admission. Among 1148 patients with COVID-19, 116 (10.1%) were admitted to the AICU, 71 (6.2%) required mechanical ventilation, 368 (32.1%) had at least one record of D-dimer levels [\u2265]1,000 g/L, and 118 patients died. In the multivariable logistic regression, age (OR = 0.953 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.937-0.968) C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007), and white blood cell counts (OR = 1.059 per 109/L, 95% CI: 1.010-1.111) were found to be associated with admission to the AICU. Age (OR = 0.973 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.955-0.990), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.003 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006) and sodium (OR = 0.915 per 1 mmol/L, 0.868-0.962) were associated with mechanical ventilation. Age (OR = 1.023 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.004-1.043), CRP (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.006), and body temperature (OR = 0.723 per 1oC, 95% CI: 0.541-0.958) were associated with elevated D-dimer. For mortality, we observed associations with age (OR = 1.060 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.040-1.082), female sex (OR = 0.442, 95% CI: 0.442, 95% CI: 0.245-0.777), Asian ethnic background (OR = 2.237 vs White ethnic background, 95% CI: 1.111-4.510), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg/L, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006), sodium (OR = 1.038 per 1 mmol/L, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006), and respiratory rate (OR = 1.054 per 1 breath/min, 95% CI: 1.024-1.087). Conclusion: Our analysis suggests there are several demographic, clinical and laboratory findings associated with a symptomatic presentation of COVID-19. Moreover, significant associations between patient deterioration were found with age, sex and specific blood markers, chiefly C-reactive protein, and could help early identification of patients at risk of poorer prognosis.

The most affected European countries are, so far, Italy and Spain. In both countries (and others), the authorities decreed a lockdown, with local specificities. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. Method: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports. Results: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented. Differences in the basic reproduction ratio are also very significant, dropping from de 5.89 (95% CI: 5.46-7.09) before the lockdown to 0.48 (95% CI: 0.15-1.17) afterwards. Conclusions: Handling a pandemic like Covid-19 is very complex and requires quick decision making. The large differences found in the speed of propagation of the disease show us that being able to implement interventions at the earliest stage is crucial to minimise the impact of a potential infectious threat.

Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort investigation of lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients in King County, WA who received 9-1-1 EMS responses from February 14, 2020 to March 26, 2020. We reviewed dispatch, EMS, and public health surveillance records to evaluate the temporal relationship between exposure and programmatic changes to EMS operations designed to identify high-risk patients, protect the workforce, and conserve PPE. Results There were 274 EMS encounters for 220 unique COVID-19 patients involving 700 unique EMS providers with 988 EMS person-encounters. Use of full PPE including mask, eye protection, gown and gloves (MEGG) was 67%. There were 151 person-exposures among 129 individuals, who required 981 quarantine days.

CT imaging in 4 out of 5 patients was in favor of COVID-19. The median of door-to-device time was reduced 13 minutes during this outbreak (p :0.007). In-hospital mortality before and during outbreak was 3.22% and 5.19%, respectively (p: 0.57). Confirmed infection with COVID-19 was only reported in one of expired cases. The difference in 15-day MACE between two time periods was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Given that 15-day outcome in acute STEMI patients is not affected by COVID-19 outbreak, we did not find it reasonable to change our protocol. However, further studies are needed to determine a standard protocol for emergency management","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salarifar, M.; Ghavami, M.; Poorhosseini, H.; Masoudkabir, F.; Jenab, Y.; Amirzadegan, A.; Alidoosti, M.; Aghajani, H.; Bozorgi, A.; Hosseini, K.; Lotfi-Tokaldany, M.; Mortazavi, S.

We analyze the model using available data to find the infection-free, endemic/infection steady states and the basic reproduction number. In addition, a sensitivity analysis done shows that the transmission rate and the rate at which persons acquire the virus, have a positive influence on the basic reproduction number.

Since the first observations of COVID-19 patients, significant hypoalbuminemia was detected. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19 patients is due to pulmonary capillary leakage and to test its correlation with indicators of respiratory function. Methods: 174 COVID-19 patients, 92 admitted to the Intermediate Medicine ward (IMW), and 82 to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan were included in this study. Findings: Serum albumin concentration was decreased in the whole cohort, with ICU patients displaying lower values than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g/L, p\u003C0.0001]. Lower albumin values were found in patients belonging to a more compromised group (lower PaO2 to FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings). In a subset of 26 patients, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) highlighted high protein concentrations, which were correlated to Interleukin-8 and Interleukin-10 BALF concentration. The length of hospitalisation [20 (15-29) vs 8 (5-14) days, p\u003C0.0001] and death rate (52.4% vs 21.7%, p\u003C0.0001) were higher in ICU than in IMW patients, while a strict relation between hypoalbuminemia and 30 day-survival was detected in the whole cohort. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten autopsy lung tissues showed diffuse loosening of interendothelial junctional complex. Interpretation: The degree of hypoalbuminemia can be considered as a useful severity marker in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary capillary leak syndrome secondary to the hyperinflammatory state plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 respiratory dysfunction and should be regarded as a therapeutic target.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, M.

Methods The provinces that reported more than 500 cases of COVID\u221219 till February 18, 2020 were selected as the major endemic area. The Verhulst model was used to fit the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases. The R0 of COVID\u221219 was calculated using the parameters of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID\u221219, respectively. The latent class of R0 was analyzed using a latent profile analysis model. Results The median R0 calculated from SARS and COVID\u221219 parameters were 1.84 \u2212 3.18 and 1.74 \u2212 2.91, respectively. The R0 calculated from the SARS parameters was greater than that of calculated from the COVID\u221219 parameters (Z = \u22124.782 \u2212 \u22124.623, P \u003C 0.01). Both R0 can be divided into three latent classes. The initial value of R0 in class 1 (Shandong Province, Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality) was relatively low and decreases slowly. The initial value of R0 in class 2 (Anhui Province, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, Henan Province, Zhejiang Province, Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province) was relatively high and decreases rapidly.

The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less dangerous. The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the peripheral airways. Coughing into a tissue or cloth even at home in order to absorb the emitted aerosol is highly recommended to avoid the continuous re-inhalation of own cough.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madas, B.

Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the state of the disease based on existing data. Building on the generic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework we incorporate two behavioral and logistical considerations. First we capture the endogenous changes in contact rate (average contact per person) as more death are reported. As a result the reproduction number changes endogenously in the model. Second we differentiate reported and true cases by including simple formulations for how only a fraction of cases might be diagnosed, and how that fraction changes in response to epidemic\u0027s progression. In estimating the model we use both the official data as well as the discovered infected travelers and unofficial medical community estimates and triangulate these sources to build a more complete picture. Calibration is completed by forming a likelihood function for observing the actual time series data conditional on model parameters, and conducting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model is used to estimate current \u0022true\u0022 cases of infection and death. We analyze the future trajectory of the disease under six conditions related to the seasonal effects and policy measures targeting social distancing. Findings: The model closely replicates the past data but also shows the true number of cases is likely far larger. We estimate about 493,000 current infected cases (90% CI: 271K-810K) as of March 20th, 2020. Our estimate for cumulative cases of infection until that date is 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M), and for total death is 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K). These numbers are significantly (more than one order of magnitude) higher than official statistics. The trajectory of the epidemic until the end of June could take various paths depending on the impact of seasonality and policies targeting social distancing. In the most optimistic scenario for seasonal effects, depending on policy measures, 1.6 million Iranians (90% CI: 0.9M-2.6M) are likely to get infected, and death toll will reach about 58,000 cases (90% CI: 32K-97K), while in the more pessimistic scenarios, death toll may exceed 103,000 cases (90% CI: 56K-172K). Implication: Our results suggest that the number of cases and deaths may be over an order of magnitude larger than official statistics in Iran. Absent extended testing capacity other countries may face a significant under-count of existing cases and thus be caught off guard about the actual toll of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghaffarzadegan, Navid; Rahmandad, Hazhir","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fc5673f28c97b5f69dd9c2f2c7536552e98018d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040956","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Markov Chain Monte Carlo"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["true cases","fraction of cases","majority of cases","official data","true number of cases","current infected cases","cumulative cases of infection","limited data","existing data","spread of disease","past data","official statistics","death toll","burden of disease","model parameters","significant under-count of existing cases","simple dynamic model","state","total death","actual time series data conditional","fraction changes","actual toll","reproduction number changes","various countries","seasonal effects","discovered infected travelers","policy measures","global community","endogenous changes","order of magnitude larger","social distancing","future trajectory","contact rate","average contact","real-time","under-estimation","various paths","simple formulations","global pandemic","future trajectories","reliable picture","complete picture","delayed testing procedures","limited screening resources","unofficial medical community estimates","Absent extended testing capacity","symptoms similar","impact of seasonality","unprecedented challenges","person","Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations","policies","likelihood function","response","epidemic\u0027s progression","emerging outbreak","planning","conditions","coherent view","date","modeling","framework","optimistic scenario","pessimistic scenarios","Iranians","results","deaths","guard","logistical considerations","generic SEIR","Background","Coronavirus","COVID","Method","mortality","epicenters","study","focus","Implication","Calibration","Findings","months","numbers"],"language":"en"},

Although bovine nebovirus (BNeV), one of the enteric caliciviruses, is an important causative agent of acute gastroenteritis in cattle, its attachment factors and possibly other cellular receptors remain unknown. Using a comprehensive series of protein-ligand biochemical assays, we sought to determine whether BNeV recognizes cell surface HBGAs and/or SAs as attachment factors. It was found that BNeV virus-like particles (VLPs) bound to A type/H type 2/Le(y) HBGAs expressed in the bovine digestive tract and are related to HBGAs expressed in humans and other host species, suggesting a wide spectrum of HBGA recognition by BNeV. BNeV VLPs also bound to a large variety of different bovine and human saliva samples of all ABH and Lewis types, supporting previously obtained results and suggesting a zoonotic potential of BNeV transmission. Removal of \u03B11,2-linked fucose and \u03B11,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of target HBGAs by confirmation-specific enzymes reduced the binding of BNeV VLPs to synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva, cultured cell lines, and bovine small intestine mucosa, further supporting a wide HBGA binding spectrum of BNeV through recognition of \u03B11,2-linked fucose and \u03B11,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of targeted HBGAs. However, removal of terminal \u03B12,3- and \u03B12,6-linked SAs by their specific enzyme had no inhibitory effects on binding of BNeV VLPs, indicating that BNeV does not use terminal SAs as attachment factors. Further details of the binding specificity of BNeV remain to be explored. IMPORTANCE Enteric caliciviruses such as noroviruses, sapoviruses, and recoviruses are the most important etiological agents of severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and many other mammalian host species. They initiate infection by attachment to cell surface carbohydrate moieties, HBGAs, and/or terminal SAs. However, the attachment factor(s) for BNeV, a recently classified enteric calicivirus genus/type species, remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that BNeV VLPs have a wide spectrum of binding to synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva samples, and bovine duodenal sections. We further discovered that \u03B11,2-linked fucose and \u03B11,3/4-linked fucose epitopes are essential for binding of BNeV VLPs. However, BNeV VLPs do not bind to terminal SAs on cell carbohydrates. Continued investigation regarding the proteinaceous receptor(s) will be necessary for better understanding of the tropism, pathogenesis, and host range of this important viral genus.","publish_time":"2018-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Eun-Hyo; Soliman, Mahmoud; Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Kim, Ji-Yun; Seo, Ja-Young; Park, Jun-Gyu; Kim, Deok-Song; Baek, Yeong-Bin; Kang, Mun-Il; Park, Sang-Ik; Le Pendu, Jacques; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d140ef602b48eb4187ce679fc47ec4a2d8ca248d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5899197.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899197/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["HBGA","ABH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of BNeV VLPs","BNeV virus","binding specificity of BNeV","linked SAs","wide HBGA binding spectrum of BNeV","cell surface HBGAs","synthetic HBGAs","terminal SAs","linked fucose epitopes of target HBGAs","linked fucose epitopes of targeted HBGAs","attachment factors","zoonotic potential of BNeV transmission","wide spectrum of binding","bovine nebovirus","recognition of \u03B11","Removal of \u03B11","cell surface carbohydrate moieties","bovine duodenal sections","cell carbohydrates","bovine digestive tract","type species","removal of terminal \u03B12","human saliva samples","bovine small intestine mucosa","large variety of different bovine","wide spectrum of HBGA recognition","cultured cell lines","mammalian host species","terminal sialic acids","host range","humans","important viral genus","enteric calicivirus genus","IMPORTANCE Enteric caliciviruses","H type","important causative agent of acute gastroenteritis","important etiological agents of severe acute gastroenteritis","confirmation-specific enzymes","histo-blood group antigens","replication cycle","tropism","cattle","inhibitory effects","Lewis types","obtained results","pathogenesis","recoviruses","noroviruses","ABH","comprehensive series of protein","ligand biochemical assays","better understanding","proteinaceous receptor","Caliciviridae family","sapoviruses","cellular receptors","infection","Continued investigation","details","particles"],"language":"en"},

Interferons (IFNs) are critical mediators of the innate defense to infection, and in this study we evaluated the contribution of a specific gene coding for IFIT2 induced by type I IFNs in a murine model of disseminated Candida albicans. Invasive candidiasis is a frequent challenge during immunosuppression or surgical medical interventions, and C. albicans is a common culprit that leads to high rates of mortality. When IFIT2 knockout mice were infected systemically with C. albicans, they were found to have improved survival and reduced fungal burden compared to wild-type mice. One of the mechanisms by which IFIT2 increases the pathological effects of invasive C. albicans appears to be suppression of NADPH oxidase activation. Loss of IFIT2 increases production of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes, and we demonstrate that IFIT2 is a binding partner of a critical regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase, p67(phox). Since the administration of IFN has been used therapeutically to combat viral infections, cancer, and multiple sclerosis, we evaluated administration of IFN-\u03B2 to mice prior to C. albicans infection. IFN-\u03B2 treatment promoted pathology and death from C. albicans infection. We provide evidence that IFIT2 increases the pathological effects of invasive C. albicans and that administration of IFN-\u03B2 has deleterious effects during infection.","publish_time":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stawowczyk, Marcin; Naseem, Shamoon; Montoya, Valeria; Baker, Darren P.; Konopka, James; Reich, Nancy C.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c343dec852bdfd28c3b8d0f06482408ac5ce52bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5904408.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5904408/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NADPH","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["albicans infection","Loss of IFIT2","administration of IFN","IFIT2 knockout mice","pathological effects of invasive","IFN-\u03B2 treatment","murine model of disseminated Candida albicans","pathology","deleterious effects","Invasive candidiasis","IFNs","wild-type mice","critical regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase","critical mediators","suppression of NADPH oxidase activation","innate defense","hyperactive host defense","frequent challenge","immunosuppression","surgical medical interventions","fungal burden","production of reactive oxygen species","p67","leukocytes","multiple sclerosis","binding partner","death","contribution","cancer","balanced immune response","specific gene coding","common culprit","viral infections","high rates of mortality","improved survival","tissue damage","phox","Interferons","evidence","study","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Although complex between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 has been structurally resolved, the molecular details of the SARS-CoV-2 and TMPRSS2 complex are still elusive. TMPRSS2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites, Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816. The present study aims to investigate the conformational details of complex between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike and to point candidate drug targets. Briefly, full length structural model of TMPRSS2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites. The docking simulations showed that TMPRSS2 interacts with the two different loops of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, each containing different cleavage sites. Key functional residues of TMPRSS2 (His296, Ser441 and Ser460) were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared to the N-terminal cleavage site (Arg685/Ser686), TMPRSS2 region that interact with C-terminal cleavage site (Arg815/Ser816) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable. In summary, the present study provide structural characteristics of molecular complex between human TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and points to the candidate drug targets that could further be exploited to direct structure base drug designing.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hussain, Mushtaq; Jabeen, Nusrat; Amanullah, Anusha; Baig, Ayesha Ashraf; Aziz, Basma; Shabbir, Sanya; Raza, Fozia","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/730f5f06e5d15a8cc1a81b9e4fafb7892399f052.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.052639","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","viral spike protein","TMPRSS2 complex","human TMPRSS2","Entry of SARS","TMPRSS2 region","priming of viral spike","resolved structure of SARS","different loops of SARS","different cleavage sites","immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of SARS","Key functional residues of TMPRSS2","length structural model of TMPRSS2","C-terminal cleavage site","N-terminal cleavage site","conformational details of complex","molecular details","potential sites","candidate drug targets","structural characteristics of molecular complex","Arg685","Ser686","Arg815","Ser816","finer details","present study","human ACE2 receptor","direct structure base drug designing","His296","points","directional restraints","serine protease","interaction","Ser441","order","etiological agent of COVID","Ser460","summary","host cell","docking simulations"],"language":"en"},

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was \u003C 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p \u003C 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006). Interpretation The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Juanjuan; Yuan, Quan; Wang, Haiyan; Liu, Wei; Liao, Xuejiao; Su, Yingying; Wang, Xin; Yuan, Jing; Li, Tingdong; Li, Jinxiu; Qian, Shen; Hong, Congming; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Yingxia; Wang, Zhaoqin; He, Qing; Li, Zhiyong; He, Bin; Zhang, Tianying; Ge, Shengxiang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ningshao; Zhang, Zheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff067164497bcfbd9145be223dcd2b05f159dd63.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030189","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","IgM","IgG","confirmed SARS-CoV","course of SARS","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","clinical values of antibody testing","total antibodies","antibody response","antibody detections","days of illness","higher titer of Ab","seroconversion rate","dynamics of antibodies","infection","blood samples","presence of antibodies","Findings","onset","vital clinical information","worse clinical classification","positive rate of RNA","serial plasma samples","early stage of illness","management of COVID","early phase","sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis","routine application of serological testing","strong empirical support","Summary Background","progress","infected patient","week","Interpretation","contrast","hospitalization period","severity of disease","median time","Methods","immunoassays","emerging virus"],"language":"en"},

Methods We set up rapid viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from PCR-positive diagnostic samples using nanopore sequencing, enabling sample-to-sequence in less than 24 hours. We established a rapid review and reporting system with integration of genomic and epidemiological data to investigate suspected cases of healthcare-associated COVID-19. Results Between 13 March and 24 April 2020 we collected clinical data and samples from 5191 COVID-19 patients in the East of England. We sequenced 1000 samples, producing 747 complete viral genomes. We conducted combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of 299 patients at our hospital and identified 26 genomic clusters involving 114 patients. 66 cases (57.9%) had a strong epidemiological link and 15 cases (13.2%) had a plausible epidemiological link. These results were fed back clinical, infection control and hospital management teams, resulting in infection control interventions and informing patient safety reporting. Conclusions We established real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK hospital and demonstrated the benefit of combined genomic and epidemiological analysis for the investigation of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections. This approach enabled us to detect cryptic transmission events and identify opportunities to target infection control interventions to reduce further healthcare-associated infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meredith, L.

This initial section is split chronologically into the early neonatal and infantile period and later childhood and adulthood; with the intention of reflecting clinical practice as closely and succinctly as possible. Disorders of the biliary tree, bile formation and secretion, and hepatocyte metabolism are the core of this chapter, a merger of chapters 3 and 4 of the previous edition. Considerations on the pathogenetic and/or clinical overlap between developmental, genetic and metabolic disorders were the rationale behind this change. The complexity of hepatocyte metabolism is reflected into the miriad of related pathological conditions. Recent technological advances, particularly in genomics in the last five years, have resulted in a plethora of new entities and changes in terminology, challenging the authors to balance detail and application to clinical practice. Tables and figures from previous editions have been largely kept due to their quality and contemporary relevance, whilst new ones have been added to accommodate new advances (e.g. classification of mitochondrial disorders), a compromise to bridge between the two editions for the accustomed reader.

Famotidine is commonly used for gastric acid suppression but also has recently gained attention as an antiviral that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Objective: To determine whether famotidine use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 initially hospitalized to a non-intensive care setting. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Inpatients at a single academic medical center. Participants: Consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection from February 25 to April 13, 2020. Measurements: Famotidine use (exposure); intubation or death (primary outcome) Results: 1,620 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were analyzed including 84 (5.1%) who received famotidine within 24 hours of hospital admission. There were no differences between famotidine users and non-users in age, body mass index, or comorbidities including diabetes or hypertension. 340 (21%) patients met the study composite outcome of death or intubation. Use of famotidine was associated with reduced risk for death or intubation (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.81) and also with reduced risk for death alone (aHR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11-0.78). Proton pump inhibitors, which also suppress gastric acid, were not associated with reduced risk for death or intubation. In patients without COVID-19 hospitalized during the same time period, no association was observed between use of famotidine and death or intubation. Limitations: Retrospective analysis; non-randomized exposure. Conclusion: Famotidine use is associated with reduced risk of intubation or death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to determine whether famotidine therapy improves outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freedberg, D.

Methods: A total of 110 cases were examined among eleven clusters and sporadic cases, and investigated who acquired infection from whom. The clusters included four in Tokyo and one each in Aichi, Fukuoka, Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Kanagawa and Wakayama prefectures. The number of secondary cases generated by each primary case was calculated using contact tracing data. Results: Of the 110 cases examined, 27 (24.6%) were primary cases who generated secondary cases. The odds that a primary case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9). Conclusions: It is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events.

Methods: From December 26, 2019 to March 15, 2020, 1514 severe and 249 critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients were collected from two medical centers in Wuhan, China. We performed multivariable Cox models, Cox model with time-varying exposure and propensity score analysis (both inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting (IPTW) and propensity score matching (PSM)) to estimate the association of corticosteroid use with the risk of in-hospital mortality among severe and critical cases. Results: Corticosteroids were administered in 531 (35.1%) severe and 159 (63.9%) critical patients. Compared to no corticosteroid use group, systemic corticosteroid use showed no benefit in reducing in-hospital mortality in both severe cases (HR=1.77, 95% CI: 1.08-2.89, p=0.023), and critical cases (HR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.08-3.98, p=0.028). In the time-varying Cox analysis that with time varying exposure, systemic corticosteroid use still showed no benefit in either population (for severe patients, HR=2.83, 95% CI: 1.72-4.64, p\u003C 0.001; for critical patients, HR=3.02, 95% CI: 1.59-5.73, p=0.001). Baseline characteristics were matched after IPTW and PSM analysis. For severe COVID-19 patients at admission, corticosteroid use was not associated with improved outcome in either the IPTW analysis. For critical COVID-19 patients at admission, results were consistent with former analysis that corticosteroid use did not reduce in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Corticosteroid use showed no benefit in reducing in-hospital mortality for severe or critical cases. The routine use of systemic corticosteroids among severe and critical COVID-19 patients was not recommended.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, J.; Huang, J.; Zhu, G.; Liu, Y.; Xiao, H.; Zhou, Q.; Si, X.; Yi, H.; Wang, C.; Yang, D.; Chen, S.; Liu, X.; Liu, Z.; Wang, Q.; Lv, Q.; Huang, Y.; Yu, Y.; Guan, X.; Li, Y.; Nirantharakumar, K.; Cheng, K.; Peng, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b33f2c1101ee38e656cd832ef6f6be31d61f4e0d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20097709v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPTW","PSM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe patients","critical patients","severe COVID","critical COVID","systemic corticosteroid use","severe cases","critical cases","corticosteroid use group","association of corticosteroid use","critical hospitalized COVID","routine use of systemic corticosteroids","IPTW analysis","hospital mortality","HR","time-varying Cox analysis","PSM analysis","propensity score analysis","benefit","time-varying exposure","time varying exposure","admission","Results","multivariable Cox models","propensity score matching","treatment-weighting","treatment guidelines","inverse-probability","risk","improved outcome","medical centers","population","Wuhan","China","Conclusions","evidence","Baseline characteristics","Background","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Immunology research in non-traditional model organisms can be advantageous or even necessary (e.g. for host-pathogen interaction studies), but presents multiple challenges, many stemming from an incomplete understanding of potentially species-specific immune cell types, frequencies and phenotypes. Identifying and characterizing immune cells in such organisms is frequently limited by the availability of species-reactive immunophenotyping reagents for flow cytometry, and insufficient prior knowledge of cell type-defining markers. Here, we demonstrate the utility of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to characterize immune cells for which traditional experimental tools are limited. Specifically, we used scRNA-Seq to comprehensively define the cellular diversity of equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy horses across different breeds, ages, and sexes. We identified 30 cell type clusters partitioned into five major populations: Monocytes/Dendritic Cells, B cells, CD3\u002BPRF1\u002B lymphocytes, CD3\u002BPRF1- lymphocytes, and Basophils. Comparative analyses revealed many cell populations analogous to human PBMC, including transcriptionally heterogeneous monocytes and distinct dendritic cell subsets (cDC1, cDC2, plasmacytoid DC). Unexpectedly, we found that a majority of the equine peripheral B cell compartment is comprised of T-bet\u002B B cells; an immune cell subpopulation typically associated with chronic infection and inflammation in human and mouse. Taken together, our results demonstrate the potential of scRNA-Seq for cellular analyses in non-traditional model organisms, and form the basis for an immune cell atlas of horse peripheral blood.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Roosheel S.; Tomlinson, Joy E.; Divers, Thomas J.; Van de Walle, Gerlinde R.; Rosenberg, Brad R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8aff359d1cceb9bdd1a2e2a2a76541d282b5238a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.077362","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune cells","immune cell subpopulation","B cells","Dendritic Cells","cell populations analogous","species-specific immune cell types","cell type clusters","equine peripheral B cell compartment","immune cell atlas of horse peripheral blood","non-traditional model organisms","distinct dendritic cell subsets","scRNA-Seq","insufficient prior knowledge of cell type","Traditional laboratory model organisms","utility of single cell RNA sequencing","cellular diversity of equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells","given experimental model","CD3","cellular analyses","PRF1- lymphocytes","potential of scRNA","traditional experimental tools","heterogeneous monocytes","major populations","human PBMC","Comparative analyses","availability of species","diversity of multicellular life","PBMCs","flow cytometry","cDC1","small fraction","healthy horses","reactive immunophenotyping reagents","cDC2","findings","chronic infection","incomplete understanding","different breeds","T-bet","ages","frequencies","basis","host-pathogen interaction studies","multiple challenges","stemming","inflammation","Immunology research","phenotypes","majority","plasmacytoid DC","sexes","mouse","markers","results","Basophils"],"language":"en"},

While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman\u0027s correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p\u003C0.001; City r=0.6311, p\u003C0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p\u003C0.001; City r=0.6358, p\u003C0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p\u003C0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p\u003C0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p\u003C0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p\u003C0.01) among the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ying, Songmin; Li, Fei; Geng, Xinwei; Li, Zhouyang; Du, Xufei; Chen, Haixia; Chen, Sisi; Zhang, Min; Shao, Zhehua; Wu, Yinfang; Syeda, Madiha Zahra; Yan, Fugui; Che, Luanqing; Zhang, Bin; Lou, Jian; Wang, Shaobin; Chen, Zhengming; Li, Wen; Shen, Ye; Chen, Zhihua; Shen, Huahao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b5be48b7769ccad2f44a8c54efcea5281a6c633.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027623","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["City r","Provincial r","confirmed cases","health resources data","total cases","control of population movement","Hubei","China","primary cases","local health emergency measures","official data of confirmed COVID","adequate medical resources","mass population movement","subsequent control of epidemic","effective governmental health emergency measures","local emergency response","traffic control","index of population inflow","city lockdown","higher fatality","Wuhan","spread","number of public health employees","real-time travel data","infection rates","lower cure rates","overall fatality rate","important roles","Chinese New Year","improved prognosis of affected individuals","relevance","little direct evidence","METHODS Spearman\u0027s correlation analysis","disease","early phase","regions","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND","cities","reduced infections","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","vs"],"language":"en"},

While moderate levels of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA were detected in healthy individuals, we identified serological signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific Fc{gamma} receptor binding, which accurately distinguished COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 induces qualitative changes to antibody Fc upon infection, enhancing Fc{gamma} receptor engagement. Vastly different serological signatures were observed between healthy children and elderly, with markedly higher cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG observed in elderly, whereas children displayed elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM, including receptor binding domain-specific IgM with higher avidity. These results suggest that less-experienced humoral immunity associated with higher IgM, as observed in children, may have the potential to induce more potent antibodies upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. These key insights will inform COVID-19 vaccination strategies, improved serological diagnostics and therapeutics.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Selva, K. J.; van de Sandt, C.

We develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of COVID-19 to link quantitative features of viral shedding, human exposure and transmission in nine countries impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The model was then used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions against virus transmission.

Given incomplete reporting of contextual disaggregation in cumulative case data reported by health departments in the U.S., this research links county- and state-level characteristics to the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A statistical exponential growth model is estimated to describe the outbreak rate using publicly available county-level outbreak data. County- and state-level effects are simultaneously tested with a multilevel linear model using full maximum likelihood. Results: Mirroring findings from international cultural research, collectivism as a value is positively associated with the outbreak rate. The racial and ethnic composition of counties contributes to differences in the outbreak, with Black/African and Asian Americans being more affected. As expected, counties with a higher median age have a stronger outbreak, and so do counties with more people below the age of 18. Higher income, education, and personal health are generally associated with a lower outbreak. Contrariwise, obesity is negatively and significantly related to the outbreak, in agreement with the value expectancy concepts of the health belief model. Smoking is negatively related, but only directionally informative. Air pollution is another significant contributor to the outbreak, but population density does not give statistical significance. Conclusions: The results show that contextual factors influence the initial outbreak of COVID-19. Because of a high intrastate and intercounty variation in these factors, policy makers need to look at pandemics from the smallest subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented effectively.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Messner, W.; Payson, S.

Here, we develop a cell type-specific delivery system, based on vesicular stomatitis virus lacking the viral fusion protein (fusogen) and pseudotyped with AFF-1, a C. elegans cell-to-cell bilateral fusogen from the fusexin family. Following injection of AFF-1-coated virus into the C. elegans pseudocoelom that functions as a circulatory system, we observe specific infection of different cells that express EFF-1 or AFF-1 fusogens. EFF-1-expressing epidermal cells are preferentially infected, whereas mononucleated body wall muscles (BWMs) that do not express any fusogen are rarely infected. The epidermal cells infection is abolished when the host cells do not express EFF-1, while ectopic expression of EFF-1 on BWMs induces their abnormal cell-cell fusion, produces paralyzed-dumpy animals and enhances muscle infection by AFF-1-coated viruses. Thus, our data uncover that AFF-1-coated pseudotyped viruses can be retargeted to desired cells in a controlled manner and serve as a cell-specific delivery system in nematodes with potential applications in regenerative processes, therapies such as dendritic reconnection following injuries, and studies of diverse cellular and viral fusogens.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional well-being. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on mental wellbeing and mood and feelings questionnaires. Methods: The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the multi-languages survey through their networks to general society. Of the 64 questions, 7 were from the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS), and 13 were from the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), which are both validated instruments. Results: Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease (p\u003C0.001 and {Delta}%= 9.4 %) in the total score of mental wellbeing was noted. More individuals (\u002B12.89%) reported a low mental wellbeing during compared to before home confinement. Furthermore, results from the mood and feelings questionnaire (i.e., depressive symptoms) showed a significant increase by 44.9% (p\u003C0.001) in total score with more people (\u002B10%) developing depressive symptoms during compared to before home confinement. Conclusion: The ECLB-COVID19 survey revealed an increased psychosocial strain triggered by the enforced home confinement. To mitigate this high risk of mental disorders and to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL), a crisis-oriented interdisciplinary intervention is urgently needed.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"AMMAR, A.; Mueller, P.; Trabelsi, K.; Chtourou, H.; Boukhris, O.; Masmoudi, L.; Bouaziz, B.; Brach, M.; Schmicker, M.; Bentlage, E.; How, D.; Ahmed, M.; Aloui, A.; Hammouda, O.; Paineiras-Domingos, L.

Knowledge of the incubation period distribution can be used directly to inform decision-making or as inputs into mathematical models. Objectives: The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation periods of COVID-19. Design: Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research Data sources: Publications on the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched. The search was not limited to peer-reviewed published data, but also included pre-print articles. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and confidence intervals of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. The majority of studies suitable for inclusion in the final analysis modelled incubation period as a lognormal distribution. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of the parameters of this distribution. Results: The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters of 1.63 (1.51, 1.75) and 0.50 (0.45, 0.55) respectively. The corresponding mean was 5.8 (5.01, 6.69 days). It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (4.5, 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.6 (9.5, 14.2) days. Conclusions and implications: The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken.

Abstract Fundamentals Many asthma exacerbations are caused by respiratory viral infections that induce the interplay between Th1 and Th2 immune responses. However, the time trends for Th1 and Th2 immune responses during these phenomena have not been well studied. Objective To identify possible mechanisms underlying the link between respiratory viral infections and asthma exacerbations. Patients and methods We recruited 40 adults aged 21\u201358 years for 4 groups. A. Healthy, B. Healthy with viral infection, C. Mild to moderate asthma and D. Same as C, but with viral infection. Th1 and Th2 cytokines in induced sputum samples during the course of acute upper respiratory viral infections in otherwise healthy and asthmatic subjects were monitored. IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-\u03B3 were assayed by ELISA. Viral infection symptoms and asthma severity scores were monitored. Time trends were analyzed using linear mixed models. Results IL-4 and IL-5 levels in groups C and D were higher than in groups A and B. IFN-\u03B3 levels and viral infection symptoms scores in group B spiked by day 2 and rapidly declined by day 7, while in group D, IFN-\u03B3 and symptoms scores for viral infection and asthma peaked much later (days 3\u20135) and slowly declined. The ratios of IL-4 and IL-5 to IFN-\u03B3 in group D were significantly higher than in group C. Conclusions Infection-induced asthma exacerbations may be due to impaired anti-viral Th1-immune responses. There appears to be a critical window of 3\u20135 days for therapeutic intervention.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ding; Xia, Jingwen; Chen, Xiaodong","journal":"Archivos de Bronconeumolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb2d7f1d4cd06c3e1d251509d35b7471621a527e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289610001365; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289610001365","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["and IL","and IFN","asthma and","and D were higher than in groups A and","viral Th1","valores de IL","and slowly declined","\u03B3 levels and viral infection symptoms scores in group","\u03B3 and symptoms scores for viral infection and asthma peaked much later","trends for Th1 and Th2 immune","cocientes IL","Results IL","Viral infection symptoms and asthma severity scores were monitored","the interplay between Th1 and Th2 immune","valores de IFN","grupo D","and rapidly declined by day","The ratios of IL","\u03B3 in group D were significantly higher than in group","while in group D","Healthy with viral infection","s\u00EDntomas de infecci\u00F3n v\u00EDrica","but with viral infection","Patients and methods We recruited","levels in groups","infecci\u00F3n v\u00EDrica aguda","\u03B3 were assayed by ELISA","identify possible mechanisms underlying the link between respiratory viral infections and asthma exacerbations","during the course of acute upper respiratory viral infections in otherwise healthy and asthmatic subjects were monitored","citocinas Th1","in induced sputum","caused by respiratory viral infections that","Conclusions Infection","asma inducidas","asma leve","respuestas inmunitarias antiv\u00EDricas Th1","exacerbaciones","puntuaciones de s\u00EDntomas","grupos","infecciones v\u00EDricas respiratorias","induced asthma exacerbations may be due","years for","Abstract Fundamentals Many asthma exacerbations","spiked by day","days for therapeutic intervention","v\u00EDas respiratorias superiores","interacci\u00F3n de respuestas inmunitarias","tendencias temporales","d\u00EDas","Time trends were analyzed using linear mixed models","critical window of","m\u00E9todo ELISA","pacientes asm\u00E1ticos","during these phenomena have not been well studied","impaired anti","adults aged","Same as","Mild","relaci\u00F3n","muestras de esputo inducido","Objective","Conclusiones","deterioro","There appears","posibles mecanismos subyacentes","individuos","m\u00E1ximos","However","interfer\u00F3n gamma","gravedad","utilizaci\u00F3n de modelos mixtos lineales","Objetivo","fen\u00F3menos","curso","Resumen Fundamento","m\u00E9todos","adultos","intervalo decisivo","intervenci\u00F3n terap\u00E9utica","embargo","Resultados","detalle","interleucina"],"language":"es"},

While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources.

This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model. Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: \u003C= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: \u003E= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: \u003C= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: \u003E= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (\u03C72 = 4.99 \u00D7 10-6, P \u003E 0.999), and five age groups (\u03C72 = 4.85 \u00D7 10-6, P \u003E 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons).

Currently, the most sensitive and commercially validated method for COVID-19 testing is RT-qPCR, designed to detect amplified virus-specific RNA. Reliable testing has proven to be a bottleneck in early diagnosis of virus infection in all countries dealing with the pandemic. Significant performance and quality issues with available testing kits have caused confusion and serious health risks. In order to provide better understanding of the Quality and performance of COVID-19 RNA detection kits on the market, we designed a system to evaluate the specificity (quantitation), sensitivity (LOD) and robustness of the kits using positive RNA and pseudovirus controls based on COVID-19 genomic sequence. We evaluated 8 Nucleic Acid qPCR Kits approved in China, some of which are also approved in the US and EU. Our study showed that half of these 8 kits lack 1:1 linear relationship for virus RNA copy: qPCR signal. Of the 4 with linear response, 2 demonstrated sensitivity at 1 Copy viral RNA/Reaction, suitable for early detection of virus infection. Furthermore, we established the best RNA extraction, handling and qPCR procedures allowing highly sensitive and consistent performance using BGI qPCR kits.

This challenge led to the concept of splitting ventilator between several patients, which aroused interest as well as a strong opposition from multiple professional societies (The joint statement)1.Establishment of a safe ventilator splitting setup which enables monitoring and control of each ventilated patient would be a desirable ability. Achieving independency between the Co-vent patients would enable effective coping with different individual clinical scenarios and broaden the pairing possibilities of patients connected to a single ventilator. We conducted an experiment to determine if our designed setup achieves these goals. Methods: We utilized a double two limbed modified ventilator circuits which were connected to dual lung simulators. Adding readily available pressure sensors (transducers), PEEP valves, flow control valves, one-way (check) valves and HME filters made the circuit safe enough and suitable for our goals. We first examined a single lung simulator establishing the baseline set parameters, while monitoring ventilator measures as Tidal Volume. The initial ventilator setting we chose was a controlled mandatory ventilation mode with a PIP (peak inspiratory pressure) of 25cmH2O, PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) of 5 cmH2O. In pressure control set at 20 cmH2O, the recorded mean TV( tidal volume) was 1000 mL (approximately 500 mL/lung simulator) with an average MV(minute ventilation) of 13 L/min (or 6.5 L/min/lung simulator). After examining the system with the dual modified circuits attached, and obtaining all the ventilation parameters, we simulated several clinical scenarios. We simulated clinical events such as: partial or full obstruction, disconnection, air leak and compliance differentials, which occur frequently on a ventilation course. Thus, it is a paramount system demand to keep undisturbed ventilation to the Co-vent patient A, while being challenged by patient B. Results: The adaptive split ventilator setup yields increased safety, monitoring, and controls ventilation parameters successfully for each connected simulated patient (using lung simulators).It also enables coping with several common clinical scenarios on a ventilation course, by allowing the care provider to control PIP and PEEP of each Co-Vent patient. Conclusion: In a mass crisis setting, when there is a shortage of ventilators supply, and as a last resort, this setup can be a viable option to act upon. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the split ventilator to ventilate dual lung simulators with increased safety, monitoring and ventilation pressures control of each simulated patient. This split ventilator kept supporting a simulated patient with undisturbed parameters while the CO-vent patient was simulated to be disconnected, having an air leak, or exhibiting lung compliance deterioration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a split ventilator setup demonstrates these capabilities. Our pilot experiment suggests a significant potential of expanding the ventilator support resources, and is especially relevant during COVID-19 outbreak. Since this setup has not been used in a clinical setting yet, further research should be conducted to explore the safety limits and the capabilities of this model.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shahroor, S.

The particle electric charge distribution (also measured in the test chamber with the ELPI) was rapidly affected by the ion emission. It was concluded that the corona discharge ion emitters (either positive or negative), which are capable of creating an ion density of 105\u2013106 e\u00B1 cm\u22123, can be efficient in controlling fine and ultrafine aerosol pollutants in indoor air environments, such as a typical office or residential room. At a high ion emission rate, the particle mobility becomes sufficient so that the particle migration results in their deposition on the walls and other indoor surfaces. Within the tested ranges of the particle size and ion density, the particles were charged primarily due to the diffusion charging mechanism. The particle removal efficiency was not significantly affected by the particle size, while it increased with increasing ion emission rate and the time of emission. The performance characteristics of three commercially available ionic air purifiers, which produce unipolar ions by corona discharge at relatively high emission rates, were evaluated. A 30-minute operation of the most powerful device among those tested resulted in the removal of about 97% of 0.1\u03BCm particles and about 95% of 1\u03BCm particles from the air in addition to the natural decay effect.","publish_time":"2004-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uk Lee, Byung; Yermakov, Mikhail; Grinshpun, Sergey A.","journal":"Atmospheric Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45fbd8208495f2995624a522695571c9c5a36559.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231004005953; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231004005953","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ELPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["particle size distribution","particle mobility","ion density","high ion emission rate","increasing ion emission rate","time of emission","particle aerodynamic size range","indoor air environments","particle migration results","particle removal efficiency","room-size","\u03BCm particles","corona discharge ion emitters","ultrafine particles","particle electric charge distribution","high emission rates","continuous emission of unipolar ions","indoor surfaces","indoor aerosol concentration","air cleaning factor","available ionic air purifiers","test chamber","ELPI","ultrafine aerosol pollutants","natural decay effect","real time","residential room","tested ranges","addition","deposition","3m3","typical office","walls","ability","performance characteristics","bioaerosol agents","emerging diseases","minute operation","powerful device","order","evolution","biological warfare","event of bioterrorism","diffusion","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4. The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals. However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19 transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease. All in all, the take-home message is that everyone in the community, whether a frontliner or not, should be protected or should implement preventive measures to avoid being infected.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buhat, Christian Alvin H; Torres, Monica C; Olave, Yancee H; Gavina, Maica Krizna A; Felix, Edd Francis O; Gamilla, Gimelle B; Verano, Kyrell Vann B; Babierra, Ariel L; Rabajante, Jomar Fajardo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045195","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frontliners","basic reproductive number of COVID","general public","average number of persons","higher reproduction number","transmission dynamics of COVID","model results","simple model","epidemic curve","disease","conceptual mathematical model","importance of community effort","customer service","delivery workers","healthcare workers","food service crews","retail personnel","transport","primary case","infection risk","cases","factors","population","insights","preventive measures","susceptible individuals","different countries","study","take-home message","simulations","Philippines","superspreaders"],"language":"en"},

Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of these children was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5 Celsius). All children showed increased lymphocytes (\u003E4.4*109/L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. One child had elevated serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reaction protein. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas persistent presence of viral RNA was found in stools of all children. One case had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 8 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 20 days. At the time of writing, one child still had positive results for RT-PCR analysis in stools after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory samples (over 19 days behind). Conclusions: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are very different from adult patients in regards to epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xing, Yuhan; Ni, Wei; Wu, Qin; Li, Wenjie; Li, Guoju; Tong, Jianning; Song, Xiufeng; Xing, Quansheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f332a4421ce9d32958a22c95fd90b325dbc96ee4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033159","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["fecal SARS-CoV","pediatric patients","stools of infected children","Fecal shedding of SARS","pediatric cases of COVID","Clearance of SARS","adult patients","Prolonged shedding of SARS","days","radiological characteristics","fecal specimens","fecal excretion","negative conversion of viral RNA","respiratory samples","respiratory tract","laboratory","treatment data","throat swabs","coronavirus disease","Radiological changes","identified virus","person","persistent presence of viral RNA","Severe acute respiratory coronavirus","RT-PCR analysis","abatement of fever","adult populations","positive results","supportive treatment","Severity of disease","polymerase-chain reaction","C-reaction protein","elevated serum levels of procalcitonin","regards","onset of illness","household contacts of adults","Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase","body temperature higher","predominant symptom","normal white blood cell","admission","Qingdao","weeks","Background","good response","potential","Shandong Province","China","symptoms","published studies","kindergartens","infection","Conclusions","time of writing","increased lymphocytes","schools","Massive efforts","evidence","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Objectives To assess HBoV prevalence and associated disease in a cohort of respiratory patients in the East Midlands, UK between 2015 and 2019. Study design We initially investigated the undiagnosed burden of HBoV in a retrospective paediatric cohort sampled between 2015 and 2017 using an in-house PCR assay. HBoV was subsequently incorporated into the standard respiratory diagnostic pathway and we audited a calendar year of HBoV positive results between 2018 and 2019. Results Our retrospective PCR screening of previously routine diagnostic-negative samples from juvenile patients identified a 9% (n = 30) prevalence of HBoV type 1. These apparentHBoV1 mono-infections were frequently associated with respiratory tract symptoms, often severe including ventilation, oxygen and steroid intervention with 31% (n = 9) of individuals requiring intensive care. When HBoV screening was subsequently adopted into the routine respiratory diagnostic pathway, year-round infections were observed in both children and adults peaking in February. 185 of 9098 (2.03%) individuals were found to be HBoV positive with children aged 12-24 months the principally infected group. However, HBoV infection was also observed in patients aged over 60, predominantly as a mono-infection. 23% of the 185 unique patients were HBoV monoinfectedand persistent low-level DNA positivity was observed in 15 individuals up to 6-months after initial presentation. Conclusion HBoV1 is a prevalent respiratory infection in the UK capable of causing serious monoinfections.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bagasi, Arwa A.; Howson-Wells, Hannah C.; Clark, Gemma; Tarr, Alexander W.; Soo, Shiu; Irving, William L.; McClure, C.

Novel methods like pooling of samples are the need of the hour. Method: Extracted RNA samples were randomly placed in pools of 8 on a 96 well plate. Both individual RNA (ID) and pooled RNA RT-qPCR for the screening E gene were done in the same plate and the positivity for the E gene was seen. Results: The present study demonstrated that pool testing with 8 RNA samples can easily detect even up to a single positive sample with Ct value as high as 38. The present study also showed that the results of pool testing is not affected by number of positive samples in a pool. Conclusion: Pooling of 8 RNA samples can reduce the time and expense by one eighth, and can help expand diagnostic capabilities, especially during constrained supply of reagents and PCR kits for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, E.; Padhi, A.; Khodare, A.; Aggarwal, R.; Ramachandran, K.; Mehta, V.; Kilikdar, M.; Dubey, S.; Kumar, G.; Sarin, S.

Here, we establish the recently discovered pharmacologic modulator of ER proteostasis 147 as an effective host-centered antiviral strategy. Compound 147 reduces infection by attenuating viral replication without causing toxicity in host cells. 147 is a preferential activator of the ATF6 pathway of the unfolded protein response, which requires targeting of cysteine residues primarily on protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). We find that the antiviral activity of 147 is independent of ATF6 induction but does require modification of reactive thiols on protein targets. Targeting PDIs using RNAi and other PDI small molecule inhibitors was unable to recapitulate the antiviral effects, suggesting additional identified protein targets of 147 may mediate the activity. Importantly, 147 can impair infection of multiple strains of Dengue and Zika virus, indicating that it is suitable as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almasy, Katherine M.; Davies, Jonathan P.; Lisy, Samantha M.; Tirgar, Reyhaneh; Tran, Sirena C.; Plate, Lars","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f464dca9855a7840bc627f02b59c95b16477bf6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.098624","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity","antiviral effects","antiviral strategy","protein disulfide isomerases","additional identified protein targets","unfolded protein response","broad-spectrum antiviral agent","PDIs","infection of multiple strains of Dengue","ATF6 pathway","Zika virus","effective host","host cells","independent of ATF6 induction","PDI small molecule inhibitors","RNAi","viral replication","modification of reactive thiols","cysteine residues","pharmacologic modulator of ER proteostasis","toxicity","widespread human pathogens","preferential activator","active therapeutics","Compound","Flaviviruses"],"language":"en"},

We compare the dynamics of COVID-19 death rates in countries using anti-malaria drugs as a treatment from the start of the epidemic versus countries that do not, the day of the 3rd death and the following 10 days. We show that the first group have a much slower dynamic in death rates that the second group. This univariate analysis is of course only one additional piece of evidence in the debate regarding the efficiency of anti-malaria drugs, and it is also limited as the two groups certainly have other systemic differences in the way they responded to the pandemic, in the way they report death or in their population that better explain differences in dynamics (systematic differences that may also explain their choice to rely on anti-malaria drugs in the first place). Nevertheless, the difference in dynamics is so striking that we believe that the urgency context commands presenting the univariate analysis before delving into further analysis. In the end, this data might ultimately be either a piece of evidence in favor or anti-malaria drugs or a stepping stone in understanding further what other ecological aspects place a role in the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Izoulet, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6939a1e86ffde0108c224734c16f0018b217aec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20063875v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficiency of anti-malaria drugs","anti-malarial drugs","dynamics of COVID","death rates","systematic differences","univariate analysis","countries","systemic differences","way","place","additional piece of evidence","used treatment","systematic study","debate","high rate of severe clinical cases","international public health problem","favor","stepping stone","good potential candidate","urgency context commands","role","slower dynamic","start","choice","recent survey of physicians","ecological aspects","epidemic","hydroxychloroquine","paper","population","Coronavirus Disease","data","groups","days","pandemic","deaths","end","treatments"],"language":"en"},

Multi-stage probability sampling was used in each city to select 500 households, within which one resident was randomly chosen for testing. The Wondfo lateral flow rapid test for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been validated in four different settings, including our own, with pooled estimates of sensitivity (84.8%, 95% CI 81.4%;87.8%) and specificity (99.0%, 95% CI 97.8%;99.7%), which are within the acceptable range for epidemiological studies.

In the second round (Apr 25-27) there were six positive subjects (0.1333%; 95% CI 0.0489%;0.2900%). We also tested family members of positive index cases, and nine out of 19 had positive results.

The goals of this study were to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant \u201Cepitope hotspot\u201D regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA genotypes of approximately 22 000 individuals to develop a \u201Cdigital twin\u201D type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population, and used the approach to identify an optimal constellation of epitopes hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have managed to profile the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identify a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malone, Brandon; Simovski, Boris; Molin\u00E9, Cl\u00E9ment; Cheng, Jun; Gheorghe, Marius; Fontenelle, Hugues; Vardaxis, Ioannis; Tenn\u00F8e, Simen; Malmberg, Jenny-Ann; Stratford, Richard; Clancy, Trevor","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e83cff607fc35bff49974c0f7283ee1a7e349704.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.052084","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NEC Immune Profiler","HLA"],"locations":["Monte Carlo"],"keyphrases":["global population","subset of epitope hotspots","entire SARS-CoV","human proteome","diverse human population","infected-host cell surface","host-infected cell surface antigen presentation","broad coverage","HLA-B","HLA genotypes","comprehensive epitope maps","host-infected cells","host immune system","broad spectrum of HLA types","viral proteome","Monte Carlo simulation","digital twin simulation","HLA-DR alleles","optimal constellation of epitopes hotspots","effective different combinations of hotspots","cell epitopes capable","maximum coverage","type simulation","NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools","robust Monte Carlo","pandemic of Coronavirus disease","broad repertoire of T","novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","immunogenicity predictors","immunogenicity predictions","significant homology","nonsynonymous mutations","immunogenic landscape","different sequences","conserved regions","present suffering","blueprints","proteins","protection","input","approach","individuals","universal vaccines","sequence conservation analysis","artificial intelligence","study","COVID","reduced potential","vaccine formulation","chance","trend","database","aims","autoimmune responses","goals"],"language":"en"},

Design : Systematic review Data sources:We searched PUMBED. Medline, Embase, MedRxiv and bioRxiv databases upto 31st March 2020 utilizing combinations of word variants for \u0022 coronavirus \u0022 or \u0022 COVID-19 \u0022 or \u0022 severe acute respiratory syndrome \u0022 or \u0022 SARS-COV-2 \u0022 and \u0022 pregnancy \u0022 . We also included data from preprint articles. Study selection : Original case reports and case series on pregnant women with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data extraction : We included 23 studies [China (20), USA (01), Republic of Korea (01) and Honduras, Central America (01) reporting the information on 172 pregnant women and 162 neonates. The primary outcome measures were maternal health characteristics and adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates was extracted. Treatments given to pregnant women with COVID-19 were also recorded. Results: Out of 172 women affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, 160 women had delivered 162 newborns (2 set of twins, 12 ongoing pregnancies). In pregnant women with COVID-19, the most common symptoms were fever (54%), cough (35%), myalgia (17%), dyspnea (12%) and diarrhea (4%). Pneumonia was diagnosed by CT scan imaging in 100 % of COVID-19 pregnant women. Pregnancy complications included delivery by cesarean section (89%), preterm labor (21%), fetal distress (9%) and premature rupture of membranes (8%). The most common co-morbidities associated with pregnant women with COVID-19 were diabetes (11%), hypertensive disorders (9%), placental disorders (5%), co-infections (6%), scarred uterus (5%), hypothyroidism (5%) and anemia (4%). Amongst the neonates of COVID-19 mothers, preterm birth (23%), respiratory distress syndrome (14%), pneumonia (14%) low birth weight (11%), small for gestational age (3%) were reported. There was one still birth and one neonatal death reported. Vertical transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 11%. Conclusion In pregnant women with COVID-19, diabetes and hypertensive disorders are common co-morbidities and there is a risk of preterm delivery. Amongst the neonates born to mothers with COVID-19, respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia are common occurrence. There is an evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in women with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gajbhiye, R.; Modi, D.; Mahale, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.11.20062356v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":["SARS","CT"],"locations":["Republic","Central America"],"keyphrases":["pregnant women","neonates of COVID","SARS-COV","fetal transmission of SARS CO-V","common co-morbidities","fetal outcomes","Vertical transmission rate of SARS","evidence of vertical transmission of SARS","fetal distress","respiratory distress syndrome","Pneumonia","preterm birth","adverse pregnancy outcomes","confirmed diagnosis of SARS","neonatal outcomes","common occurrence","co-infections","Pregnancy complications","common symptoms","hypertensive disorders","incidence of maternal","preprint reports","severe acute respiratory syndrome","diabetes","Systematic review Data sources","mothers","risk of preterm delivery","Data extraction","placental disorders","preterm labor","maternal health characteristics","Original case reports","low birth weight","case series","neonatal death","preprint articles","bioRxiv databases upto","primary outcome measures","Embase","MedRxiv","utilizing combinations of word variants","Study selection","cesarean section","set of twins","aim","coronavirus","Design","CT scan imaging","Honduras","ongoing pregnancies","Medline","studies","fever","PUMBED","newborns","information","Conclusion","Treatments","Central America","Abstract Objective","premature rupture of membranes","hypothyroidism","dyspnea","myalgia","USA","scarred uterus","Republic of Korea","gestational age","China","cough","diarrhea","anemia","Results"],"language":"en"},

Here we tested whether tree shrew, an emerging experimental animal domesticated from wild animal, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No clinical signs were observed in SARS-CoV-2 inoculated tree shrews during this experiment except the increasing body temperature (above 39\u00B0 C) particular in female animals during infection. Low levels of virus shedding and replication in tissues occurred in all three age groups, each of which showed his own characteristics. Histopathological examine revealed that pulmonary abnormalities were mild but the main changes although slight lesions were also observed in other tissues. In summary, tree shrew is not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may not be a suitable animal for COVID-19 related researches.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Yuan; Wang, Junbin; Kuang, Dexuan; Xu, Jingwen; Yang, Mengli; Ma, Chunxia; Zhao, Siwen; Li, Jingmei; Long, Haiting; Ding, Kaiyun; Gao, Jiahong; Liu, Jiansheng; Wang, Haixuan; Li, Haiyan; Yang, Yun; Yu, Wenhai; Yang, Jing; Zheng, Yinqiu; Wu, Daoju; Lu, Shuaiyao; Liu, Hongqi; Peng, Xiaozhong","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ec1201b1993ef8536197cef45c58d6ecfb62074.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.029736","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","infection","wild animal","suitable animal","COVID","tissues","emerging experimental animal","inoculated tree shrews","female animals","susceptibility of animals","serious threat","main changes","pulmonary abnormalities","global public health","increasing body temperature","slight lesions","replication","related researches","Low levels of virus","huge economic losses","pandemic event","summary","scientific questions","clinical signs","world","age groups","characteristics"],"language":"en"},

However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators have also been reported in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that 16% of COVID-19 patients who died developed secondary infection, which might indicate an immune-suppressed state. We explored kinetics of mHLA-DR expression, the most widely used marker of innate immune suppression in critically ill patients, in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Twenty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, of which 75% was male and 79% had comorbidities. All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited large high levels of inflammatory parameters such as CRP and PCT. mHLA-DR expression levels were mostly within the normal range of 15000 - 45000 mAb/cell and showed no change over time. COVID-19 patients displayed notably higher mHLA-DR expression levels compared with bacterial septic shock patients. None of the COVID-19 patients developed a secondary infection. In conclusion, despite a pronounced inflammatory response, mHLA-DR expression kinetics indicate no overt innate immune suppression in COVID-19 patients. These data signify that innate immune suppression as a negative feedback mechanism following PAMP-induced inflammation appears not to be present in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kox, M.; Frenzel, T.; Schouten, J.; van de Veerdonk, F.; Koenen, H.

It is therefore important to characterize the clinical course and outcome of Covid-19 in this vulnerable population and identify therapeutic strategies that are safe. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 54 adult kidney transplant patients diagnosed with Covid-19 and managed in New York State, the epicenter of Covid-19 pandemic. The patients were evaluated by video visits, phone interviews, or in the Emergency Room for respiratory illness symptoms consistent with Covid-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Characteristics of the patients were stratified by hospitalization status and disease severity. Clinical course including alterations in immunosuppressive therapy were retrieved from their electronic medical records. Primary outcomes included recovery from Covid-19 symptoms, acute kidney injury, graft failure, and case fatality rate. Results: Of the 54 SARS-Cov-2 positive kidney transplant recipients, 39 with moderate to severe symptoms were admitted and 15 with mild symptoms were managed at home. Hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients were more likely to be male, of Hispanic ethnicity, and to have cardiovascular disease. At baseline, all but 2 were receiving tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and 32 were on a steroid free immunosuppression regimen. Tacrolimus dosage was reduced in 46% of hospitalized patients and maintained at baseline level in the non-hospitalized cohort. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosage was maintained at the baseline dosage in 11% of hospitalized patients and 64% of non-hospitalized patients, and was stopped in 61% hospitalized patients and 0% in the non-hospitalized cohort. Azithromycin or doxycycline were prescribed at a similar rate among hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients (38% vs. 40%). Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed in 79% of hospitalized patients and only one of 15 non-hospitalized patients. Acute kidney injury occurred in 51% of hospitalized patients. Patients with severe disease were more likely to have elevations in inflammatory biomarkers at presentation. At a median of 21 days follow up, 67% of patients have had their symptoms resolved or improved and 33% have persistent symptoms. Graft failure requiring hemodialysis occurred in 3 of 39 hospitalized patients (8%). Three of 39 (8%) hospitalized patients expired and none of the 15 non-hospitalized patients expired. Conclusions: Clinical presentation of Covid-19 in kidney transplant recipients was similar to what has been described in the general population. The case fatality rate in our entire cohort of 54 kidney transplant recipients was reassuringly low and patients with mild symptomology could be successfully managed at home. Data from the pilot study suggest that a strategy of systematic screening and triage to inpatient or outpatient care, close monitoring, and judicious use of immunosuppressive drugs rather than cessation is beneficial.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lubetzky, M.; Aull, M.; Craig-Shapiro, R.; Lee, J.; Sultan, S.; Marku-Podvorica, J.; Gingras, L.; Kodiyanplakkal, R.

There are two ways to reduce elevated CO2 concentrations ([CO2]high): reducing human emissions or increasing their absorption by oceans and plants. However, in response to [CO2]high, plants diminish gas exchange and CO2 uptake by closing stomata. Surprisingly, we do not know how plants sense CO2 in their environment, and the basic mechanisms of the plant response to [CO2]high are very poorly understood. Here, we show that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are plant CO2 receptors. We demonstrate that MPK4, a prominent MAPK that is known to be involved in the stomatal response to [CO2]high1\u20133, is capable of binding CO2 and is directly activated by a very low increase in [CO2] in vivo and in vitro. Unlike MPK4 activation by infections4, stress and hormones within known MAPK signalling cascades, [CO2]high-induced MPK4 activation is independent of the upstream regulators MKK1 and MKK2. Moreover, once activated, MPK4 is prone to inactivation by bicarbonate. The identification of stress-responsive MPK4 as a CO2 receptor sheds new light on the integration of various environmental signals in guard cells, setting up MPK4 as the main hub regulating CO2 availability for photosynthesis. This result could help to find new ways to increase CO2 uptake by plants.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ga\u0142ga\u0144ska, Hanna; Ga\u0142ga\u0144ski, \u0141ukasz","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e4e56f2153ade83991bac222ea764ce85ef2e4d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.086116","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CO2 uptake","CO2 availability","plants sense CO2","plant CO2 receptors","elevated CO2 concentrations","capable of binding CO2","CO2 receptor sheds new light","responsive MPK4","high-induced MPK4 activation","plant response","new ways","stomatal response","known MAPK signalling cascades","identification of stress","prominent MAPK","mitogen-activated protein kinases","low increase","hormones","MAPKs","integration of various environmental signals","gas exchange","guard cells","threat","upstream regulators MKK1","main hub","infections4","absorption","basic mechanisms","photosynthesis","human emissions","high1","ecological balance","Earth","MKK2","oceans","inactivation","bicarbonate","industrial era","result","atmosphere"],"language":"en"},

The model also showed how small changes in variables can make large differences in outcomes and highlights the importance of healthcare preparedness during pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yeo, Yao Yu; Yeo, Yao-Rui; Yeo, Wan-Jin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf779757265b3301e6e0672c5212b3dd55fe8a12.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["East Coasts"],"keyphrases":["COVID","SEIR model","number of cases","number of new cases","US West","greater numbers of functional testing kits available","quasi-worst-case scenario prediction","outcomes","variables","large differences","outbreak","small changes","importance of healthcare preparedness","screening","stochastic variant","East Coasts","current data","Runge-Kutta methods","pandemics","ongoing coronavirus disease","computation results","global concern","paper"],"language":"en"},

It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective. We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country\u0027s medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country\u0027s vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19. Countries\u0027 vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country\u0027s vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries\u0027 management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic. * Note: This study was completed on February 15, 2020.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yuan-Chien; Chi, Wan-Ju; Lin, Yu-Ting; Lai, Chun-Yeh","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f87eec8279bc79900914c5689bb42f49f41aace5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029413","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Taiwan","South Korea","Hong Kong","Japan"],"keyphrases":["China","spatiotemporal risk assessment","dynamic risk of COVID","country\u0027s vulnerability","number of COVID","spatiotemporal spread","future worldwide risk","Countries\u0027 vulnerability","spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns","simulation results of future cases","possible risk analysis","new global epidemic","preliminary risk assessment","spatiotemporal changes","initial epidemic prevention capabilities","country\u0027s medical","possible transmission","cumulative number of cases","global perspective","global pandemic","study","stage simulation model","linear relationship","relevant information","connectivity of countries","pneumonia infection outbreak","various countries\u0027 management strategies","ongoing novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","prediction models","Japan","Hong Kong","days","different scenarios","South Korea","Taiwan","imported case","Wuhan","high exponential decrease","international human movement","Hubei Province","total","vulnerable areas","specific medicine","method","Note","provinces"],"language":"en"},

One major hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the inefficiency and shortage of medical tests. There have been increasing efforts on developing deep learning methods to diagnose COVID-19 based on CT scans. However, these works are difficult to reproduce and adopt since the CT data used in their studies are not publicly available. Besides, these works require a large number of CTs to train accurate diagnosis models, which are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we aim to address these two problems. We build a publicly-available dataset containing hundreds of CT scans positive for COVID-19 and develop sample-efficient deep learning methods that can achieve high diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19 from CT scans even when the number of training CT images are limited. Specifically, we propose an Self-Trans approach, which synergistically integrates contrastive self-supervised learning with transfer learning to learn powerful and unbiased feature representations for reducing the risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Self-Trans approach compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach achieves an F1 of 0.85 and an AUC of 0.94 in diagnosing COVID-19 from CT scans, even though the number of training CTs is just a few hundred.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, X.; Yang, X.; Zhang, S.; Zhao, J.; Zhang, Y.; Xing, E.; Xie, P.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc1edd72df527404508d48292ecfa6e0137ae333.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.13.20063941v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CT data","diagnosing COVID","hundreds of CT scans positive","number of training CT images","transfer learning","number of training CTs","contrastive self-supervised learning","high diagnosis accuracy of COVID","proposed Self-Trans approach","sample-efficient deep learning methods","large number of CTs","works","available dataset","Coronavirus disease","accurate diagnosis models","superior performance","unbiased feature representations","inefficiency","spreading","state-of-the-art baselines","shortage of medical tests","risk of overfitting","Extensive experiments","AUC","studies","efforts","world","major hurdle","F1","individuals","deaths","paper","problems"],"language":"en"},

However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these n nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until 1-p fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold pc and the size of the giant component P\u221E for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P(k). In the limit of n\u2192\u221E we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for n=1 we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, pc increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between |pc(\u221E) -pc (n)| and n as |pc(\u221E) -pc (n)|~n-1exp(-\u03B1 n). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P(k)~k-\u03B3,2\u003C\u03B3\u003C3), we find that pc has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n=1 to order of logN (N is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, knowledge of order of logN nodes and immunizing them can reduce dramatically an epidemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yangyang; Sanhedrai, Hillel; Dong, Gaogao; Shekhtman, Louis M.; Wang, Fan; Buldyrev, Sergey V.; Havlin, Shlomo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/889d251eea718bcc988a082ac52af52b53ccdb01.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056606","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["n increases","\u03B1 n","limit of n","optimal nodes","logN nodes","p fraction of nodes","SF networks","Targeted immunization","targeted attack","critical percolation threshold pc","knowledge of order","attacks of large-scale networks","giant component P","size of network","arbitrary degree distributions P","novel immunization strategy","optimal value","significant attention","approach","observations","prior work","new scaling relationship","complete information","known case of random failure","scientific community","real-world scenarios","Scale-free","time","exp","current COVID","analytical framework","transition","assessment","extremes","process","epidemics"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We reviewed the electrophysiology laboratory records in 3 affected cities: Wenzhou in China, Milan in Italy and London, United Kingdom. We interviewed electrophysiologists in each centre to gather information on the impact of the pandemic on working patterns and on the health of staff members. Results: There was a striking decline in interventional electrophysiology activity in each of the centres. The decline occurred within a week of the recognition of widespread community transmission of the virus in each region and shows a striking correlation with the national figures for new diagnoses of COVID-19 in each case. During the period of restriction, work-flow dropped to \u003C5% of normal, consisting of emergency cases only. In 2 of 3 centres, electrophysiologists were redeployed to perform emergency work outside electrophysiology. Among the centres studied, only Wenzhou has seen a recovery from the restrictions in activity.

Stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. On admission, 85.5% COVID-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries. Univariable logistic regression showed that ALT and TBIL, two indexes of hepatic injury, AST, myoglobin and LDH, AST/ALT ratio, several markers of myocardial injury, creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion. Older age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission may be potential prognostic indicators. Early hospitalization is of great significance to prevent multiple organ damage and improve the survival of COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Lin; Fei, Jun; Xiang, Hui-Xian; Xiang, Ying; Tan, Zhu-Xia; Li, Meng-Die; Liu, Fang-Fang; Liu, Hong-Yan; Zheng, Ling; Li, Ying; Zhao, Hui; Xu, De-xiang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035329","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALT","AST/ALT","AST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","admission","comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID","survival of COVID","oxygenation index lower","lower oxygenation index","AST","oxygenation index higher","ALT ratio","influence factors of death risk","urea nitrogen","TBIL","LDH","hepatic disease","indexes of hepatic injury","Coronavirus disease","Biochemical indexes","indexes of renal injury","cardiac disease","Severe cases","clinical characteristics","chronic pulmonary disease","infection","common cases","critical cases","markers of myocardial injury","association of demographic data","Univariable logistic regression","Multivariable logistic regression","confirmed SARS-CoV","older ages","Early hospitalization","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","multiple organ damage","extrapulmonary organ injuries","creatinine","uric acid","great significance","hypertension","myoglobin","diabetes","electronic medical records","potential prognostic indicators","Stratified analysis","study","patient\u0027s prognosis","world","end of follow-up","aim","day","Conclusion","Background","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses. We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients who require hospitalization for COVID-19 and how these compare to the available resources. Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. We deployed this model as an interactive online tool.6 The model is implemented in R 3.5, RStudio, RShiny 1.4.0 and Python 3.7. The parameters used may be modified as data become available, for use at other institutions, and to generate sensitivity analyses. We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the demand generated by COVID-19\u002B arrivals for a hypothetical acute care medical center. The model calculated that the number of patients requiring an IC bed would equal the number of IC beds on Day 23, the number of patients requiring a ventilator would equal the number of ventilators available on Day 27, and the number of patients requiring an AC bed and coverage by the Medicine Service would equal the capacity of the Medicine service on Day 21. In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, hospitals must understand their current and future capacity to care for patients with severe illness. While there is significant uncertainty around the parameters used to develop this model, the analysis is based on transparent logic and starts from observed data to provide a robust basis of projections for hospital managers. The model demonstrates the need and provides an approach to address critical questions about staffing patterns for IC and AC, and equipment capacity such as ventilators.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Teng; McFarlane, Kelly; Vallon, Jacqueline; Yang, Linying; Xie, Jin; Blanchet, Jose; Glynn, Peter; Staudenmayer, Kristan; Schulman, Kevin; Scheinker, David","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8a4cf7fd63f5d001401127f0e49d53817b5e6a1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042762","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Acute Care"],"locations":["United States","China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","number of patients","number of IC beds","number of available beds","number of Intensive Care","number of ventilators available","hospital capacity planning","accessible interactive model","hospital planning","future capacity","equipment capacity","hospital managers","hospital leaders","Day","parameters","AC bed","available resources","estimates","hypothetical acute care medical center","demand","observed data","Medicine Service","ventilators necessary","approach","local data","patient population","use","sensitivity analyses","presence of significant uncertainty","interactive online tool","staffing patterns","address critical questions","robust basis of projections","Italy","arrivals","proportion","coverage","characteristics","parts of China","transparent logic","epidemic","World Health Organization","hospitals","institutions","confirmed cases of coronavirus disease","United States","national state of emergency","RStudio","RShiny","countries","pandemic","analysis","need","compare","hospitalization","severe illness","Python","response","Inputs","rate"],"language":"en"},

In children previous studies have reported colonisation to be a symptomatic event and described a relationship between symptom severity/frequency and colonisation density. The evidence for this in adults is lacking in the literature. This study uses an experimental human pneumococcal challenge model to explore whether pneumococcal colonisation (or co-colonisation with a respiratory virus) is a symptomatic event in healthy adults. Methods Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 were recruited and inoculated intra-nasally with either Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 6B, 23F) or saline as a control. Respiratory viral swabs were obtained prior to inoculation. Nasal and non-nasal symptoms were then assessed using a modified Likert score between 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (cannot function). The rate of symptoms reported between groups was compared and a correlation analysis performed. Results Data from 54 participants were analysed. 46 were inoculated with S. pneumoniae (29 with 6B, 17 with 23F) and 8 received saline. In total, 14 became experimentally colonised (30.4%), all of which were inoculated with 6B serotype. There was no statistically significant difference in nasal (p= 0.45) or non-nasal symptoms (p=0.28) between the pneumococcal inoculation group and the saline group. There was no direct correlation between colonisation density and symptom severity in those who were colonised. In the 22% (12/52) who were co-colonised with pneumococcus and respiratory viruses there was no statistical difference in either nasal or non-nasal symptoms (virus positive p=0.74 and virus negative p=1.0).

One of the observations and a recurring theme is the disproportionate differences in the incidence of infection and the consequent mortality between males and females. We, therefore, analyzed retrospective datasets from the previous epidemics and the ongoing pandemic in order to address these differences in clinical outcomes. The data shows that even though the infection rates are similar, the odds ratio of male mortality remains high, indicating a divergence in the crosstalk between the three pathogenic human Coronavirus (hCoVs)- the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 and immune effectors in the two sexes. One proximate cause is the sex-specific modulation of the X-linked genes that can influence susceptibility to infection.

The tunable parameters of this model bear relevance to monitoring of an epidemic. This model was used to show that some of the commonly seen features of cumulative infections in real data can be explained by piece wise constant changes in interventions and population influx. We also show that the data of cumulative infections from twelve Indian states between mid March and mid April 2020 can be generated from the model by applying interventions according to a set of heuristic rules. Prediction for the next ten days based on this model, reproduced real data very well. In addition, our model also reproduced the time series of recoveries and deaths.

Not only do such molecules often fulfil critical biological functions, but also, they may alter the binding of newly designed drugs. In crystal structures, sites consistently occupied in each unit cell yield electron density clouds that represent water molecule presence. These are recorded in virtually all high-resolution structures obtained through X-ray diffraction. In this work, we utilized the wealth of data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank to train a residual deep learning model named \u2018hotWater\u2019 to identify sites on the surface of proteins that are most likely to bind water, the so-called water hot spots. The model can be used to score existing water molecules from a PDB file to provide their ranking according to the predicted binding strength or to scan the surface of a protein to determine the most likely water hot-spots de novo. This is computationally much more efficient than currently used molecular dynamics simulations. Based on testing the model on three example proteins, which have been resolved using both high-resolution X-ray crystallography (providing accurate positions of trapped waters) as well as low-resolution X-ray diffraction, NMR or CryoEM (where structure refinement does not yield water positions), we were able to show that the hotWater method is able to recover in the \u201Cwater-free\u201D structures many water binding sites known from the high-resolution structures. A blind test on a newly solved protein structure with waters removed from the PDB also showed good prediction of the crystal water positions. This was compared to two known algorithms that use electron density and was shown to have higher recall at resolutions \u003E2.6 \u00C5. We also show that the algorithm can be applied to novel proteins such as the RNA polymerase complex from SARS-CoV-2, which could be of use in drug discovery.

Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keeling, Matt J; Hollingsworth, T.

Both hypoxemia and a prothrombotic diathesis have been associated with more severe disease and increased risk of death. To date, specific indications to treat this condition are lacking. This was a single center, investigator initiated, compassionate use, proof of concept, case control, phase IIb study (NCT04368377) conducted in the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit of L. Sacco University Hospital in Milano, Italy. Our objective was to explore the effects of the administration of anti-platelet therapy on arterial oxygenation and clinical outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 with hypercoagulability. We enrolled five consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe respiratory failure requiring helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a pro-thrombotic state identified as a D-dimer \u003E 3 times the upper limit of normal. Five patients matched for age, D-dimer value and SOFA score formed the control group. Beyond standard of care, treated patients received 25 \u00B5g/Kg/body weight tirofiban as bolus infusion, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 \u00B5g/Kg/body weight per minute for 48 hours. Before tirofiban, patients received acetylsalicylic acid 250 mg infusion and oral clopidogrel 300 mg; both were continued at a dose of 75 mg daily for 30 days. Fondaparinux2.5 mg/day sub-cutaneous was given for the duration of the hospital stay. All controls were receiving prophylactic or therapeutic dose heparin, according to local standard operating procedures. Treated patients consistently experienced a mean (SD) reduction in A-a O2 gradient of -32.6 mmHg (61.9, P = 0.154), -52.4 mmHg (59.4, P = 0.016) and -151.1 mmHg (56.6, P = 0.011; P = 0.047 vs. controls) at 24, 48 hours and 7 days after treatment. PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased by 52 mmHg (50, P = 0.172), 64 mmHg (47, P = 0.040) and 112 mmHg (51, P = 0.036) after 24, 48 hours and 7 days, respectively. All patients but one were successfully weaned from CPAP after 3 days. This was not true for the control group. No major adverse events were observed. Antiplatelet therapy might be effective in improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio in Covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure. The effects might be sustained by the prevention and interference on forming clots in lung capillary vessels and by modulating megakaryocytes\u2019 function and platelet adhesion. Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to confirm these results.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viecca, Maurizio; Radovanovic, Dejan; Forleo, Giovanni Battista; Santus, Pierachille","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2077811d7ad111a9e899a04aa783ed980dcc6c8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661820312585; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820312585?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["L.

Results: 16 placentas from patients with SARS-CoV-2 were examined (15 with live birth in the 3rd trimester 1 delivered in the 2nd trimester after intrauterine fetal demise). Compared to controls, third trimester placentas were significantly more likely to show at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), including abnormal or injured maternal vessels, as well as delayed villous maturation, chorangiosis, and intervillous thrombi. Rates of acute and chronic inflammation were not increased. The placenta from the patient with intrauterine fetal demise showed villous edema and a retroplacental hematoma. Conclusions: Relative to controls, COVID-19 placentas show increased prevalence of features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), a pattern of placental injury reflecting abnormalities in oxygenation within the intervillous space associated with adverse perinatal outcomes.

Since then, several deaths have been reported to be caused by BRBV infection in the Midwest and Southern United States. BRBV is a tick-borne virus that is widely carried by lone star ticks. It belongs to genus Thogotovirus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. Currently, there are no treatments or vaccines available for BRBV or thogotovirus infection caused diseases. In this study, we reconstituted a replicon reporter system, composed of plasmids expressing the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex (PA, PB1 and PB2), nucleocapsid (NP) protein, and a reporter gene flanked by the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 UTR of the envelope glycoprotein (GP) genome segment. By using the luciferase reporter, we screened a few small molecule compounds of anti-endonuclease that inhibited the nicking activity by parvovirus B19 (B19V) NS1, as well as FDA-approved drugs targeting the RdRP of influenza virus. Our results demonstrated that myricetin, and an anti-B19V NS1 nicking inhibitor, efficiently inhibited the RdRP activity of BRBV and virus replication. The IC50 and EC50 of myricetin are 2.22 \u03BCM and 4.6 \u03BCM, respectively, in cells. Myricetin had minimal cytotoxicity in cells, and therefore the therapeutic index of the compound is high. In conclusion, the BRBV replicon system is a useful tool to study viral RNA replication and to develop antivirals, and myricetin may hold promise in treatment of BRBV infected patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hao, Siyuan; Ning, Kang; Wang, Xiaomei; Wang, Jianke; Cheng, Fang; Ganaie, Safder S.; Tavis, John E.; Qiu, Jianming","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0008556448745586b34e736c231fea9af7cb19d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.058693","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRBV"],"locations":["Midwest","Southern United States"],"keyphrases":["BRBV infection","RdRP activity of BRBV","BRBV replicon system","virus replication","RdRP of influenza virus","treatment of BRBV infected patients","EC50 of myricetin","Bourbon virus","tick-borne virus","replicon reporter system","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","viral RNA replication","anti-B19V NS1","thogotovirus infection","nicking activity","reporter gene","luciferase reporter","cells","\u03BCM","study","genus Thogotovirus","small molecule compounds of anti-endonuclease","complex","useful tool","plasmids","envelope glycoprotein","GP","PB2","PB1","Midwest","parvovirus B19","vaccines available","inhibitor","FDA-approved drugs","genome segment","nucleocapsid","therapeutic index","Southern United States","NP","antivirals","UTR","Orthomyxoviridae family","treatments","minimal cytotoxicity","diseases","conclusion","University of Kansas Hospital","lone star ticks","IC50","results","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Abstract The transfusion of labile blood products is vital and essential for patients in absence of alternative treatment. Patients and doctors have always feared transfusion-transmitted infections by blood, blood components and blood-derived drugs. Photochemical inactivation of platelet concentrates and plasma, using a technique associating amotosalen and UVA, has been used for five years in a French region for the whole population and a large spectrum of patients, with efficacy and safety. It would seem wise to introduce labile blood products, submitted to pathogen inactivation by a technique already approved by a regulatory agency and not to wait for a perfect system including red blood cells concentrates. Universal implementation of pathogen inactivation in labile blood products is a major and key step to improve safety against infection in transfusion.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cazenave, J.-P.","journal":"Transfusion Clinique et Biologique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55157c44c76462ee5d92ab58db2061b5efcef975.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1246782011000607; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1246782011000607","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transfusion des produits sanguins labiles","blood components","transfusion du sang","pathogen inactivation in labile blood products is","inactivation photochimique","Photochemical inactivation","patients in absence","submitted to pathogen inactivation","labile blood products is vital","Abstract The transfusion","to wait for","always feared transfusion","It would seem wise to introduce labile blood products","including red blood cells concentrates","key step to improve safety against infection in transfusion","large spectre de patients","technique associating amotosalen","five years in","plasma","technique already approved","UVA","alternative th\u00E9rapeutique","the whole population","agents infectieux pathog\u00E8nes","large spectrum","platelet concentrates","th\u00E9rapeutique essentielle","concentr\u00E9s plaquettaires","alternative treatment","place universelle","concentr\u00E9s de globules rouges","cl\u00E9 de la s\u00E9curit\u00E9 infectieuse","major","perfect","French region","transmitted infections","regulatory agency","using","\u00E9tape majeure","used","m\u00E9dicaments d\u00E9riv\u00E9s","Universal implementation","vitale","with efficacy","doctors","syst\u00E8me parfait \u00E9tendu","efficacit\u00E9","derived drugs","r\u00E9gion fran\u00E7aise","transmission","mise","malades","m\u00E9decins"],"language":"fr"},

Importantly, individuals who already live with mental disorders may be particularly vulnerable to the psychological stress associated with the pandemic. However, data on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects this group of people is largely absent from the literature. Here, we report data from a quality development project conducted at the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region (CDR), which has a catchment area of approximately 1.3 million people covered by five psychiatric hospitals providing inpatient and outpatient treatment of all types of mental disorders. Based on a manual screening of all clinical notes from the period from February 1st to March 23rd 2020 that contained at least one of the following words: corona, COVID, virus, epidemic, pandemic, and contaminate/contamination (including compound words), we found 1357 notes from 918 adult patients that described pandemic-related psychopathology (symptoms that appeared to be caused/deteriorated by the pandemic and/or its societal consequences). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of COVID-19 pandemic-related psychopathology from a large psychiatric treatment setting. The results clearly suggest that this phenomenon exists among individuals with mental illness. However, as the data from this investigation stems from standard clinical practice where the patients were not systematically assessed for pandemic-related psychopathology, we cannot speak to its overall prevalence. Nevertheless, we believe that our findings underline the necessity of taking urgent action to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with mental disorders. A low-cost intervention would be to simply discuss the ongoing pandemic and its societal consequences with patients seeking care in psychiatric settings - as this may lead to relief of pandemic-related symptoms via general comforting, and clarification of misunderstandings/false beliefs regarding the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rohde, C.; Hougaard Jefsen, O.; Noerremark, B.; Aalkjaer Danielsen, A.; Dinesen Ostergaard, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4575bdc896422190e0a6a203bc306c39a2e895f4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20067744v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relief of pandemic","ongoing pandemic","pandemic-related psychopathology","societal consequences","investigation of COVID","related symptoms","data","types of mental disorders","psychiatric services","psychiatric hospitals","psychiatric settings","adult patients","significant consequences","mental illness","large psychiatric treatment setting","clinical notes","individuals","major health consequences way","consequential societal changes","outpatient treatment","investigation stems","group of people","following words","compound words","virus infection","standard clinical practice","clarification of misunderstandings","general comforting","Central Denmark Region","corona","care","quality development project","urgent action","negative effects","CDR","phenomenon","false beliefs","epidemic","necessity","medical fields","manual screening","psychological stress","contamination","catchment area","findings","literature","period","overall prevalence","low-cost intervention","results","knowledge","psychiatry"],"language":"en"},

Besides a standard geometric Brownian motion, another two driving processes are taken into account: a stationary Poisson point process and a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain. The classical harvesting problem for this model is a big difficult puzzle since the corresponding Fokker\u2013Planck equations with three types of noise are very difficult to solve. Our main goal of this paper is to work out the optimization problem with respect to stationary probability density. One of the main contributions is to provide a new equivalent approach to overcome this problem. More precisely, an ergodic method is used to show the almost surely equivalency between the time averaging yield and sustainable yield. Results show that the optimal strategy changes with environment. An interesting thing is that the optimal strategy for each state is equivalent to the global optimality.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zou, Xiaoling; Wang, Ke","journal":"Nonlinear Analysis: Hybrid Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb68173ed9ade0c27573673e9a45ef1be8191edc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1751570X14000065; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751570X14000065","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimization problem of fishing","classical harvesting problem","paper","time averaging yield","optimal strategy changes","sustainable yield","main contributions","main goal","continuous-time finite-state Markov chain","stochastic logistic model","big difficult puzzle","stationary probability density","new equivalent approach","stationary Poisson point process","corresponding Fokker","account","Planck equations","respect","driving processes","types of noise","standard geometric Brownian motion","interesting thing","global optimality","Results","environment","equivalency","ergodic method"],"language":"en"},

Testing results have struggled with the relative capabilities, testing policies and preparedness of each affected country, making their comparison a non-trivial task. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases, the reported virus mortality is likely inflated in most countries. Lockdowns and changes in human behavior modulate the underlying growth rate of the virus. Under-sampling of infection cases may lead to the under-estimation of total cases, resulting in systematic mortality estimation biases. For healthcare systems worldwide it is important to know the expected number of cases that will need treatment. In this manuscript, we identify a generalizable growth rate decay reflecting behavioral change. We propose a method to correct the reported COVID-19 cases and death numbers by using a benchmark country (South Korea) with near-optimal testing coverage, with considerations on population demographics. We extrapolate expected deaths and hospitalizations with respect to observations in countries that passed the exponential growth curve. By applying our correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries and a significant burden on worldwide hospital capacity.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lachmann, Alexander; Jagodnik, Kathleen M; Giorgi, Federico Manuel; Ray, Forest","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca1351c4073b53c81ea950d9fbbda67c50af293d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036178","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["mild cases","severe cases","current cases","expected number of cases","under-estimation of total cases","Under-sampling of infection cases","countries","reported virus mortality","reported COVID","underlying growth rate","generalizable growth rate decay","testing policies","higher rate","Testing results","healthcare systems","likely lead","optimal testing coverage","exponential growth curve","worldwide hospital capacity","benchmark country","affected country","systematic mortality estimation biases","expected deaths","preparedness","human behavior","relative capabilities","significant burden","death numbers","comparison","considerations","observations","hospitalizations","respect","behavioral change","South Korea","changes","population demographics","fatal outcomes","non-trivial task","Lockdowns","months","matter","manuscript","method","treatment","correction"],"language":"en"},

The chest computed tomography (CT) could be serve as an effective tool in detection of COVID-19. Its valuable to develop automatic detection of COVID-19. Material and Methods: The collected dataset consisted of 521 COVID-19 chest CT images, 397 normal chest CT images, 76 bacterial pneumonia chest CT images and 48 SARS chest CT images obtained by exhaustively searching available data on the Internet. Then, these data are divided into three sets, referred to training set, validation set and testing set. Sixteen data augmentation operations are designed to enrich the training set in deep learning training phase. Multiple experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the model in the detection of COVID-19 both in case of no noisy labels and noisy labels. The performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Results: The data augmentation operations on the training set is effective for improvement of the model performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.9689 with (95% CI: 0.9308, 1) in case of no noisy labels, while the per-exam sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting COVID-19 in the independent testing set are 90.52%, 91.58% and 91.21%, respectively. Besides, the model is robust when part of the training samples is marked incorrectly. The AUC is 92.23% in the case of noisy labels of 10% in the training set.

Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hongdou; Wang, Shuang; Zhong, Fan; Bao, Wuyin; Li, Yipeng; Liu, Lei; Wang, Hongyan; He, Yungang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027672","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["high mortality risk","mortality rate","mortality risks of COVID","general public","low incidence risk","global public health","young people","infected patients","people older","viral infection","Coronavirus Disease","New coronavirus SARS-CoV","big challenge","individuals","effective management","fatal cases","good medical service","age composition","world","thousands of lives","study","China","result","outbreak","seniors","months","years","report"],"language":"en"},

To date, however, no large sample size study focusing on gastrointestinal symptoms in pediatric cases has been published. We analyzed COVID-19 infected children in Wuhan who presented with initial GI symptoms to determine the GI characteristics and epidemiological trend of the disease. Design: We retrospectively analyzed 244 children patients confirmed with COVID-19 at Wuhan Children\u0027s Hospital from 21 Jan to 20 Mar 2020. Symptomatic cases were divided into two groups according to whether the patients presented with or without GI symptoms on admission. Demographic, epidemiological, symptoms, and laboratory data were compared. We also analyzed the respective trends of case number changes of GI cases and asymptomatic cases. Results: 34 out of 193 symptomatic children had GI symptoms. They had lower median age and weight, a higher rate of fever, a longer length of stay and more hematological and biochemical abnormalities than patients without GI symptoms. There was no significant difference in chest CT findings or stool SARS-CoV-2 test positive percentages between the two groups. The number of patients admitted with GI symptoms showed an overall downward trend with time. At the time of writing, 242 patients were discharged, one died, and one critically ill patient was still in the intensive care unit. Conclusion: COVID-19 infected children with GI symptoms are prone to presenting with more clinical and laboratory abnormalities than patients without GI symptoms.

The three mechanisms are: 1) The lateral ankle mechanism, an active modulation of ankle inversion/eversion in stance; 2) The foot placement mechanism, an active shift of the swing foot placement; and 3) The push-off mechanism, an active modulation of the ankle plantarflexion angle during double stance. Here we seek to determine whether there are changes in neural control of balance when walking at different cadences and speeds. Twenty-one healthy young adults walked on a self-paced treadmill while immersed in a 3D virtual reality cave, and periodically received balance perturbations (bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation) eliciting a perceived fall to the side. Subjects were instructed to match two cadences specified by a metronome, 110bpm (High) and 80bpm (Low), which led to faster and slower gait speeds, respectively. The results indicate that subjects altered the use of the balance mechanisms at different cadences. The lateral ankle mechanism was used more in the Low condition, while the foot placement mechanism was used more in the High condition. There was no difference in the use of the push-off mechanism between cadence conditions. These results suggest that neural control of balance is altered when gait characteristics such as cadence change, suggesting a flexible balance response that is sensitive to the constraints of the gait cycle. We speculate that the use of the balance mechanisms may be a factor resulting in well-known characteristics of gait in populations with compromised balance control, such as slower gait speed in older adults or higher cadence in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease.","publish_time":"2019-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fettrow, Tyler; Reimann, Hendrik; Grenet, David; Crenshaw, Jeremy; Higginson, Jill; Jeka, John","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/faf471340dd3ee373c1457ce2cdfe98c0d43dd5e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/658070","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["balance mechanisms","balance perturbations","neural control of balance","compromised balance control","foot placement mechanism","lateral ankle mechanism","use","flexible balance response","gait characteristics","gait cycle","slower gait speeds","well-known characteristics of gait","active modulation of ankle inversion","different cadences","young healthy adults","healthy young adults","swing foot placement","active shift","older adults","higher cadence","cadence change","ankle plantarflexion angle","cadence conditions","push","bpm","Low condition","High condition","results","Subjects","double stance","bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation","people","populations","eversion","factor","self-paced treadmill","D virtual reality cave","Parkinson\u2019s disease","constraints","perceived fall","metronome","difference"],"language":"en"},

RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before its availability to the population. The use of the synthetic RT-qPCR target to investigate novel assays diagnostic parameters in automated workflows is a quick, simple effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats.

Several outbreak models have been developed to investigate the effects of different public health strategies for COVID-19, but they have not been developed for Pakistan and other South East Asian countries, where a large proportion of global population resides. Methods: We developed a stochastic individual contact model by extending the widely-used Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment model with additional compartments to model both anticipated mitigating effects of public health intervention strategies for Pakistan. We estimated the projected spread, number of hospitalizations, and case fatalities under no intervention and four increasingly stringent public health strategies of social distancing and self-isolation at the national and provincial levels of Pakistan. Results: Our analysis shows that without any public health interventions the expected number of cumulative case fatalities is 671,596 in Pakistan with the virus is expected to peak in terms of the number of required ICU-hospitalizations at 198,593 persons by the end of the June 2020. The estimated total numbers of cumulative case fatalities are lower for other public health strategies with strict social distancing showing the lowest number of deaths at 1,588 (Self-isolation: n=341,359; Flexible social distancing strategy: n=3,995; and Exit strategy: n=28,214). The lowest number of required ICU-hospitalization is also estimated for strict social distancing strategy (n=266 persons at the end of May 2020). Generally, the simulated effects of the different public health strategies at the provincial-level were similar to the national-level with strict social distancing showing the fewest number of case fatalities and ICU-hospitalizations. Conclusion: Our results indicate that case fatalities and ICU-hospitalizations for Pakistan will be high without any public health interventions. While strict social distancing can potentially prevent a large number of deaths and ICU-hospitalizations, the government faces an important dilemma of potentially severe economic downfall. Consideration of a temporary strict social distancing strategy with gradual return of the lower-risk Pakistani population, as simulated in our exit strategy scenario, may an effective compromise between public health and economy of Pakistani population.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhutta, Z.

In this study, post-translational modification (PTM) of recombinant HCoV-19 S and hACE2 were characterized by LC-MSMS. We revealed that both proteins were highly decorated with specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes. Out of 21 possible glycosites in HCoV-19 S protein, 20 were confirmed completely occupied by N-glycans, with oligomannose glycans being the most abundant type. All 7 possible glycosylation sites in hACE2 were completely occupied mainly by complex type N-glycans. However, we showed that glycosylation did not directly contribute to the binding affinity between SARS-CoV spike protein and hACE2. Additionally, we also identified multiple sites methylated in both proteins, and multiple prolines in hACE2 were converted to hydroxylproline. Refined structural models were built by adding N-glycan and PTMs to recently published cryo-EM structure of the HCoV-19 S and hACE2 generated with glycosylation sites in the vicinity of binding surface.

Methods: A simulation study was conducted on current, nationwide, patient-led triage systems from three countries with low case fatality rates (Singapore, Norway and Japan) and two countries with high case fatality rates (the USA and the UK). 36 case scenarios were designed to imitate common presentations of COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity. These scenarios were then fed into each countrys patient-led triage system. The advice for each scenario was recorded and then compared. Results: Patient-led triage systems from Singapore, Japan and Norway maintained a low threshold for advising clinical contact for patients with possible COVID-19 (88 to 100% of cases were referred). Patient-led triage systems from the USA and the UK maintained high thresholds for advising contact with either call centre support or clinical contact (28 and 33% of cases were referred, respectively), and triaged the majority of cases home with no further healthcare input. There was a strong inverse correlation between percentage of cases referred and the nations case fatality rate (Pearsons Correlation = -0.642, p = 0.01). Conclusion: In this simulation study, countries with low case fatality rates - Singapore, Norway and Japan -, performed well, successfully identifying severe COVID-19 and triaging such cases to medical care. The USA triage system (CDCs Coronavirus Self-Checker) and the UKs triage system (NHS 111 online) performed poorly, failing to identify Severe COVID-19 infection and sepsis in the case simulations, and triaging the majority of cases to self-care with no further healthcare input. Such poorly performing triage systems are likely to be contributing to the high case fatality rates in the US and the UK.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mansab, F.; Bhatti, S.; Goyal, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7ea996412373c9fe0c1a3c6dc7ff577edc01799.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20084079v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA","UK"],"locations":["Japan","Norway"],"keyphrases":["triage systems","high case fatality rates","case scenarios","low case fatality rates - Singapore","USA triage system","case simulations","triage pathways","nations case fatality rate","UKs triage system","severe COVID","possible COVID","percentage of cases","Norway","Japan","countrys patient","majority of cases home","common presentations of COVID","different countries","clinical contact","healthcare input","low threshold","high thresholds","simulation study","differing healthcare models","Pearsons Correlation","strong inverse correlation","related health advice","CDCs Coronavirus Self-Checker","patients","infection","sepsis","centre support","self-care","approaches","varying degrees of severity","NHS","Introduction","Results","number of factors","Methods","Conclusion","medical care","disparity","world"],"language":"en"},

Design Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting 16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020. Participants 150 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 were assigned to SOC alone (control group). Interventions HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively). Main outcome measures The primary endpoint was the 28-day negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2. The assessed secondary endpoints were negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21, the improvement rate of clinical symptoms within 28-day, normalization of C-reactive protein and blood lymphocyte count within 28-day. Primary and secondary analysis was by intention to treat. Adverse events were assessed in the safety population. Results The overall 28-day negative conversion rate was not different between SOC plus HCQ and SOC group (Kaplan-Meier estimates 85.4% versus 81.3%, P=0.341). Negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21 was also similar between the two groups. No different 28-day symptoms alleviation rate was observed between the two groups. A significant efficacy of HCQ on alleviating symptoms was observed when the confounding effects of anti-viral agents were removed in the post-hoc analysis (Hazard ratio, 8.83, 95%CI, 1.09 to 71.3). This was further supported by a significantly greater reduction of CRP (6.986 in SOC plus HCQ versus 2.723 in SOC, milligram/liter, P=0.045) conferred by the addition of HCQ, which also led to more rapid recovery of lymphopenia, albeit no statistical significance. Adverse events were found in 8.8% of SOC and 30% of HCQ recipients with two serious adverse events. The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea (10%). Conclusions The administration of HCQ did not result in a higher negative conversion rate but more alleviation of clinical symptoms than SOC alone in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without receiving antiviral treatment, possibly through anti-inflammatory effects. Adverse events were significantly increased in HCQ recipients but no apparently increase of serious adverse events.

Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating their spread across countries. In this study, we collected and analyzed 3,067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 59 countries during the first three months after the onset of this virus. Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 716 site mutations, of which 457 (64%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 39 recurrent non-synonymous mutations, including 10 hotspot mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six genes of SARS-CoV-2. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed certain genotypes specific to the geographic location. We also found co-occurring mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Thus, evolution over time has shown a mechanism of co-accumulation and the phylogenetic analysis of this population indicated that this virus can be divided into 3 clades, including a subgroup-specific to the genomes of the United States. On the other hand, analysis of the selective pressure revealed the presence of several negatively selected residues that could be useful for considerations as therapeutic target design.

Results: Implementing SD only delayed the appearance of peak prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Doubling of hospital beds could not reduce the fatal cases probably due to its overwhelming number compared to the hospital beds. Increasing detection rates could significantly flatten the curve and reduce the peak prevalence of cases (increasing detection rate by 5 times could reduce case number to half).

In order to quantify the risk posed by COVID-19 infectors exhaling respiratory aerosols in enclosed spaces, we undertook a computer modelling study to simulate transmission in an office building. Methods Respiratory droplet data from four published datasets were analysed to quantify the number and volume of droplets \u003C100m diameter produced by a typical cough and speaking event (i.e. counting from 1 to 100). This was used in a stochastic model to simulate (10,000 simulations) the number of respiratory particles, originating from a COVID-19 infector, that would be inhaled in one hour by a susceptible individual practicing socially distancing in a 5 x 5 x 2.75m office space. Several scenarios were simulated that mimicked the presence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 infectors. Results On average, each cough and speaking event produced similar numbers of droplets \u003C100 m diameter (median range = 955 - 1010). Computer simulations (at ventilation rate = 2AC/h) revealed that sharing the office space with a symptomatic COVID-19 infector (4 coughs per hour) for one hour resulted in the inhalation of 187.3 (median value) respiratory droplets, whereas sharing with an asymptomatic COVID-19 positive person (10 speaking events per hour) resulted in the inhalation of 482.9 droplets. Increasing the ventilation rate resulted in only modest reductions in particle numbers inhaled. Conclusions Given that live SARS-CoV-2 virions are known to be shed in high concentrations from the nasal cavity of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, the results suggest that individuals who share enclosed spaces with an infector may be at risk of contracting COVID-19 by the aerosol route, even when practicing social distancing.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beggs, C.

All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR or chest computer tomography (CT).The survivors were followed up until March 4,2020. Clinical data, including demographic characteristic, presentation, exposure history, laboratory examination, radiology and prognosis were enrolled and analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software. Results There were 197 adult discharged patients with COVID-19 in this study. Statistical analysis indicated that the average age was 55.94 years, and female patients were 50.3%. Those patients mainly resided in urban with exposure history in 2 weeks. Fever, cough and weakness were the common symptoms. Leucocytes were mainly normal or decreased in 185 patents, both lymphocytes and eosinophils reduced, the ratios were 56.9% and 50.3%, respectively. On the contrary, lactate dehydrogenases raised in 65 patients. C-reactive protein elevated in the most of patients. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 63.5%. Chest CT indicated that bilateral patchy shadows were the most common imaging manifestations.169 patients recovered and transferred to a designated hospital for observation, and the others turned worst and died of acute respiratory failure. Conclusion COIVD-19 infection have become a life-threaten public health problem, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was limited. Chest CT scan was recommended for the suspected patients. Moreover, lymphocytopenia and eosinophils declining without leukocytes increasing may be considered as a useful evidence for the diagnosis.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Fating; Yu, Xiaogang; Tong, Xiaowei; Zhang, Rong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce0c3e05715871dda6204ee0c52bcc95d2b89b91.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20041426","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chest CT"],"locations":["Yichang"],"keyphrases":["female patients","suspected patients","adult discharged patients","clinical features of discharged adult patients","cases of COVID","sensitivity of RT","Chest CT scan","real-time RT-PCR","Yichang Central People\u0027s Hospital","exposure history","designated hospital","eosinophils","chest computer tomography","Clinical data","common symptoms","retrospective study","common imaging manifestations","presentation","laboratory examination","radiology","demographic characteristic","bilateral patchy shadows","prognosis","epidemiology","public health problem","average age","life","cough","weakness","years","infection","Statistical analysis","SPSS","patents","lymphocytes","Method","weeks","lactate dehydrogenases","Results","C-reactive protein","acute respiratory failure","useful evidence","diagnosis","Conclusion COIVD","software","Fever","lymphocytopenia","leukocytes","ratios","Purpose","observation","survivors","Leucocytes"],"language":"en"},

Based on single-cell transcriptomes of nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples from clinically well-characterized patients presenting with moderate and critical severities, we reveal the different types and states of airway epithelial cells that are vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In COVID-19 patients, we observed a two- to threefold increase of cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 within the airway epithelial cell compartment. ACE2 is upregulated in epithelial cells through Interferon signals by immune cells suggesting that the viral defense system may increase the number of potentially susceptible cells in the respiratory epithelium. Infected epithelial cells recruit and activate immune cells by chemokine signaling. Recruited T lymphocytes and inflammatory macrophages were hyperactivated and showed a strong interaction with epithelial cells. In critical patients, increased expression of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL8, IL1B and TNF in macrophages was identified as a likely cause of a hyperinflammatory lung pathology. Moreover, we observed exacerbated epithelial cell death, likely leading to lung injury and respiratory failure in fatal cases.

Easy to implement, predictive multiscale modeling frameworks to integrate the wide variety of clinical and research datasets into actionable insights, which could inform therapeutic regime strategies are lacking. We present a multiscale, multicellular, spatiotemporal model of the infection of epithelial tissue by a generic virus, a simplified cellular immune response and viral and immune-induced tissue damage. Our initial model is built of modular components to allow it to be easily extended and adapted in a collaborative fashion to describe specific viral infections, tissue types and immune responses. The model allows us to define three parameter regimes: where viral infection coincides with a massive cytopathic effect, where the immune system rapidly controls the virus and where the immune system controls the virus but extensive tissue damage occurs. We use the model in a proof-of-concept application to evaluate a number of drug therapy concepts. Inhibition of viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment lead to containment of infection. Fast viral internalization and slower immune response lead to uncontrolled spread of infection. Simulation of a drug, whose mode of action is to reduce production of viral RNAs, shows that a relatively limited reduction of viral replication at the beginning of infection greatly decreases the total area of tissue damage and maximal viral load, while even a treatment that greatly reduces the rate of genomic replication rapidly loses efficacy as the infection progresses. A number of simulation conditions lead to stochastically variable outcomes, with some replicas clearing or controlling the virus, while others see virus-induced damage sweep the simulated lung patch. The model is open-source and modular, allowing rapid development and extension of its components by groups working in parallel. Author summary Development of detailed predictive quantitative models of all aspects of COVID-19 is essential for rapidly understanding the causes of differing disease infection outcomes and vulnerabilities, suggesting drug and therapeutic targets, and designing optimized personalized interventions. We present an easy-to-implement, modular modeling framework representing molecular, cellular, tissue, and whole-body scales of virus infection and immune response that researchers and clinicians could use as a tool to rapidly test hypotheses concerning the origins of different disease outcomes and therapeutic regime strategies. The model is open-source and modular, allowing rapid development and extension of its components by groups working in parallel.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sego, T.J.; Aponte-Serrano, Josua O.; Ferrari Gianlupi, Juliano; Heaps, Samuel R.; Breithaupt, Kira; Brusch, Lutz; Osborne, James M.; Quardokus, Ellen M.; Glazier, James A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/496afa2ff2af1cf32cd64e9fcdf9f0675dfe1222.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.064139","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune system","immune-induced tissue damage","infection of epithelial tissue","immune responses","beginning of infection","containment of infection","whole-body scales of virus infection","virus-induced damage","causes of differing disease infection outcomes","slower immune response lead","Fast viral internalization","Inhibition of viral internalization","extensive tissue damage","simplified cellular immune response","tissue types","generic virus","modular components","spatiotemporal model","initial model","specific viral infections","maximal viral load","production of viral RNAs","uncontrolled spread of infection","therapeutic targets","limited reduction of viral replication","total area of tissue damage","rapid development","faster immune-cell recruitment lead","Development of predictive quantitative models","causes of differing disease outcomes","therapeutic regime strategies","variable outcomes","modular modeling framework","origins of different disease outcomes","vulnerabilities","Author summary Development of detailed predictive quantitative models","extension","predictive multiscale modeling frameworks","aspects of COVID","open-source","number of drug therapy concepts","optimized personalized interventions","groups","number of simulation conditions","rate of genomic replication","wide variety of clinical","research datasets","actionable insights","massive cytopathic effect","researchers","simulated lung patch","hypotheses","collaborative fashion","efficacy","mode of action","clinicians","concept application","parameter regimes","proof","treatment","replicas","tool"],"language":"en"},

There is currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also has important implications in vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Huibin; Wu, Nicholas C.; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Yuan, Meng; Perera, Ranawaka A.

Here we present simplified arithmetic models of COVID-19 transmission, control and elimination in user-friendly Shiny and Excel formats that allow non-specialists to explore, query, critique and understand the containment decisions facing their country and the world at large. Based on parameter values representative of the United Republic of Tanzania, which is still early enough in its epidemic cycle and response to avert a national catastrophe, national containment and elimination with less than 10 deaths is predicted for highly rigorous lock down within 5 weeks of the first confirmed cases and maintained for 15 weeks. However, elimination may only be sustained if case importation from outside the country is comprehensively contained by isolating for three weeks all incoming travellers, except those from countries certified as COVID-free in the future. Any substantive relaxation of these assumptions, specifically shortening the lock-down period, less rigorous lock-down or imperfect importation containment, may facilitate epidemic re-initiation, resulting in over half a million deaths unless rigorously contained a second time. Removing contact tracing and isolation has minimal impact on successful containment trajectories because high incidence of similar mild symptoms caused by other common pathogens attenuates detection success of COVID-19 testing. Nevertheless, contact tracing is recommended as an invaluable epidemiological surveillance platform for monitoring and characterizing the epidemic, and for understanding the influence of interventions on transmission dynamics.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Killeen, G.; Kiware, S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/688cde553b8f04938dc6d42c17e9366c5cfca023.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.15.20066845v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United Republic"],"keyphrases":["national containment","rigorous lock","containment decisions","elimination","weeks","COVID-free","imperfect importation containment","successful containment trajectories","detection success of COVID","individual countries","national catastrophe","national-level epidemics","epidemic re-initiation","transmission dynamics","local transmission","epidemic cycle","contact tracing","country","deaths","simplified arithmetic models of COVID","realistic way","case importation","influence of interventions","global level","difficult decisions","virus pandemic","re-open trade","minimal impact","high incidence of similar mild symptoms","common pathogens","Excel formats","isolation","non-specialists","monitoring","control","invaluable epidemiological surveillance platform","United Republic of Tanzania","parameter values representative","international co-operation","query","critique","response","public health catastrophes","ongoing novel coronavirus","testing","assumptions","confirmed cases","incoming travellers","substantive relaxation","people","future","world\u0027s population","extended periods","time","remainder","need"],"language":"en"},

Worldwide, more than 100 countries have imposed severe restrictions regarding freedom of movement amongst their citizens in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. These restrictions, which are part of a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions, have recently been classified by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) team and a nominal index measure has been defined for use by the wider international community. We address the use of this index measure to establish the degree and characteristics of control of the transmission rate of the virus within a representative sample of countries in the World and states in the United States of America. Methods Country specific, Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deaths (SIRD) models with latent dynamics were constructed using publicly available data for 23 countries and 25 states of the United States of America. Each of the models were linearised and classical frequentist error propagation was applied to them individually. The time varying, observable model parameters were extracted for each day that data was made available. The OxCGRT stringency index, p, was used to regress against these model parameters. The regression of the transmission rate as a function of p in each locale was through a linear parameter _s. In addition, macroscopic indices from the World Bank were used to explore inter-country variation in the measured parameters. Results The world average was _s=0.01 (95% CI 0.0102 - 0.0112) with an ensemble standard deviation of 0.0017 (95% C.I. 0.0014 - 0.0021), strongly indicating a universal behavior. While lockdown measures have been successful in curbing the spread, our study indicates that removing them too swiftly will result in the resurgence of the spread within one to two months. Reducing the stringency index by 10 will delay reaching the apex by about 6 months, where reducing it by 20 will delay by only four months. During the post-lockdown period it is essential to increase _s. For the system to remain sub-critical, the rate with which _s increases should outpace that of the decrease of the stringency index. The spread of the virus is found to be insensitive to the Gini index and other socio-economic indexes. The typical adjustment time to see the effects of control varied between 1.49 days for Peru and 38.09 days for Sweden. In the United States, the typical adjustment time to see the effects of control varied between 1.41 days for Colorado to 15.91 days for Ohio. Interpretation Given the measured characterisations of each locale, the effects of any change in non-pharmaceutical intervention may be anticipated and predictions can be made regarding the possible case load which is specific to that environment. This is accomplished by specifying an acceptable level of transmission, {beta}_f, given the prevailing economic and social constraints which uniquely determines an overall stringency of intervention level p. As a policy maker, there are possible intervention combinations to choose from and a combination must be selected that achieves p or greater.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naude, J.; Mellado, B.; Choma, J.; Correa, F.; Dahbi, S.; Dwolatzky, B.; Dwolatzky, L.; Hayasi, K.; Lieberman, B.; Maslo, C.; Monnakgotla, K.; Ruan, X.; Stevenson, F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9af2fccfec7288912a02348c42c49a6f8fb3abde.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.30.20085316v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker","World Bank"],"locations":["United States of America","Peru","Sweden","United States","Colorado"],"keyphrases":["days","OxCGRT stringency index","virus","spread","Gini index","United States of America","effects of control","transmission rate","nominal index measure","months","overall stringency of intervention level","measured parameters","typical adjustment time","World Bank","time varying","possible intervention combinations","characteristics of control","locale","acceptable level of transmission","world average","models","use","observable model parameters","function of p","available data","Methods Country specific","representative sample of countries","measured characterisations","set of non-pharmaceutical interventions","Oxford COVID","severe restrictions","Background COVID","s increases","lockdown measures","inter-country variation","possible case load","post-lockdown period","team","Government Response Tracker","Susceptible-Infected","policy maker","Deaths","SIRD","addition","freedom of movement","latent dynamics","change","social constraints","macroscopic indices","beta","degree","Peru","Colorado","classical frequentist error propagation","linear parameter","citizens","wider international community","bid","socio-economic indexes","predictions","decrease","ensemble standard deviation","system","environment","Interpretation","Sweden","Ohio","regression","global pandemic","universal behavior","apex","study","resurgence"],"language":"en"},

The World Health Organization has declared the 2014\u20132015 Ebola Virus Disease outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In response to this, preparations were made in various health facilities and entry points across Ghana. This study explored health workers perceptions, and attitude about Ghana\u2019s preparedness towards preventing and containing Ebola Virus Disease. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study in five (5) of the ten (10) regions in Ghana. Five focus group discussions (N = 44) were conducted among nurses; one in each region. In addition, ten (10) health workers (2 in each region) who are members of regional Ebola Virus Disease task force were recruited and interviewed. In the Greater Accra, Volta and Western regions that have ports, six (6) port health officials: two in each of these regions were also interviewed. The interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the transcripts with the aid of NVivo 10 software. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that Ghanaian health workers perceived the screening at various ports as important and ongoing but felt that the screenings at in-land ports were being undermined by the use of unapproved routes. Training of health workers was also being carried out in all the regions, however, there was a general perception among 33 out of 44 nurses that majority of health workers have not received training on Ebola Virus Disease prevention and management. Logistical challenges were also reported as some health facilities did not have adequate Personal Protective Equipment. In facilities where equipment was available, they were stored in places which are not easily accessible to health workers at all times of the day. Human resource preparation was also perceived to be a challenge as health workers (38/44 of nurses) generally expressed fear and unwillingness to work in Ebola treatment centres in the event of an outbreak in Ghana. CONCLUSIONS: Our study concludes that preparatory work for Ebola Virus Disease prevention and containment in Ghana is perceived as inadequate by health workers. Ghana needs to strengthen preparation in the area of training of health workers, provision and accessibility of Personal Protective Equipment and incentives for health workers to better position her to contain and manage any Ebola Virus Disease outbreak.","publish_time":"2017-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adongo, Philip Baba; Tabong, Philip Teg-Nefaah; Asampong, Emmanuel; Ansong, Joana; Robalo, Magda; Adanu, Richard M.","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/034f3bdf7e881efa5679fe745b30521a05d292a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5389014.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5389014/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Ebola Virus Disease","Personal Protective Equipment"],"locations":["Ghana","Ebola"],"keyphrases":["Training of health workers","health workers perceptions","Ghanaian health workers","majority of health workers","various health facilities","Ebola Virus Disease outbreak","Ebola Virus Disease prevention","port health officials","World Health Organization","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","members of regional Ebola Virus Disease task force","Ebola treatment centres","nurses","various ports","qualitative study","Western regions","accessibility of Personal Protective Equipment","adequate Personal Protective Equipment","area of training","land ports","RESULTS","preparatory work","Human resource preparation","incentives","provision","containment","Volta","unwillingness","Ghana\u2019s preparedness","attitude","entry points","Greater Accra","preparations","times","better position","management","aid of NVivo","transcripts","focus group discussions","screenings","fear","BACKGROUND","Thematic content analysis","use of unapproved routes","software","places","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","day","general perception","Logistical challenges","response","addition","interviews"],"language":"en"},

There are many factors including pH, salinity, temperature, and turbidity that are known to contribute to the ability of viruses to persist in water. Equine herpesvirus type-1 (EHV-1) is a pathogenic alphaherpesvirus associated with domestic horses and wild equids. EHV-1 and recombinants of EHV-1 and EHV-9 are able to cause infections in non-equid animal species, particularly in captive settings. Many of the captive non-equid mammals are not naturally sympatric with equids and do not share enclosures, however, in many cases water sources may overlap. Similarly, in the wild, equids encounter many species at waterholes in times of seasonal drought. Therefore, we hypothesized that EHV-1 is stable in water and that water may act as a vector for EHV-1. In order to establish the conditions promoting or hindering EHV-1 longevity, infectivity and genomic stability in water; we exposed EHV-1 to varied water environments (pH, salinity, temperature, and turbidity) in controlled experiments over 21 days. The presence and infectivity of the virus was confirmed by both qPCR and cell culture experiments. Our results show that EHV-1 remains stable and infectious under many conditions in water for up to three weeks.","publish_time":"2017-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dayaram, Anisha; Franz, Mathias; Schattschneider, Alexander; Damiani, Armando M.; Bischofberger, Sebastian; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Greenwood, Alex D.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8dc2ba0eb167ca45f16ad38f1d0cca36228ce28f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5399353.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5399353/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hindering EHV","recombinants of EHV","water environments","cases water sources","wild equids","temperature","salinity","infectivity","turbidity","conditions","non-equid animal species","captive non-equid mammals","chemical stability","genomic stability","controlled experiments","captive settings","ability of viruses","cell culture experiments","soil","hard surfaces","environmental vectors","waterholes","domestic horses","infections","transmission","longevity","qPCR","pathogenic alphaherpesvirus","times of seasonal drought","prerequisite","Equine herpesvirus type","factors","days","presence","enclosures","order","weeks","results"],"language":"en"},

The IFNL4-\u0394G genotype, which encodes functional IFN-\u03BB4 protein, is associated with a poor treatment response. In the present study, we investigated the induction and biological effects of IFN-\u03BB4 in HCV-infected hepatocytes and their association with responsiveness to IFN-\u03B1. We also studied the effects of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment on IFN-\u03BB4 expression and IFN-\u03B1 responsiveness. HCV infection induced IFN-\u03BB4 expression at mRNA and protein levels in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). In hepatoma cells, IFNL4 gene transfection or recombinant IFN-\u03BB4 protein treatment robustly increased the protein levels of ISG15 and USP18 in an IFNLR1-dependent manner and potently blocked IFN-\u03B1 signalling. The ISG15/USP18-mediated IFN-\u03B1 unresponsiveness was demonstrated by transfection of siRNAs targeting ISG15 and/or USP18. This potent IFN-\u03BB4 effect was related to prolonged ISG expression after IFNL4 gene transfection. DAA treatment of HCV-infected PHHs reduced the expression of IFN-\u03BBs, including IFN-\u03BB4, and restored IFN-\u03B1 responsiveness. These results demonstrate that virus-induced IFN-\u03BB4 potently blocks IFN-\u03B1 signalling by inducing high protein levels of ISG15 and USP18. Moreover, the data clearly demonstrate that DAA therapy restores IFN-\u03B1 responsiveness in HCV-infected cells.","publish_time":"2017-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sung, Pil Soo; Hong, Seon-Hui; Chung, Jae-Hee; Kim, Sojeong; Park, Su-Hyung; Kim, Ho Min; Yoon, Seung Kew; Shin, Eui-Cheol","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/065a4e7e1e488c1c21dff5602c39e91232a9adbc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5476576.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5476576/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DAA","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of IFN","IFN-\u03BB4 expression","functional IFN-\u03BB4 protein","restored IFN-\u03B1 responsiveness","virus-induced IFN-\u03BB4","recombinant IFN-\u03BB4 protein treatment","blocked IFN-\u03B1 signalling","potent IFN-\u03BB4 effect","biological effects of IFN","USP18-mediated IFN-\u03B1 unresponsiveness","DAA treatment of HCV","HCV-infected hepatocytes","HCV-infected cells","high protein levels of ISG15","IFNL4 gene transfection","HCV infection","infected PHHs","DAA therapy","infected patients","prolonged ISG expression","transfection of siRNAs","IFNL4-\u0394G genotype","poor treatment response","based therapy","hepatoma cells","effects of direct","hepatitis C virus","primary human hepatocytes","mRNA","association","acting antiviral","IFNLR1-dependent manner","induction","responses","\u03BBs","results","present study","Genetic polymorphisms","data"],"language":"en"},

Intraoperative blood transfusion, extensive resection and different comorbidities have been identified. Other parameters, like time of hepatic ischemia, have neither been clinically studied, though experimental studies show that hepatic ischemia can provide lung injury. The objective of this study was to determinate the risk factors of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) after hepatic resection within 7 postoperative days. METHOD: Ninety-four patients consecutively who underwent elective hepatectomy between January and December 2013. Demographic data, pathological variables, and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables had been prospectively collected in a data base. The dependant variables studied were the occurrence of PPCs, defined before analysis of the data. RESULTS: PPCs occurred in 32 (34%) patients. A multivariate analysis allowed identifying the risk factors for PPCs. On multivariate analysis, preoperative gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) elevation OR =5,12 [1,85-15,69] p = 0,002, liver ischemia duration OR = 1,03 [1,01-1,06] p = 0,01 and the intraoperative use of vasopressor OR = 4,40 [1,58-13,36] p = 0,006 were independently associated with PPCs. For every 10 min added in ischemia duration, the OR of the risk of PPCs was estimated to be 1.37 (CI(95%) = [1.08-1.81], p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Three risk factors for PPCs have been identified in a population undergoing liver resection: preoperative GGT elevation, ischemia duration and the intraoperative use of vasopressor. PPCs after liver surgery could be related to lung injury induced by liver ischemia reperfusion and not solely by direct infectious process. That could explain why factors influencing directly or indirectly liver ischemia were independently associated with PPCs.

Although free-grazing duck production has been practised for decades in South-East Asia, there are few published studies describing this production system, which is suspected to play an important role in the maintenance of avian influenza viruses. This study aimed at describing quantitatively the long-distance free-grazing duck production system in South Vietnam, characterising the movement and contact patterns of the duck flocks, and identifying potential associations between farming practices, movement and contact patterns and the circulation of avian influenza viruses. We conducted interviews among stakeholders involved in the free-grazing duck production system (duck farmers, transporters and rice paddy owners) in combination with a virological cross-sectional survey in South Vietnam. Results show that both direct and indirect contacts between free-grazing duck flocks were frequent and diverse. The flocks were transported extensively across district and province boundaries, mainly by boat but also by truck or on foot. A third of the investigated flocks had a positive influenza A virology test, indicating current circulation of avian influenza viruses, but none were positive for H5 subtypes. The age and size of the flock as well as its location at the time of sampling were associated with the risk of influenza A circulation in the flocks. These findings should be considered when developing risk assessment models of influenza virus spread aimed at informing the development of improved biosecurity practices leading to enhanced animal health, sustainable animal production and reliable income for farmers.","publish_time":"2017-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, Anne; Dinh, Tung Xuan; Nhu, Thu Van; Pham, Long Thanh; Newman, Scott; Nguyen, Thuy Thi Thanh; Pfeiffer, Dirk Udo; Vergne, Timoth\u00E9e","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/589fe7dd846e7bbab5e7d6dacf7fab2ca6c4f340.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5478089.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5478089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South-East Asia","South Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["free-grazing duck flocks","risk of influenza","positive influenza","long-distance free-grazing duck production system","duck farmers","maintenance of avian influenza viruses","current circulation of avian influenza viruses","poultry production","grazing ducks","pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks","sustainable animal production","particular of free","investigated flocks","risk assessment models of influenza virus","movement","contact patterns","South Vietnam","important risk factors","South-East Asia","enhanced animal health","public health","farming practices","important role","Presence of ducks","development of improved biosecurity practices","transporters","combination","rice paddy owners","potential associations","virology test","indirect contacts","reliable income","virological cross-sectional survey","farmers\u2019 livelihood","food security","published studies","decades","boat","location","province boundaries","district","stakeholders","time of sampling","truck","age","size","Results","H5 subtypes","interviews","foot","study","findings"],"language":"en"},

The lay press, as well as government and non-government agencies, play a complementary role of extracting findings of high interest or importance and translating them for general viewing. The need for accurate reporting and public advising is paramount when attempting to tackle epidemic outbreaks through behavior change. Yet, public trust in media outlets is at a historic low. The Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model for media reporting on public health emergencies was established in 2005 and has subsequently been used to analyze media reporting on outbreaks of influenza and measles as well as smoking habits and medication compliance. However, no media analysis had yet been performed on the 2013\u20132016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. This study compared the EVD information relayed by lay press sources with general review articles in the academic literature through a mixed-methods analysis. These findings suggest that comprehensive review articles could not serve as a source to clarify and contextualize the uncertainties around the EVD outbreak, perhaps due to adherence to technical accuracy at the expense of clarity within the context of outbreak conditions. This finding does not imply inferiority of the academic literature, nor does it draw direct causation between confusion in review articles and public misunderstanding. Given the erosion of the barriers siloing academia, combined with the demands of today\u2019s fast-paced media environment, contemporary researchers should realize that no study is outside the public forum and to therefore consider shifting the paradigm to take personal responsibility in the process of accurately translating their scientific words into public policy actions to best serve as a source of clarity.","publish_time":"2017-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kieh, Mark D.; Cho, Elim M.; Myles, Ian A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12c3660c37af4a311a3a14667a12ce48388dd6ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5480889.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5480889/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["media reporting","public advising","media analysis","public misunderstanding","public trust","public forum","media outlets","academic literature","EVD outbreak","general review articles","public policy actions","public health emergencies","comprehensive review articles","accurate reporting","EVD information","study","source of clarity","lay press","demands of today\u2019s fast-paced media environment","context of outbreak conditions","press sources","outbreaks of influenza","expense of clarity","epidemic outbreaks","general viewing","traditional paradigm","non-government agencies","mixed-methods analysis","complementary role of extracting findings of high","model","CERC","confusion","contemporary researchers","Emergency Risk Communication","importance","scientific words","measles","adherence","smoking habits","direct causation","expected background knowledge","process","Crisis","technical accuracy","Ebola Virus Disease","need","academia","medication compliance","personal responsibility","behavior change","inferiority","uncertainties","erosion","barriers"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of plasma PENK in comparison with neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) in septic patients. METHODS: A total of 167 septic patients were enrolled: 99 with sepsis, 37 with septic shock, and 31 with suspected sepsis. PENK and NGAL concentrations were measured and GFR was estimated by using the isotope dilution mass spectrometry traceable-Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study and three Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations: CKD-EPI(Cr), CDK-EPI(CysC), and CKD-EPI(Cr-CysC). The PENK, NGAL, and eGFR results were compared according to sepsis severity, presence or absence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The PENK, NGAL, and eGFR results were significantly associated with sepsis severity and differed significantly between patients with and without AKI only in the sepsis group (all P\u003C0.05). PENK was superior to NGAL in predicting AKI (P=0.022) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) (P=0.0085). Regardless of the variable GFR category by the different eGFR equations, PENK showed constant and significant associations with all eGFR equations. Unlike NGAL, PENK was not influenced by inflammation and predicted the 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: PENK is a highly sensitive and objective biomarker of AKI and RRT and is useful for prognosis prediction in septic patients. With its diagnostic robustness and predictive power for survival, PENK constitutes a promising biomarker in critical care settings including sepsis.","publish_time":"2017-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hanah; Hur, Mina; Lee, Seungho; Marino, Rossella; Magrini, Laura; Cardelli, Patrizia; Struck, Joachim; Bergmann, Andreas; Hartmann, Oliver; Di Somma, Salvatore","journal":"Ann Lab Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/533f8d39de2e16fb92614d2441621e8fddd85bbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5500737.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5500737/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzYxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["AKI"],"organizations":["PENK","NGAL","GFR","Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration","CDK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eGFR results","sepsis severity","septic patients","CKD-EPI","NGAL concentrations","suspected sepsis","sepsis group","prognostic utility of plasma PENK","different eGFR equations","objective biomarker of AKI","CDK-EPI","predicting AKI","septic shock","Renal Disease","RRT","promising biomarker","kidney function","novel biomarker","Cr-CysC","Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration","absence of acute kidney injury","diagnostic robustness","renal replacement therapy","variable GFR category","neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin","comparison","Diet","Study","survival","isotope dilution mass spectrometry traceable-Modification","MDRD","presence","significant associations","critical care settings","glomerular filtration rates","predictive power","prognosis prediction","total","clinical outcomes","METHODS","inflammation","BACKGROUND","Proenkephalin","CONCLUSIONS","day mortality"],"language":"en"},

Although targeting radio-resistant cancer cells is important for improving the treatmental efficiency, the signaling pathway- and therapeutic strategy-related to laryngeal carcinoma still require further study. Galangin is an active pharmacological ingredient, isolated from propolis and Alpinia officinarum Hance, and has been reported to have anticancer and anti-oxidative properties through regulation of cell cycle, resulting in angiogenesis, apoptosis, invasion and migration without triggering any toxicity in normal cells. PI3K/AKT and p38 are important signaling pathways to modulate cancer cell apoptosis and proliferation through caspase-3, NF-\u03BAB and mTOR signal pathways. Autophagy is also enhanced by activating LC3s and Beclin 1. In the present study, galangin was found to suppress laryngeal cancer cell proliferation. Also, flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and western blot analysis indicated that cell apoptosis was induced for galangin administration, promoting caspase-3 expression through regulating PI3K/AKT/NF-\u03BAB. Furthermore, galangin inhibited laryngeal cancer cell proliferation, related to p38 inactivation by galangin treatment. Additionally, mTOR activation regulated by PI3K/AKT was reduced by galangin, suppressing cancer cell transcription and proliferation. Our data also indicated that the tumor volume and weight in nude mice were reduced for galangin use in vivo accompanied by Ki-67 decrease and TUNEL increase in tumor tissues. Together, our data indicated that galangin has a potential role in suppressing human laryngeal cancer via inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, activating apoptosis and autophagy, which were regulated by p38 and AKT/NF-\u03BAB/mTOR pathways, providing a therapeutic strategy for human laryngeal cancer treatment.","publish_time":"2017-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hai-Xu; Tang, Chen","journal":"Oncol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/073f69cb524332da71737facd889ffefd4aafa46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5562077.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5562077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Galangin"],"organizations":["Beclin","PI3K/AKT","AKT/NF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["laryngeal cancer cell proliferation","cancer cell apoptosis","cancer cell transcription","galangin treatment","galangin administration","inhibiting tumor cell proliferation","human laryngeal cancer treatment","AKT","Laryngeal cancers","laryngeal carcinoma","regulation of cell cycle","squamous cell carcinomas","mTOR pathways","NF-\u03BAB","radio-resistant cancer cells","mTOR signal pathways","therapeutic strategy","caspase","tumor volume","p38 inactivation","tumor tissues","regulating PI3K","mTOR activation","Autophagy","data","normal cells","present study","western blot analysis","propolis","anti-oxidative properties","potential role","immunohistochemical","migration","nude mice","expression","angiogenesis","flow cytometry","active pharmacological ingredient","toxicity","decrease","TUNEL","weight","invasion","treatmental efficiency","Alpinia officinarum Hance","Ki","LC3s","Beclin"],"language":"en"},

We retrieved 12 peptides based on the highest score for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertypes analysed by NetCTL. Initially, these peptides were assessed for the affinity with MHC class I and class II alleles, and four potential core epitopes VTARAGLGY, FHTVTVNTL, HTTWTLTGY, and IELAGTLTL were selected. From these, FHTVTVNTL and IELAGTLTL peptides were shown to have 100% conservancy. Finally, IELAGTLTL was shown to have the highest population coverage (83.86%) among the whole world population.

We engineered synthetic plasmid DNA to encode two novel and broadly cross-protective monoclonal antibodies targeting influenza A and B. We utilized enhanced in vivo delivery of these plasmid DNA-encoded monoclonal antibody (DMAb) constructs and show that this strategy induces robust levels of functional antibodies directed against influenza A and B viruses in mouse sera.

Furthermore, these two DMAbs can be delivered coordinately resulting in exceptionally broad protection against both influenza A and B.

In its early stages, symptoms of CKD are usually not apparent, especially those that are induced in a \u201Csilent\u201D manner in normotensive individuals, thereby providing a need for some kind of urinary biomarker to detect injury at an early stage. Because traditional renal biomarkers such as serum creatinine are insensitive, it is difficult to detect kidney injury induced by a high-salt diet, especially in normotensive individuals. Recently, several new biomarkers for damage of renal tubular epithelia such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) have been identified. Previously, we found a novel renal biomarker, urinary vanin-1, in several animal models with renal tubular injury. However, there are few studies about early biomarkers of the progression to CKD associated with a high-salt diet. This review presents some new insights about these novel biomarkers for CKD in normotensives and hypertensives under a high salt intake. Interestingly, our recent reports using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) fed a high-salt diet revealed that urinary vanin-1 and NGAL are earlier biomarkers of renal tubular damage in SHR and WKY, whereas urinary Kim-1 is only useful as a biomarker of salt-induced renal injury in SHR. Clinical studies will be needed to clarify these findings.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosohata, Keiko","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98451e334c51db917c85e62573eabd5bfaeac9e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5666762.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666762/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CKD","Wistar Kyoto","NGAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["renal injury","renal tubular injury","high-salt diet","biomarker of salt","High salt intake","traditional renal biomarkers","early biomarkers","novel renal biomarker","novel biomarkers","new biomarkers","earlier biomarkers of renal tubular damage","damage of renal tubular epithelia","kidney injury molecule","urinary vanin","urinary Kim","kind of urinary biomarker","symptoms of CKD","normotensive individuals","SHR","NGAL","WKY","early stages","normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats","chronic kidney disease","hypertensive rats","new insights","Clinical studies","neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin","hypertensives","normotensives","serum creatinine","development","need","progression","animal models","recent reports","manner","review","hypertension","findings"],"language":"en"},

Growing evidence suggests that this phenotype is recapitulated during chronic viral infection. The antigenic volume imposed by persistent and latent viruses exposes the immune system to unique challenges that lead to host T-cell exhaustion, characterized by impaired T-cell functions. These dysfunctional memory T cells lack telomerase, the protein capable of extending and stabilizing chromosome ends, imposing constraints on telomere dynamics. A deleterious consequence of this excessive telomere shortening is the premature induction of replicative senescence of viral-specific CD8\u002B memory T cells. While senescent cells are unable to expand, they can survive for extended periods of time and are more resistant to apoptotic signals. This review takes a closer look at T-cell exhaustion in chronic viruses known to cause human disease: Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B/C/D virus (HBV/HCV/HDV), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus-1/2 (HSV-1/2), and Varicella\u2013Zoster virus (VZV). Current literature linking T-cell exhaustion with critical telomere lengths and immune senescence are discussed. The concept that enduring antigen stimulation leads to T-cell exhaustion that favors telomere attrition and a cell fate marked by enhanced T-cell senescence appears to be a common endpoint to chronic viral infections.","publish_time":"2017-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bellon, Marcia; Nicot, Christophe","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63b21e59e43206a09eaa36fdc5233f22af7515e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5691640.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5691640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human T-cell leukemia virus","host T-cell exhaustion","enhanced T-cell senescence","impaired T-cell functions","cell fate","shortened telomeres of T cells","human immunodeficiency virus","D virus","Barr virus","Zoster virus","dysfunctional memory T cells lack telomerase","human disease","human papillomavirus","human herpesvirus","herpes simplex virus","telomere attrition","telomere dynamics","immune senescence","chronic viruses","senescent cells","chronic viral infections","excessive telomere shortening","critical telomere lengths","premature induction of replicative senescence of viral","latent viruses","immune system","progressive loss of immunological memory","aging correlates","reduced proliferative capacity","protein capable","stabilizing chromosome ends","specific CD8","Hepatitis B","imposing constraints","EBV","HCV","HIV","unique challenges","common endpoint","HBV","phenotype","HDV","HPV","Epstein","HTLV","closer look","antigen stimulation","deleterious consequence","Varicella","HSV","HHV","Current literature","antigenic volume","extended periods of time","VZV","review","apoptotic signals","Growing evidence","concept"],"language":"en"},

Biochemistry identified a mild hyperproteinaemia. Blood extraction and PCR detected Leishmania species, Hepatozoon species and \u2018Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\u2019 (CMhm) DNA. Subsequent sequencing identified Hepatozoon felis. Additionally, the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 1 locus of Leishmania infantum was partially sequenced and phylogeny showed it to cluster with species derived from dogs in Italy and Uzbekistan, and a human in France. Allopurinol treatment was administered for 6 months. Clinical signs resolved in the second month of treatment with no deterioration 8 months post-treatment cessation. Quantitative PCR and ELISA were used to monitor L infantum blood DNA and antibody levels. The cat had high L infantum DNA levels pretreatment that gradually declined during treatment but increased 8 months post-treatment cessation. Similarly, ELISA revealed high levels of antibodies pretreatment, which gradually declined during treatment and increased slightly 8 months post-treatment cessation. The cat remained PCR positive for CMhm and Hepatozoon species throughout the study. There was no clinical evidence of relapse 24 months post-treatment. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report of a cat with leishmaniosis with H felis and CMhm coinfections. The high L infantum DNA levels post-treatment cessation might indicate that although the lesions had resolved, prolonged or an alternative treatment could have been considered.","publish_time":"2017-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Attipa, Charalampos; Neofytou, Kyriaki; Yiapanis, Christos; Mart\u00EDnez-Orellana, Pamela; Baneth, Gad; Nachum-Biala, Yaarit; Brooks-Brownlie, Harriet; Solano-Gallego, Laia; Tasker, S\u00E9verine","journal":"JFMS Open Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ae7bedff3dfbfc1ccaeb5b662bbace00ae16b33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5692141.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5692141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","Quantitative PCR"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["months post-treatment cessation","month of treatment","alternative treatment","Allopurinol treatment","infantum DNA levels post-treatment cessation","Hepatozoon species","infantum DNA levels pretreatment","infantum blood DNA","amastigotes of Leishmania species","locus of Leishmania infantum","antibody levels","high levels of antibodies pretreatment","Hepatozoon felis","CMhm coinfections","PCR positive","lesions","Quantitative PCR","ELISA","clinical report","Clinical signs","clinical evidence of relapse","year-old female neutered domestic shorthair cat","H felis","Blood extraction","Cyprus","leishmaniosis","intracytoplasmic organisms","granulomatous dermatitis","Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum","deterioration","rRNA internal transcribed spacer","phylogeny","Uzbekistan","multiple ulcerated skin nodules","histopathology","Italy","dogs","cluster","NOVEL INFORMATION","human","knowledge","Subsequent sequencing","study","CASE SUMMARY","Biochemistry","mild hyperproteinaemia","RELEVANCE","France","Cytology"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: We invited a random sample from the national immunisation register of 1500 parents for an internet survey which was completed by 491 parents (33% response). The intention to vaccinate was highest for meningococcal B disease (83% positive intention), followed by rotavirus gastroenteritis (38%), and lowest for varicella (28%) and seasonal influenza (15%). Prediction analyses were performed to determine which out of seven questionnaire statements was most informative in predicting the intention to vaccinate. Main drivers of intention were the perceived importance of vaccination against the particular disease and the perception of whether or not the disease is severe enough to justify vaccination.

We demonstrated evidence of selection for distinct compositions of synonymous codons in early and late viral genes related to the adaptation of translation efficiency to different bacteriophage developmental stages. Specifically, we showed that evolution of viral coding regions is driven, among others, by selection for codons with higher decoding rates; during the initial/progressive stages of infection the decoding rates in early/late genes were found to be superior to those in late/early genes, respectively. Moreover, we argued that selection for translation efficiency could be partially explained by adaptation to Escherichia coli tRNA pool and the fact that it can change during the bacteriophage life cycle.

To address this knowledge gap, we utilized a prime-boost immunization approach to induce robust memory CD8 T cell responses in the absence of RSV-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies. Unexpectedly, RSV infection of mice with pre-existing CD8 T cell memory led to exacerbated weight loss, pulmonary disease, and lethal immunopathology. The exacerbated disease in immunized mice was not epitope-dependent and occurred despite a significant reduction in RSV viral titers. In addition, the lethal immunopathology was unique to the context of an RSV infection as mice were protected from a normally lethal challenge with a recombinant influenza virus expressing an RSV epitope. Memory CD8 T cells rapidly produced IFN-\u03B3 following RSV infection resulting in elevated protein levels in the lung and periphery. Neutralization of IFN-\u03B3 in the respiratory tract reduced morbidity and prevented mortality.

Next, we analyzed the cellular microRNA (miRNA)-modulated protein expression of porcine IFN-\u03B2 by dual firefly/Renilla luciferase reporter assay, transfection of miRNA mimics and inhibitor assay and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) treatment of PAMs, showing that porcine miRNAs including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 are able to inhibit IFN-\u03B2 protein expression in primary PAMs by directly targeting sequences within the porcine IFN-\u03B2 3\u2032UTR locating at 160\u2013181, 9\u201331, 27\u201347 and 12\u201332 bp, respectively.

The proteasome is essential for poxvirus replication, making the viral components interacting with the ubiquitin-proteasome system attractive antiviral targets. We show that proteasome inhibition impairs CPXV replication by prevention of uncoating, suggesting that uncoating is mediated by proteasomal degradation of viral core proteins. Although Orthopoxvirus particles contain considerable amounts of ubiquitin, distinct modification sites are largely unknown. Therefore, for the first time, we analyzed globally ubiquitination sites in CPXV mature virion proteins using LC-MS/MS. Identification of 137 conserved sites in 54 viral proteins among five CPXV strains revealed extensive ubiquitination of structural core proteins. Moreover, since virions contained primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin, we hypothesized that core proteins are modified accordingly. However, quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated CPXV proteins early in infection showed no proteasomal degradation of core proteins. Instead, our data indicate that the recently suggested proteasomal regulation of the uncoating factor E5 is a prerequisite for uncoating. Expanding our understanding of poxvirus uncoating and elucidating a multitude of novel ubiquitination sites in poxvirus proteins, the present study verifies the major biological significance of ubiquitin in poxvirus infection.","publish_time":"2018-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grossegesse, Marica; Doellinger, Joerg; Fritsch, Annemarie; Laue, Michael; Piesker, Janett; Schaade, Lars; Nitsche, Andreas","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/703744c49c4908516297844dee0ba03affc36a74.json; document_parses/pdf_json/48c0614e47f4de8d1d1f1edbf9c9663cd014926d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5788924.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788924/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPXV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["poxvirus proteins","viral proteins","proteasomal degradation of core proteins","proteasomal degradation of viral core proteins","CPXV mature virion proteins","CPXV replication","extensive ubiquitination of structural core proteins","understanding of poxvirus uncoating","quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated CPXV proteins","CPXV strains","poxvirus replication","poxvirus infection","prevention of uncoating","conserved sites","uncoating factor E5","multitude of novel ubiquitination sites","distinct modification sites","viral components","proteasome inhibition","considerable amounts of ubiquitin","ubiquitin-proteasome system attractive antiviral targets","suggested proteasomal regulation","major biological significance of ubiquitin","Cowpox virus","emergence of Variola virus","present study","natural evolution of zoonotic Orthopoxviruses","LC-MS","Orthopoxvirus particles","Identification","K48-linked polyubiquitin","prerequisite","virions","global health threat","data","time"],"language":"en"},

However, behaviors with/without risk perception on the control of influenza transmission among age groups have not been well quantified. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess to what extent, under scenarios of with/without control and preventive/protective behaviors, the age-specific network-driven risk perception influences influenza infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A behavior-influenza model was used to estimate the spread rate of age-specific risk perception in response to an influenza outbreak. A network-based information model was used to assess the effect of network-driven risk perception information transmission on influenza infection. A probabilistic risk model was used to assess the infection risk effect of risk perception with a health behavior change. RESULTS: The age-specific overlapping percentage was estimated to be 40%\u201343%, 55%\u201360%, and 19%\u201335% for child, teenage and adult, and elderly age groups, respectively. Individuals perceive the preventive behavior to improve risk perception information transmission among teenage and adult and elderly age groups, but not in the child age group. The population with perceived health behaviors could not effectively decrease the percentage of infection risk in the child age group, whereas for the elderly age group, the percentage of decrease in infection risk was more significant, with a 97.5th percentile estimate of 97%.

However, vaccine-derived herd immunity may be short-lived due to interactions between human mobility and imperfect or waning vaccine efficacy. As the supply and utilization of oral cholera vaccines grows, critical questions related to herd immunity are emerging, including: who should be targeted; when should revaccination be performed; and why have cholera outbreaks occurred in recently vaccinated populations? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use mathematical models to simulate routine and mass oral cholera vaccination in populations with varying degrees of migration, transmission intensity, and vaccine coverage. We show that migration and waning vaccine efficacy strongly influence the duration of herd immunity while birth and death rates have relatively minimal impacts. As compared to either periodic mass vaccination or routine vaccination alone, a community could be protected longer by a blended \u201CMass and Maintain\u201D strategy. We show that vaccination may be best targeted at populations with intermediate degrees of mobility as compared to communities with very high or very low population turnover. Using a case study of an internally displaced person camp in South Sudan which underwent high-coverage mass vaccination in 2014 and 2015, we show that waning vaccine direct effects and high population turnover rendered the camp over 80% susceptible at the time of the cholera outbreak beginning in October 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Oral cholera vaccines can be powerful tools for quickly protecting a population for a period of time that depends critically on vaccine coverage, vaccine efficacy over time, and the rate of population turnover through human mobility. Due to waning herd immunity, epidemics in vaccinated communities are possible but become less likely through complementary interventions or data-driven revaccination strategies.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peak, Corey M.; Reilly, Amanda L.; Azman, Andrew S.; Buckee, Caroline O.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/552ee0cc0a8266b6c22dbc287bd080513a3374fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5847240.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5847240/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Sudan"],"keyphrases":["mass oral cholera vaccination","vaccine coverage","waning vaccine efficacy","cholera outbreaks","routine vaccination","high-coverage mass vaccination","waning herd immunity","vaccine-derived herd immunity","periodic mass vaccination","utilization of oral cholera vaccines","high population turnover","waning vaccine direct effects","duration of herd immunity","rate of population turnover","low population turnover","human mobility","vaccinated populations","intermediate degrees of mobility","vaccinated communities","period of time","varying degrees of migration","at-risk settings","endemic settings","displaced person camp","data-driven revaccination strategies","South Sudan","complementary interventions","death rates","birth","transmission intensity","epidemics","approach","critical questions","mathematical models","interactions","powerful tools","supply","minimal impacts","case study","FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","strategy","community"],"language":"en"},

Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (isolated from two different donors) and primary epithelial cells (harvested from 27 patients undergoing airway surgery) were experimentally infected with H7N9 and/or H1N1pdm for 72 h. After virus infection, the culture media were collected for viral RNA quantitation and cytokine detection. Both H7N9 and H1N1pdm viruses replicated and induced a cytokine response differently for each donor in the normal human bronchial epithelial model. H7N9 replicated equivalently in epithelial cells harvested from the inferior turbinate and paranasal sinus, and those from the larynx and bronchus, at 72 h post-infection. Viral RNA quantity at 72 h was significantly higher in patients aged 21\u201364 years than in patients aged \u2265 65 years; however, no effects of sex, medical comorbidities, and obesity were noted. H7N9-infected cultured cells released multiple cytokines within 72 h.

In host cells, some transmembrane serine proteases such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT, along with plasmin in the bloodstream, have been reported to cleave the HA precursor (HA(0)) molecule into its active forms, HA(1) and HA(2). Some trypsinogens can also enhance IAV proliferation in some cell types (e.g., rat cardiomyoblasts). However, the precise activation mechanism for this process is unclear, because the expression level of the physiological activator of the trypsinogens, the TMPRSS15 enterokinase, is expected to be very low in such cells, with the exception of duodenal cells. Here, we show that at least two variant enterokinases are expressed in various human cell lines, including A549 lung-derived cells. The exogenous expression of these enterokinases was able to enhance the proliferation of IAV in 293T human kidney cells, but the proliferation was reduced by knocking down the endogenous enterokinase in A549 cells. The enterokinase was able to enhance HA processing in the cells, which activated trypsinogen in vitro and in the IAV-infected cells also. Therefore, we conclude that enterokinase plays a role in IAV infection and proliferation by activating trypsinogen to process viral HA in human cell lines.","publish_time":"2018-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayashi, Hideki; Kubo, Yoshinao; Izumida, Mai; Takahashi, Etsuhisa; Kido, Hiroshi; Sato, Ko; Yamaya, Mutsuo; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Nakayama, Kou; Matsuyama, Toshifumi","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7edf3278c1d0e8577856f24bb6c3eac949201e60.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5876233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["A549 cells","IAV-infected cells","IAV proliferation","proliferation of IAV","host cells","viral HA","HA processing","HA precursor","IAV infection","exception of duodenal cells","T human kidney cells","A549 lung-derived cells","TMPRSS15 enterokinase","endogenous enterokinase","various human cell lines","cell types","trypsinogens","expression level","exogenous expression","activation of hemagglutinin","successful infection","variant enterokinases","transmembrane serine proteases","precise activation mechanism","TMPRSS4","TMPRSS2","essential prerequisites","virus","physiological activator","influenza","molecule","role","plasmin","HAT","rat cardiomyoblasts","active forms","Cleavage","bloodstream"],"language":"en"},

Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging. To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co- and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). METHODS: Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co- and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested. Sera were fractionated, randomly applied to protein chip arrays (IMAC, CM10 and H50) and spectra were generated at low and high laser intensities. RESULTS: Sixteen biomarkers achieved a p value \u003C 0.01 (ROC values \u003E 0.75 or \u003C 0.25) predictive of fibrosis status in co-infected individuals and 14 in mono infected subjects. Five of these candidate biomarkers contributed to both mono- and co-infected subjects. Candidate diagnostic algorithms were created to distinguish between non-fibrotic and fibrotic individuals using a panel of 4 biomarker peaks. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that SELDI MS profiling can identify diagnostic serum biomarkers for fibrosis that are both common and distinct in HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected individuals.","publish_time":"2018-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Golizeh, Makan; Melendez-Pena, Carlos E.; Ward, Brian J.; Saeed, Sahar; Santamaria, Cynthia; Conway, Brian; Cooper, Curtis; Klein, Marina B.; Ndao, Momar","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a01f5cf1c5cdc2711bcef74315dc54a6e143df0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5880398.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5880398/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":["HIV/HCV co","SELDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV co-infected","HCV mono-infected individuals","HCV mono-infected subjects","co-infected individuals","HCV mono-infected patients","co-infected subjects","mono infected subjects","staging HCV","HIV","liver fibrosis staging","different stages of fibrosis","fibrotic individuals","predictive of fibrosis status","candidate biomarkers","diagnostic serum biomarkers","liver biopsy","liver disease","Sera","SELDI MS profiling","SELDI-TOF MS","Candidate diagnostic algorithms","serious complications","non-invasive methods","Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus","serum proteome profiles","human immunodeficiency virus","high laser intensities","surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time","flight mass spectrometry","CM10","gold standard","IMAC","panel","search","cirrhosis","p value","protein chip arrays","spectra","H50","BACKGROUND","data","test","sampling errors","ROC values","end","biomarker peaks","challenges","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Delayed phase nadir platelet counts demonstrated a high and significantly negative linear correlation with B cell percentages and serum IL 6 levels. We also presented bone marrow aspiration pathology of three patients with delayed phase thrombocytopenia, showing impaired maturation of megakaryocytes.

Forty-four S2P-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated, three of which bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The antibodies were minimally mutated from germline and were derived from different B cell lineages. Only two antibodies displayed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. The most potent antibody bound the RBD in a manner that prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Our study indicates that the majority of antibodies against the viral envelope spike that were generated during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection are non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive maturation.

Moreover, Galidesivir also inhibits the reproduction of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and numerous other medically important flaviviruses. Until now, studies of this antiviral agent have not yielded resistant viruses. Here, we demonstrate that an E460D substitution, in the active site of TBEV RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), confers resistance to Galidesivir in cell culture. Stochastic molecular simulations indicate that the steric freedom caused by the E460D substitution increases close electrostatic interactions between the inhibitor and the interrogation residue of the TBEV RdRp motif F, resulting in rejection of the analogue as an incorrect/modified nucleotide. Galidesivir-resistant TBEV exhibited no cross-resistance to structurally different antiviral nucleoside analogues, such as 7-deaza-2\u2019-C-methyladenosine, 2\u2019-C-methyladenosine and 4\u2019-azido-aracytidine. Although, the E460D substitution led only to a subtle decrease in viral fitness in cell culture, Galidesivir-resistant TBEV was highly attenuated in vivo, with 100% survival rate and no clinical signs observed in infected mice. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular basis of Galidesivir antiviral activity, flavivirus resistance to nucleoside inhibitors and the potential contribution of viral RdRp to flavivirus neurovirulence. Importance Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a pathogen that causes severe human neuroinfections in large areas of Europe and Asia and for which there is currently no specific therapy. We have previously found that Galidesivir (BCX4430), a broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor, which is under clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus infection, has a strong antiviral effect against TBEV. For any antiviral drug, it is important to generate drug-resistant mutants to understand how the drug works. Here, we produced TBEV mutants resistant to Galidesivir and found that the resistance is caused by a single amino acid substitution in an active site of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme which is crucial for replication of viral RNA genome. Although, this substitution led only to a subtle decrease in viral fitness in cell culture, Galidesivir-resistant TBEV was highly attenuated in a mouse model. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular basis of Galidesivir antiviral activity.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eyer, Ludek; Nougair\u00E8de, Antoine; Uhl\u00ED\u0159ov\u00E1, Marie; Driouich, Jean-S\u00E9lim; Zouharov\u00E1, Darina; Vald\u00E9s, James J.; Haviernik, Jan; Gould, Ernest A.; De Clercq, Erik; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Ruzek, Daniel","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ae0e227f20960cc18b33946a7c92969dfac79a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/563544","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBEV"],"locations":["Europe","Asia"],"keyphrases":["Galidesivir-resistant TBEV","TBEV mutants resistant","viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","molecular basis of Galidesivir antiviral activity","broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor","RNA-polymerase","antiviral drug","active site of TBEV RNA-dependent","adenosine analogue Galidesivir","E460D substitution","drug-resistant mutants","viral fitness","replication of viral RNA genome","TBEV RdRp motif F","antiviral agent","resistant viruses","clinical development","cell culture","treatment of Ebola virus infection","reproduction of tick-borne encephalitis virus","Importance Tick-borne encephalitis virus","strong antiviral effect","potential contribution of viral RdRp","clinical safety","clinical signs","flavivirus resistance","different antiviral nucleoside analogues","subtle decrease","BCX4430","single amino acid substitution","drug works","C-methyladenosine","results","Stochastic molecular simulations","nucleoside inhibitors","flavivirus neurovirulence","important flaviviruses","cross-resistance","healthy subjects","pharmacokinetics study","Phase","interrogation residue","large areas of Europe","severe human neuroinfections","steric freedom","close electrostatic interactions","rejection","enzyme","pathogen","survival rate","Asia","modified nucleotide","infected mice","mouse model","deaza","studies","azido-aracytidine","specific therapy"],"language":"en"},

To predict the impact of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions identified in ORF3a on the formation of B-cell epitopes and their role in evading the immune response, nucleotide and protein sequences of 537 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions. Mutations were correlated with changes in epitope formation. A total of 19 different non-synonymous amino acids substitutions were detected in ORF3a among 537 SARS-CoV-2 strains. G251V was the most common and identified in 9.9% (n=53) of the strains and was predicted to lead to the loss of a B-cell like epitope in ORF3a. Polyproline regions were detected in two strains (EPI_ISL_410486, France and EPI_ISL_407079, Finland) and affected epitopes formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations and detected polyproline regions in ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 could be driving the evasion of the host immune response thus favoring viral spread.

These tools were developed to support renal services in the South of England (the Wessex region caring for 650 patients), but are applicable elsewhere. Methods A discrete-event simulation was used to model a worst case spread of COVID-19 (80% infected over three months), to stress-test plans for dialysis provision throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the ability of the system to manage the mix of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, and examined the likely effects on patients, outpatient workloads across all units, and inpatient workload at the centralised COVID-positive inpatient unit. A second Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model estimated the feasibility of patient transport plans and relaxing the current policy of single COVID-19 patient transport to allow up to four infected patients at a time. Results If current outpatient capacity is maintained there is sufficient capacity in the South of England to keep COVID-19 negative/recovered and positive patients in separate sessions, but rapid reallocation of patients may be needed (as sessions are cleared of negative/recovered patients to enable that session to be dedicated to positive patients). Outpatient COVID-19 cases will spillover to a secondary site while other sites will experience a reduction in workload. The primary site chosen to manage infected patients will experience a significant increase in outpatients and in-patients. At the peak of infection, it is predicted there will be up to 140 COVID-19 positive patients with 40 to 90 of these as inpatients, likely breaching current inpatient capacity (and possibly leading to a need for temporary movement of dialysis equipment). Patient transport services will also come under considerable pressure. If patient transport operates on a policy of one positive patient at a time, and two-way transport is needed, a likely scenario estimates 80 ambulance drive time hours per day (not including fixed drop-off and ambulance cleaning times). Relaxing policies on individual patient transport to 2-4 patients per trip can save 40-60% of drive time. In mixed urban/rural geographies steps may need to be taken to temporarily accommodate renal COVID-19 positive patients closer to treatment facilities. Conclusions Discrete-event simulation simulation and Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model provides a useful method for stress-testing inpatient and outpatient clinical systems prior to peak COVID-19 workloads.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Allen, M.; Bhanji, A.; Willemsen, J.; Dudfield, S.; Logan, S.; Monks, T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/384fc454bbb744da290b5360b37ce5861a985a63.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20075457v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South"],"keyphrases":["Outpatient COVID","negative patients","infected patients","positive patients closer","renal COVID","peak COVID","mix of COVID","Patient transport services","centralised COVID-positive inpatient unit","rapid reallocation of patients","individual patient transport","current policy of single COVID","feasibility of patient transport plans","two-way transport","current inpatient capacity","current outpatient capacity","outpatient workloads","inpatient workload","dialysis services","Conclusions Discrete-event simulation simulation","renal services","stress-testing inpatient","simulation modelling tools","ambulance drive time hours","Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model","outpatient clinical systems","dialysis provision","South of England","likely effects","sufficient capacity","need","stress-test plans","likely scenario estimates","temporary movement of dialysis equipment","separate sessions","secondary site","primary site","peak of infection","Relaxing policies","ambulance cleaning times","useful method","day","fixed drop-off","organisation of networks","significant increase","cases","spillover","units","rural geographies steps","sites","Wessex region","treatment facilities","outpatients","in-patients","study","Methods","Results","inpatients","considerable pressure","worst case","reduction","months","outbreak","pandemic","ability","trip"],"language":"en"},

While basic surgical facemasks are more commonly available, their efficacy is limited due primarily to their poor face seal. This pilot study examined the impact of a rubber band mask brace on a basic surgical mask, as determined by quantitative fit testing. Methods: Subjects wearing a basic surgical facemask and the rubber band mask brace underwent quantitative fit testing using machinery designed to certify N95 mask fit. Subjects were tested with the brace anchored behind their eyes, with a paperclip behind the head, and on the side knobs of their face shields. The primary outcome measure was whether the subject passed the quantitative fit test at or above the OSHA verified standard for N95 masks. Results: Subjects (n=11) were 54.5% female, with a median height of 70 inches (IQR 68-74), weight of 170 lbs (IQR 145-215) and BMI of 24.6 (IQR 22.2-27.2), and encompassing 5 distinct N95 mask fit types. We found that 45%, 100% and 100% of subjects passed the quantitative fit test when the brace was anchored behind the ears, with a paperclip and on a face shield respectively. Conclusion: Of the 11 subjects included in the analysis, across a range of body habitus and N95 mask fit types, all passed the quantitative fit test when the mask brace was anchored on either face shield or with a paperclip. This data suggests the brace would offer an improved margin of safety when worn with a basic surgical mask.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Runde, D.

Lung ultrasound has been proposed to diagnose and it. However, little is known about ultrasound findings in these patients. Our aim is to present an overview of lung ultrasound characteristics in critically ill patients with SARS CoV2 pneumonia overall and in relation to the duration of symptoms and clinical parameters. Methods: On the Intensive Care Unit of two academic hospitals, adult patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 were included. Images were analyzed for pleural line characteristics, number and appearance of B-lines, BLUE-profiles (Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency), pathology in the PLAPS (Postero Lateral Alveolar and Pleural Syndrome) point and a LUS-score (lung ultrasound). The primary outcomes were frequencies, percentages and differences in lung ultrasound findings overall and between short ([\u2264]14 days) and long (\u003E14 days) duration of symptoms and their correlation with clinical parameters. Results: In this pilot observational study, 61 patients were included with 75 examinations for analysis. The most prevalent ultrasound findings were decreased lung sliding (36%), thickening of the pleural line (42%) and a C-profile per view (37%). Patients with \u0027\u0027long\u0027\u0027 duration of symptoms presented more frequently with a thickened and irregular pleural line (21% (32) vs 9% (11), p=.01), C-profile per patient (47% (18) vs. 25% (8),p=.01) and pleural effusion (19% (14) vs 5% (3),p=.02) compared to patients with short duration of symptoms.

This is especially crucial for applicants without a home program in their specialty of interest, as away rotations are an important opportunity to confirm interest in pursuit of a subspecialty, obtain letters of recommendation, and make positive impressions at programs of interest. The objective of this article is to assess the current COVID-19 pandemic situation in light of away rotations and to provide recommendations for surgical subspecialty programs and applicants in order to have the best outcome during this upcoming application cycle. In particular, we emphasize the importance of implementing universal processes within each individual subspecialty.

Using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus as a model system, STAR technology detected single copies of the viral genome in a two-gene multiplex. Blinded studies using RNA extracted from various tissues of a SARS-infected individual showed that STAR correctly identified all samples containing SARS virus and yielded negative results for non-SARS control samples.

Face-to-face healthcare, including psychiatric provision, must continue despite reduced interpersonal contact during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) pandemic. Community-based services might use domiciliary visits, consultations in healthcare settings, or remote consultations. Services might also alter direct contact between clinicians. Aims. We examined the effects of appointment types and clinician-clinician encounters upon infection rates. Methods. We modelled a COVID-19-like disease in a hypothetical community healthcare team, their patients, and patients\u0027 household contacts (family). In one condition, clinicians met patients and briefly met family (e.g. home visit or collateral history). In another, patients attended alone (e.g. clinic visit), segregated from each other. In another, face-to-face contact was eliminated (e.g. videoconferencing). We also varied clinician-clinician contact; baseline and ongoing \u0022external\u0022 infection rates; whether overt symptoms reduced transmission risk behaviourally (e.g. via personal protective equipment, PPE); and household clustering. Results. Service organization had minimal effects on whole-population infection under our assumptions but materially affected clinician infection. Appointment type and inter-clinician contact had greater effects at low external infection rates and without a behavioural symptom response. Clustering magnified the effect of appointment type. We discuss infection control and other factors affecting appointment choice and team organization. Conclusions. Distancing between clinicians can have significant effects on team infection. Loss of clinicians to infection likely has an adverse impact on care, not modelled here. Appointments must account for clinical necessity as well as infection control. Interventions to reduce transmission risk can synergize, arguing for maximal distancing and behavioural measures (e.g. PPE) consistent with safe care.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cardinal, R.

Conventional testing for SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in universal transport medium (UTM), extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). As testing has scaled across the world, supply chain challenges have emerged across this entire workflow. Here we sought to evaluate how eliminating the UTM storage and RNA extraction steps would impact the results of molecular testing. Using paired mid-turbinate swabs self-collected by 11 individuals with previously established SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we performed a comparison of conventional (swab \u2192 UTM \u2192 RNA extraction \u2192 RT-qPCR) vs. simplified (direct elution from dry swab \u2192 RT-qPCR) protocols. Our results suggest that dry swabs eluted directly into a simple buffered solution (TE) can support molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 via endpoint RT-qPCR without substantially compromising sensitivity.

SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is a golden standard for defining the recovery of COVID-19 infections. To dissect the underlying diseases that could impact on viral clearance, we enrolled 106 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China between Jan 5 and Feb 25, 2020. Methodology: We comprehensively analyzed demographic, clinical and laboratory data, as well as patient treatment records. Survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modelling were employed to identify factors influencing the viral clearance negatively. Results: We found that increasing age, male gender, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) associated factors (including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases) adversely affected the viral clearance. Furthermore, analysis by a random forest survival model pointed out hypertension, cortisone treatment, gender, and age as the four most important variables.

Methods Kidneys from two genetic models of kidney ACE ablation and mice treated with captopril or telmisartan were used to examine ACE2 in isolated kidney and lung membranes. Results In a global ACE KO mice, ACE2 protein abundance in kidney membranes was reduced to 42 % of wild type, p \u003C 0.05. In ACE 8/8 mice that over-expresses cardiac ACE protein but also has no kidney ACE expression, ACE2 protein in kidney membranes was also decreased (38 % of the WT, p\u003C0.01). In kidney membranes from mice that received captopril or telmisartan for 2 weeks there was a reduction in ACE2 protein (37% in captopril treated p\u003C0.01) and 76% in telmisartan treated p \u003C0.05). In lung membranes the expression of ACE2 was very low and not detected by western blotting but no significant differences in terms of ACE2 activity could be detected in mice treated with captopril (118% of control) or telmisartan (93% of control). Conclusions Genetic kidney ACE protein deficiency, suppressed enzymatic activity by Captopril or blockade of the AT1 receptor with telmisartan are all associated with a decrease in ACE2 in kidney membranes. ACE2 protein in kidney or lungs is decreased or unaffected by RAS blockers indicating that these medications can not pose a risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection related to amplification of ACE2 at these two target sites for viral entry.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wysocki, Jan; Lores, Enrique; Ye, Minghao; Soler, Maria Jose; Batlle, Daniel","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ebe4b4e66e7b0b3fc60d7fa6306323c467f88dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.106658","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACE","RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["kidney membranes","kidney ACE expression","expression of ACE2","ACE2 protein abundance","amplification of ACE2","isolated kidney","captopril","telmisartan","Conclusions Genetic kidney ACE protein deficiency","terms of ACE2 activity","ACE inhibitors","genetic models of kidney ACE ablation","lung membranes","global ACE KO mice","over-expresses cardiac ACE protein","receptor blockers","main receptor","AT1 receptor","SARs-CoV","control","enzymatic activity","RAS blockers","significant differences","blockade","increase","lungs","western blotting","target sites","infection","Results","Ang","weeks","decrease","Methods Kidneys","viral entry","medications","risk","reduction","wild type","WT","Background"],"language":"en"},

Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R0 is derived. When R0 \u003C 1, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R0 \u003E 1, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, C.; Yu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Lu, Z.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d174c675d8fbd6a5407aacb3b18cec1353a5cca5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20078493v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIQRP","SEIQRPD"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["modified SEIQRP model","improved model","SEIQRPD model","trend of COVID","epidemic trend","United States","disease-free equilibrium point","generalized fractional-order SEIR model","endemic equilibrium points","weeks","basic reproduction number R0","development process of COVID","possible outbreak of infectious diseases","insect diseases","better prediction ability","basic guiding significance","local asymptotic stability of disease-free","government mitigation measurement","individual behavior","paper","spread","influence","real data","peak of isolated cases","Abstract","future","important reference","qualitative properties","conditions"],"language":"en"},

We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic control only works in cities with higher GDP per capita and population size, while fails in cities with lower GDP per capita and population size. In cities with lower population size, social distancing becomes inoperative; the rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects. The findings above verify the effectiveness and correctness of the measures implemented in China at present, at the same time, we propose that it is necessary to fully consider the respective characteristics of the two measures, cooperating and complementing each other; what\u0027s more, measures should be formulated according to the city\u0027s own situation, achieving precise epidemic prevention; Finally, we should increase the transparency of information, improve protection awareness of the public, guide emotions of the public in a proper way, enhancing public confidence.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, S.; Huang, J.; He, Z.; Zhan, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53b037bc3483125f095c2ce8cde0040f57c55d64.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.28.20046110v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dirk Brockmann","Dirk Helbing"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["traffic control measures","social distancing measures","precise epidemic prevention","Various epidemic prevention","better epidemic prevention effect","impact mechanism of traffic control","social costs","effectiveness of prevention","cities","public confidence","lower population size","higher protection awareness","higher GDP","lower GDP","China","accurate transmission of information","present stage","Dirk Brockmann","Dirk Helbing","transparency of information","person contact","accurate evaluation","stronger confidence of residents","combined action","model","guide emotions","proper way","certain cost","realization","situation","correctness","spread","econometric approach","good role","development","city\u0027s","respective characteristics","measure effects","findings","paper","time"],"language":"en"},

Syria protracted conflict has strained its health systems and caused fragmentation. In this study, we focus on northwest (NW) Syria, where recent violence has driven almost one million civilians (of the 4.17 million in the area) from their homes between December 2019 and March 2020. The area is challenged by overcrowding, inadequate WASH, shelter and insufficient healthcare services. Internationally promoted measures (social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine, lockdown) are not impossible. We model outcomes, according to three scenarios, should there be a COVD-19 outbreak. We aim to: 1. Predict the numbers of cases, including severe and critical ones, and deaths. 2. Identify critical time points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed due to COVID-19. Methodology: using the WHO COVD-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool (COVID-ESFT) and data from the Health Information System Unit on population and health facility capacity and utilization in northwest Syria, we generate predicted numbers of cases, deaths and health care needs according to three scenarios. Scenario One assumes a medium doubling rate (every 4 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Scenario Two assumes a fast doubling rate (every 3.2 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Camp-population Scenario assumes a very fast doubling rate (every 2.3 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Scenarios One and Two apply to the total population of 4.17 million and for 8 weeks from the first case while Camp-population Scenario applies only to the 1.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps and tented settlements and for 6 weeks from the first case. For each scenario, we identify critical time-points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed assuming a highly conservative estimate that 50% of regular hospital (ward) and ICU beds can be occupied by COVID-19 patients. Results: Scenario One predicts 16,384 cases (0.4% of the total population), of which 2,458 are severe and 819 are critical, and 978 deaths in the first 8 weeks. Scenario Two predicts 185,364 cases (4.4% of the population), of which 27805 are severe and 9268 are critical, and 11,066 deaths in the first 8 weeks. Camp-population Scenario predicts 240,000 cases (20% of the IDP population) of which 36,000 are severe and 12,000 are critical and 14,328 deaths in the first 6 weeks. With only 2,429 inpatient beds and 240 ICU beds (98 with adult ventilators, 62 with paediatric ventilators) in northwest Syria, ward and ICU bed capacities will be overwhelmed within 4-7 weeks. The Camp-population Scenario will see the earliest critical time-points. Conclusion and recommendations: Should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in NW Syria, projected cases and deaths will be particularly severe among IDPs. Health system capacity will be overwhelmed within a short period after the first case in camp settings. There is need for further research to account for additional variables that can impact projections. However, it is urgent for international community to mobilize efforts and resources to support community-based measures, increase testing, strengthen health system capacity.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hariri, M.; Rihawi, H.; Safadi, S.; McGlasson, M.

In response, many diagnostic manufacturers have developed molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway. This study compared three of these assays: the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fusion), the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (Aptima) and the BioFire Diagnostics COVID-19 test (BioFire), to determine analytical and clinical performance, as well as workflow. All three assays showed a similar limit of detection (LOD) using inactivated virus, with 100% detection ranging from 500-1,000 genome equivalents/ml, whereas use of a quantified RNA transcript standard showed the same trend, but had values ranging from 62.5 to 125 copies/ml, confirming variability in absolute quantification of reference standards. The clinical correlation found that the Fusion and BioFire assays had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.7%, followed by the Aptima assay at 94.7% when compared to the consensus result. All three assays exhibited 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). Analysis of discordant results revealed that all four samples missed by the Aptima assay had Ct values \u003E37 on the Fusion assay. In conclusion, while all three assays showed similar relative LODs, we showed differences in absolute LODs depending on which standard was employed. In addition, the Fusion and BioFire assays showed better clinical performance, while the Aptima assay showed a modest decrease in overall PPA. These findings should be kept in mind when making platform testing decisions.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Elizabeth; Zhen, Wei; Manji, Ryhana; Schron, Deborah; Duong, Scott; Berry, Gregory J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea3a6005c7d285432c3d5103ada9453d9aa75331.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.097311","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Food and Drug Administration","FDA","BioFire Diagnostics","LOD","RNA","PPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BioFire assays","Fusion assay","Aptima assay","molecular assays","Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV","Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV","BioFire Diagnostics COVID","better clinical performance","absolute LODs","clinical correlation","positive percent agreement","negative percent agreement","similar limit of detection","similar relative LODs","Ct values","overall PPA","Emergency Use Authorization","quantified RNA transcript standard","absolute quantification of reference standards","FDA","Drug Administration","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","variability","EUA","differences","modest decrease","diagnostic manufacturers","mind","pathway","Food","inactivated virus","trend","samples","platform testing decisions","NPA","addition","Analysis of discordant results","genome equivalents","response","copies","workflow","worldwide pandemic","consensus result","findings","study","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Aiming to understand a host genetic component of COVID-19, we focused on variants in genes encoding proteases and genes involved in innate immunity that could be important for susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes in 143 unrelated individuals from Serbian population identified 22 variants with potential functional effect. In silico analyses (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutPred2 and Swiss-Pdb Viewer) predicted that 10 variants could impact the structure and/or function of proteins. These protein-altering variants (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val in PLG; p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1; p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2; p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1) may have predictive value for inter-individual differences in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we performed comparative population analysis for the same variants using extracted data from the 1000 genomes project. Population genetic variability was assessed using delta MAF and Fst statistics. Our study pointed to 7 variants in PLG, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes with noticeable divergence in allelic frequencies between populations worldwide. Three of them, all in MBL2 gene, were predicted to be damaging, making them the most promising population-specific markers related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comparing allelic frequencies between Serbian and other populations, we found that the highest level of genetic divergence related to selected loci was observed with African, followed by East Asian, Central and South American and South Asian populations. When compared with European populations, the highest divergence was observed with Italian population. In conclusion, we identified 4 variants in genes encoding proteases (FURIN, PLG and PRSS1) and 6 in genes involved in the innate immunity (MBL2 and OAS1) that might be relevant for the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klaassen, Kristel; Stankovic, Biljana; Zukic, Branka; Kotur, Nikola; Gasic, Vladimir; Pavlovic, Sonja; Stojiljkovic, Maja","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bd6bdfae9757ae1e18cceefc4be91b8eed0eef6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.093690","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["variants","OAS1 genes","PLG","infection","Serbian population","New coronavirus SARS-CoV","Population genetic variability","MBL2 gene","Italian population","South Asian populations","comparative population analysis","highest divergence","European populations","highest level of genetic divergence","noticeable divergence","TMPRSS11a","proteases","allelic frequencies","innate immunity","promising population-specific markers","host response","host genetic component of COVID","Analysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN","extracted data","novel disease COVID","Arg261His","Asn54Lys","unrelated individuals","Arg52Cys","Ile99Val","Ala494Val","Gly54Asp","Arg47Gln","Gly57Glu","predictive value","delta MAF","inter-individual differences","susceptibility","Arg130His","Gly146Ser","selected loci","MutPred2","humans","potential functional effect","resistance","Swiss-Pdb Viewer","PolyPhen","Fst statistics","genomes project","structure","silico analyses","function of proteins","study","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively.

However, not all workers are employed in occupations which can be done from home. These workers are at an increased risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2due to increased interaction with the public and other workers, and also potentially at an increased risk for job displacement as more extreme public health measures (such as closing of retail operations or enforcing shelter in place) occur. Methods To characterize the occupations least likely to be able to work from home, national employment and wage data maintained by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with measures from the BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations by a variety of physical, ergonomic, psychosocial, and structural exposures. Noting that the work that could most easily be done at home would be work done on a computer that does not rely on interaction with the public, O*NET measures quantifying the importance of computer use at work, and the importance of working with or performing for the public at work were utilized. Results From this analysis, 19.5% (28.2 M) of the United States workforce covered by O*NET are employed in occupations where working from home would be difficult, due to minimal use of computer at work, and a high level of interaction with the public. These workers tend to be in service occupations, including retail and food service, protective service occupations, and transportation occupations such as bus drivers. About 25% (35.6 M) of the United States workforce covered by O*NET are employed in occupations where working from home could likely be more easily accommodated, as these workers do much of their work on computers and interaction with the public is not important. These workers tend to be in technology, computer, management, administrative, financial, engineering, and some science occupations, which typically have higher pay than occupations which cannot be done at home. Conclusions The workers in occupations that have minimal computer use, and high interaction with the public are least likely to be able to work from home during a public health emergency. These workers could also be at an increased risk for job displacement if public-facing establishments close or alter their business model in the face of increased public health restrictions. Occupations where working from home is not possible tend to have lower annual median incomes than occupations where working from home is possible, increasing the vulnerability of these workers. Characterizing which occupational groups are least likely to be able to work from home can inform public health risk management and prioritize occupational sectors where additional workplace protections are necessary.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baker, M.

Since COVID-19 testing is now available, some have raised the question of whether we should be routinely testing asymptomatic healthcare workers. Methods: Using publicly available data on COVID-19 infections and emergency department visits, as well as internal hospital staffing information, we generated a mathematical model to predict the impact of periodic COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic members of the emergency department staff in regions affected by COVID-19 infection. We calculated various transmission constants based on the Diamond Princess cruise ship data, used a logistic model to calculate new infections, and we created a Markov model according to average COVID-19 incubation time. Results: Our model predicts that after 30 days, with a transmission constant of 1.219e-4 new infections per person2, weekly COVID-19 testing of healthcare workers (HCW) would reduce new HCW and patient infections by 5.1% and bi-weekly testing would reduce both by 2.3%. At a transmission constant of 3.660e-4 new infections per person,2 weekly testing would reduce infections by 21.1% and bi-weekly testing would reduce infections by 9.7-9.8%. For a lower transmission constant of 4.067e-5 new infections per person2, weekly and biweekly HCW testing would result in a 1.54% and 0.7% reduction in infections respectively. Conclusion: Periodic COVID-19 testing for emergency department staff in regions that are heavily-affected by COVID-19 and/or facing resource constraints may reduce COVID-19 transmission significantly among healthcare workers and previously-uninfected patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Y.; Cheng, S.-R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d73c09993df1a488ed2de81e9287896e5647a9d1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20084053v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","Diamond Princess","HCW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weekly COVID","new infections","average COVID","number of COVID","testing of healthcare workers","bi-weekly testing","patient infections","impact of periodic COVID","biweekly HCW testing","new HCW","asymptomatic healthcare workers","lower transmission constant","emergency department staff","logistic model","mathematical model","Markov model","emergency department visits","various transmission constants","person2","regions","available data","asymptomatic members","Diamond Princess cruise ship data","PPE","shortages","personal protective equipment","internal hospital staffing information","hospitals","cases","incubation time","uninfected patients","days","Conclusion","resource constraints","Methods","Background","question","Results","reduction"],"language":"en"},

Cases are clustered in the city, with certain neighborhoods experiencing more cases than others. We investigate whether potential socioeconomic factors can explain between-neighborhood variation in the number of detected COVID-19 cases. Methods: Data were collected from 177 Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) in New York City (99.9% of the population). We fit multiple Bayesian Besag-York-Molli\u00E9 (BYM) mixed models using positive COVID-19 tests as the outcome and a set of 10 representative economic, demographic, and health-care associated ZCTA-level parameters as potential predictors. The BYM model includes both spatial and nonspatial random effects to account for clustering and overdispersion. Results: Multiple different regression approaches indicated a consistent, statistically significant association between detected COVID-19 cases and dependent (under 18 or 65\u002B years old) population, male to female ratio, and median household income. In the final model, we found that an increase of only 1% in dependent population is associated with a 2.5% increase in detected COVID-19 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6% to 3.4%, p \u003C 0.0005). An increase of 1 male per 100 females is associated with a 1.0% (95% CI: 0.6% to 1.5%, p \u003C 0.0005) increases in detected cases. A decrease of $10,000 median household income is associated with a 2.5% (95% CI: 1.0% to 4.1% p = 0.002) increase in detected COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our findings indicate associations between neighborhoods with a large dependent population, those with a high proportion of males, and low-income neighborhoods and detected COVID-19 cases. Given the elevated mortality in aging populations, the study highlights the importance of public health management during and after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Further work is warranted to fully understand the mechanisms by which these factors may have affected the number of detected cases, either in terms of the true number of cases or access to testing.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whittle, Richard Stuart; Diaz-Artiles, Ana","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccc4c0864819efd39f01daf534f7246eb7a6479b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20069823v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BYM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of detected cases","number of detected COVID","true number of cases","positive COVID","current COVID","increase","New York City","large dependent population","low-income neighborhoods","certain neighborhoods","BYM model","median household income","pandemic","multiple Bayesian Besag-York","potential socioeconomic factors","health-care","potential predictors","final model","ZCTA-level parameters","Multiple different regression approaches","importance of public health management","Molli\u00E9","nonspatial random effects","female ratio","account","study","mixed models","Zip Code Tabulation Areas","major urban center","set","clustering","demographic","tests","associations","high proportion of males","neighborhood variation","significant association","terms","aging populations","Results","outcome","Abstract Background","access","elevated mortality","years old","Data","overdispersion","findings","decrease","confidence interval","testing","Conclusions","females","USA","Methods","mechanisms","work"],"language":"en"},

Based on information obtained from Italian surgeons in Milan and given concerns regarding rising case numbers in Washington state, we implemented new vascular surgery guidelines, which canceled all non-emergent surgical procedures and involved significant changes to our inpatient and outpatient workflow. The consequences of these decisions are not yet understood. Methods The division of vascular surgery at Harborview Medical Center immediately instituted new vascular surgery COVID-19 practice guidelines on March 17, 2020. Subsequent clinic, operative, and consult volume was collected over the next 4 weeks and compared to historical averages. Washington state case/death numbers and UW Medicine hospital case volumes were collected from publicly available sources. Results Since March 10, 2020, the number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases within the UW Medicine system has increased 1867%, with floor and intensive care unit bed utilization increasing by 120% and 215%, respectively. After instituting our new COVID-19 guidelines, our average weekly clinical volume decreased by 96.5% (43.1 patients to 1.5 per week), our average weekly surgical volume decreased by 71.7% (from 15 cases to 4.25 per week), and our inpatient consultation volume decreased to 1.81 consults per day. 60% of consultations were completed as telemedicine \u201Ce-consults\u201D in which the patient was never evaluated in-person. Trainee surgical volume has also decreased by 86.4% for the vascular surgery fellow and 84.8% for the integrated resident. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has changed every aspect of \u201Cnormal\u201D vascular surgical practice in a large academic institution. New practice guidelines effectively reduced operating room utilization and decreased staff and trainee exposure to potential infection, with changes to clinic volume not resulting in an immediate rise in emergency department/inpatient consultations or acute surgical emergencies. These changes, although preserving resources, are also reducing trainee exposure and operative volume significantly, which requires new modes of education delivery. Lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, if analyzed, will help us prepare for the next crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hemingway, Jake F.; Singh, Niten; Starnes, Benjamin W.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0741521420310983; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521420310983?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Harborview Medical Center","UW Medicine"],"locations":["Milan","Washington"],"keyphrases":["new COVID","new vascular surgery COVID","Trainee surgical volume","new vascular surgery guidelines","clinic volume","operative volume","vascular surgical practice","New practice guidelines","average weekly surgical volume","positive COVID","inpatient consultation volume","division of vascular surgery","vascular surgery fellow","Washington state case","average weekly clinical volume","decreased staff","pandemic","inpatient consultations","trainee exposure","acute surgical emergencies","rising case numbers","significant changes","non-emergent surgical procedures","new modes of education delivery","cases","UW Medicine hospital case volumes","UW Medicine system","death numbers","e-consults","Subsequent clinic","positive test","operating room utilization","intensive care unit bed utilization","Harborview Medical Center","concerns","potential infection","emergency department","Milan","immediate rise","floor","large academic institution","Italian surgeons","aspect","frontlines","outpatient workflow","information","telemedicine","Methods","resources","available sources","Abstract Objective","weeks","historical averages","day","Conclusions","integrated resident","consequences","decisions","person","Results","patients","Lessons","crisis"],"language":"en"},

Mounting evidence suggests that TRIM25\u2019s E3 ligase activity is regulated by RNAs. However, while mutations affecting RNA-binding have been described, the precise RNA binding site has not been identified nor which domains are involved. Here, we present biophysical evidence for the presence of RNA binding sites on both TRIM25 PRY/SPRY and coiled-coil domains, and map the binding site on the PRY/SPRY with residue resolution.

A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P \u003C 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P \u003C 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P \u003E 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039]. Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially nFLNs, and GP under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19. Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat VT in medical staff and GP are extremely necessary.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zhenyu; Ge, Jingwu; Yang, Meiling; Feng, Jianping; Qiao, Mei; Jiang, Riyue; Bi, Jiangjiang; Zhan, Gaofeng; Xu, Xiaolin; Wang, Long; Zhou, Qin; Zhou, Chenliang; Pan, Yinbing; Liu, Shijiang; Zhang, Haiwei; Yang, Jianjun; Zhu, Bin; Hu, Yimin; Hashimoto, Kenji; Jia, Yan; Wang, Haofei; Wang, Rong; Liu, Cunming; Yang, Chun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14783283da3482bf2aab4e6100fe4ea5c29d8db7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029322","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VT scores","GP","lower scores","median","control of COVID","nFLNs","IQR","front-line nurses","periods of aiding COVID","large number of medical staff","Psychological stress","psychological responses","psychological problems","study","statistical difference","increased attention","Wuhan city","total","Hubei province","mobile app-based questionnaire","infection","Corona Virus Disease","general public","vicarious traumatization","situation","spread","interquartile range","gender","addition","odds ratio","factors","confidence interval","concern","Results","Early strategies","people","pandemic","fertility"],"language":"en"},

Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated their relative energies, correlated these energies to COVID-19 infection data, and analysed structural interactions. We predict that known mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but not fish, birds or reptiles.

Abstract Pneumonia caused by coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, has been spread around the world already becoming a pandemic. Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds. In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hern\u00E1ndez, A.; Papadakos, P.

While this has resulted in some some success in slowing down the spread of the virus, lock-downs as well as widespread quarantine have devastating effects on the economy and social life. Thus, governments are urgently looking for efficient strategies to significantly relax lock-downs, while still controlling the spread of the virus. We argue that this can be done by using active feedback to control testing for infection by actively testing individuals with a high probability of being infected. We develop an active testing strategy to achieve this goal, and demonstrate that it would have tremendous success in controlling the spread of the virus on one million people, using 3; 000 tests per day.

Since late December 2019, humans have been under threat due to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19; previously known as 2019-nCoV), since its first reported cases in Wuhan, China [1]. Consequently, the virus infection has been declared a pandemic. While the World is finding expedited approvals for the development of vaccine, which is time dependent, being preventative and not possibly a cure, physicians and countries\u2019 leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that this age-old antimalarial drug, CQ/HCQ could be a potent therapeutic agent against COVID-19 infection. Based on accumulating scientific reports, we have highlighted in this review, the different possible modes of action of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine that could particularly justify its use against viral infections. Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the option of using the drugs and repurposing of old drugs in this instance, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, specifically, hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 could be the best choice. CQ/HCQ has diverse modes of action, like alteration of acidic environment inside lysosome, late endosomes, restriction further with endocytosis, exsosome release, phagolysosomal fusion in systematically and subsequently inhibition of cytokine storm in host cell. One or sum of diverse mechanisms might work against the viral infections and help prevent more deaths. Given that there is no cure for COVID-19, the clinical testing of HCQ is urgently needed to ascertain its potency against the virus as this is the current available treatment option.

We further observe that isolation sources (e.g., oronasopharynx, saliva, feces, etc.) could not be predicted by the n-mer patterns in these sequences.

Utilizing mass cytometry (CyTOF) of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we identified effector memory CD4 T cells and CD4\u2212CD8low/-CD161\u002B T cells as the circulating immune subtypes with the greatest expression of p-NF-\u03BAB in response to IL-1\u03B2 stimulation. Notably, CCR6 distinctly identified T cells most responsive to IL-1\u03B2. Other subsets including CD11c myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), classical monocytes (CM), two subsets of natural killer cells (CD16\u2212CD56brightCD161\u2212 and CD16\u2212CD56dimCD161\u002B) and a population of lineage\u2212(Lin-) cells expressing CD161 and CD25 also showed IL-1\u03B2-induced expression of p-NF-kB.

Interindividual heterogeneity and inhibition of this activation by Anakinra raises the intriguing possibility that assays to measure IL-1\u03B2-induced p-NF-kB in CCR6\u002B T cell subtypes could identify those at higher risk of cytokine storm and those most likely to benefit from Anakinra therapy.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kothari, Hema; Williams, Corey M.; McSkimming, Chantel; Vigneshwar, Mythili; Zunder, Eli R.; McNamara, Coleen A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4343b0765f2fa0d6e5b3f8a42663684279095b7e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.047274","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B2-induced p-NF","inhibited IL","Prolonged IL","\u03B2-induced expression of p","\u03B2 stimulation","p-STAT5","T cell subsets","greatest expression of p","p-p38 expression","subsets of natural killer cells","effector memory CD4 T cells","T cell subtypes","\u03B2-induced production of downstream STAT","increased p-STAT3","CD11c myeloid dendritic cells","specific immune cell subsets","lesser extent p-STAT1","NF-\u03BAB","CCR6","CD25","human peripheral blood mononuclear cells","Anakinra therapy","CD11c mDCs","CD14 monocytes","circulating immune subtypes","classical monocytes","higher risk of cytokine storm","COVID","trending inhibition","R antagonist","CD8low","CyTOF","activation","CD56brightCD161","response","cytokines","mortality","high morbidity","robust increase","clinical trials","role","blockade","intriguing possibility","knowledge","key mediator","receptor","majority","mass cytometry","subjects","Interindividual heterogeneity","CD56dimCD161","population of lineage","pathways","humans"],"language":"en"},

However, clinicopathologic features diagnostic of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have not been reported. Pathologic studies to date have largely focused on the pulmonary finding of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). To this aim, we study the reticuloendothelial organs of four consecutive patients dying of COVID-19 and correlate with clinical and laboratory parameters to detect HLH. Methods: Autopsies restricted to chest and abdomen were performed on four patients who succumbed to COVID-19. Spleen, liver, and multiple pulmonary hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes were sampled in all cases. Bone marrow was obtained by rib squeeze in a subset of cases. Routine H\u0026E staining as well as immunohistochemical staining for CD163 was performed to detect hemophagocytosis. Clinical and laboratory results from pre-mortem blood samples were used to calculate H-scores. Findings: All four cases demonstrated DAD within the lungs. Three of the four cases had histologic evidence of hemophagocytosis within pulmonary hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes. One case showed hemophagocytosis in the spleen but none showed hemophagocytosis in liver or bone marrow. Lymphophagocytosis was the predominant form of hemophagocytosis observed. One patient showed diagnostic features of HLH with an H-score of 217 while a second patient was likely HLH with a partial H-score of 145 due to missing triglyceride level. Both patients exhibited high fever and early onset rise in serum ferritin; however, neither bicytopenia, pancytopenia, nor hypofibrinogenemia were observed in either. The remaining two patients had H-scores of 131 and 96. Interpretation: This is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 associated HLH.

Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups. Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, P\u003C0.001). The COVID-19 group had lower WBC [5.19\u00D710^9/L (\u00B11.47) versus 7.21\u00D710^9/L (\u00B12.94), P\u003C0.001] and neutrophil counts [3.39\u00D710^9/L (\u00B11.48) versus 5.38\u00D710^9/L (\u00B12.85), P\u003C0.001] in peripheral blood. However, the percentage and count of lymphocytes were not different. On lung CT scans, involvement of 4 or more lobes was more common in the COVID-19 group (45% versus 16.4%, P=0.008). Interpretation In the period of COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei Province, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting to our Fever Clinic in Beijing was 6.14%. Epidemiological evidence was important for prompt case finding, and lower blood WBC and neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiation from pneumonia of other etiologies.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Ying; Liang, Jingjin; Zhou, Qingtao; Li, Xiaoguang; Lin, Fei; Deng, Zhonghua; Zhang, Biying; Li, Lu; Wang, Xiaohua; Zhu, Hong; Ma, Qingbian; Tong, Xiaomei; Xu, Jie; Sun, Yongchang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0eee9760aee0ca2fdf8d1d215c3689d5f8d84df5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027763","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fever Clinics","CT","WBC"],"locations":["Peking University Third Hospital","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of COVID","period of COVID","non-COVID","spread of COVID","probable cases of COVID","clinical features of COVID","cases of pneumonia","pneumonia patients","suspected cases","Fever Clinics","epidemiological data","Epidemiological evidence","CT features","lung CT findings","lower WBC","Hubei Province","lower blood WBC","neutrophil counts","lung CT scans","study period","identified epidemiological history","etiologies","Beijing","retrospective study","peripheral blood","nCoV detection","symptoms","prompt case","areas","country","laboratory","challenge","medical staff","differentiation","Wuhan","respiratory infections","epidemic","single-center","panel discussion","involvement","Peking University","Hospital","count of lymphocytes","RT-PCR","lobes","pneumonias","percentage","Methods","Background","Interpretation","groups"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and also to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. Blood donors comprise approximately 4.7% of the similarly aged population of Denmark and blood is donated in all areas of the country. The objective of this study was to perform real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR. Methods: All Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to 17 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The first 9,496 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.7% (CI: 0.9-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100,000 (CI: 59-154) infections. Conclusions: The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR, including only individuals with no comorbidity, is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. This may have implications for risk mitigation. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Erikstrup, Christian; Hother, Christoffer Egeberg; Pedersen, Ole Birger Vestager; M\u00F8lbak, K\u00E5re; Skov, Robert Leo; Holm, Dorte Kinggaard; S\u00E6kmose, Susanne; Nilsson, Anna Christine; Brooks, Patrick Terrence; Boldsen, Jens Kjaergaard; Mikkelsen, Christina; Gybel-Brask, Mikkel; S\u00F8rensen, Erik; Dinh, Khoa Manh; Mikkelsen, Susan; M\u00F8ller, Bjarne Kuno; Haunstrup, Thure; Harritsh\u00F8j, Lene; Jensen, Bitten Aagaard; Hjalgrim, Henrik; Lillevang, S\u00F8ren Thue; Ullum, Henrik","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6ffc647a841257cc40d125408caca01651ee7ba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.20075291","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFR"],"locations":["Denmark"],"keyphrases":["seroprevalence of SARS","seroprevalence data","seroprevalence surveying of blood donations","Danish blood donors","combined IFR","previous SARS-CoV","real-time seroprevalence surveying","combined adjusted seroprevalence","areas","real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV","current estimate","population numbers","tool","aged population of Denmark","infections","epidemic","fold lower","test validation","available data","current societal interventions","commercial lateral flow test","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","uncertainties","G antibodies","fatalities","informed decisions","patients younger","account","comorbidity","specificity","assay sensitivity","immunoglobulin","study","infection fatality rate","authorities","tremendous consequences","individuals","Methods","countries","years","confidence intervals","risk mitigation","implications","societies","Background","Antibody status","Results","Knowledge","measures","objective","spread","country","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

We developed a methodology that corrects observed positive test rates for non-random sampling to estimate population infection rates across U.S. states from March 31 to April 7. Methods We adapted a sample selection model that corrects for non-random testing to estimate population infection rates. The methodology compares how the observed positive case rate vary with changes in the size of the tested population, and applies this gradient to infer total population infection rates. Model identification requires that variation in testing rates be uncorrelated with changes in underlying disease prevalence. To this end, we relied on data on day-to-day changes in completed tests across U.S. states for the period March 31 to April 7, which were primarily influenced by immediate supply-side constraints. We used this methodology to construct predicted infection rates across each state over the sample period. We also assessed the sensitivity of the results to controls for state-specific daily trends in infection rates. Results The median population infection rate over the period March 31 to April 7 was 0.9% (IQR 0.64 1.77). The three states with the highest prevalence over the sample period were New York (8.5%), New Jersey (7.6%), and Louisiana (6.7%). Estimates from models that control for state-specific daily trends in infection rates were virtually identical to the baseline findings. The estimates imply a nationwide average of 12 population infections per diagnosed case. We found a negative bivariate relationship (corr. = -0.51) between total per capita state testing and the ratio of population infections per diagnosed case. Interpretation The effectiveness of the public health response to the coronavirus pandemic will depend on timely information on infection rates across different regions. With increasingly available high frequency data on COVID-19 testing, our methodology could be used to estimate population infection rates for a range of countries and subnational districts. In the United States, we found widespread undiagnosed COVID-19 infection. Expansion of rapid diagnostic and serological testing will be critical in preventing recurrent unobserved community transmission and identifying the large numbers individuals who may have some level of viral immunity.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benatia, D.; Godefroy, R.; Lewis, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88f96d713095b8c1eb6cccd44734da9956f8374e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20072942v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S.","United States"],"keyphrases":["testing rates","total population infection rates","predicted infection rates","median population infection rate","state testing","tested population","positive test rates","non-random testing","ratio of population infections","methodology","serological testing","testing capabilities","sample period","state-specific daily trends","diagnosed case","United States","observed positive case rate","coronavirus disease","day-to-day changes","sample selection model","Estimates","results","Public health efforts","public health response","widespread undiagnosed COVID","underlying disease prevalence","non-random sampling","coronavirus pandemic","highest prevalence","Model identification","New York","New Jersey","large shares of mild","large numbers individuals","available high frequency data","timely information","recurrent unobserved community transmission","gradient","range of countries","variation","tests","nationwide average","different regions","Expansion of rapid diagnostic","asymptomatic cases","effectiveness","size","subnational districts","Interpretation","Background","Methods","limitations","models","level of viral immunity","baseline findings","immediate supply-side constraints","negative bivariate relationship","sensitivity","IQR","Louisiana"],"language":"en"},

Molecular biological techniques are permitting a rapid and accurate diagnosis of infections caused by respiratory pathogens, and have typically been applied to upper respiratory samples. Sputum induction provides an opportunity to directly sample secretions from the lower respiratory tract. Objectives/study design: To determine the role of induced sputum reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the detection of respiratory pathogens and compare this with detection using serology and immunofluorescent antigen (IFA) testing, we recruited 49 adults from emergency room with exacerbations of asthma. After a medical assessment and spirometry, sputum was induced using ultrasonically nebulised normal saline. Sputum was assayed using IFA and RT-PCR for flu and RSV. Flu serology was performed acutely and at convalescence, 4\u20135 weeks later. Results: Influenza A or B was detected in 24% of the samples by PCR, significantly more than the nine cases detected using serology and the one case using IFA (P\u003C0.05). RSV was detected in 37% of samples using PCR and 20% by IFA (P\u003C0.05). Conclusion: The combination of induced sputum and RT-PCR provides a useful means of detecting respiratory infection. The technique is safe in both adults and children, and RT-PCR is more sensitive than conventional serology and IFA. The improved sensitivity of induced sputum RT-PCR also permits a more rapid diagnosis and the opportunity of early administration of effective treatments.","publish_time":"2003-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simpson, Jodie L; Moric, Ivana; Wark, Peter A.B; Johnston, Sebastian L; Gibson, Peter G","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85d6ee282a18e659c53f5fc532668ee72e68b8ef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653202000847; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653202000847","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFA","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFA","improved sensitivity of induced sputum RT-PCR","detection of respiratory pathogens","respiratory infection","combination of induced sputum","upper respiratory samples","Sputum induction","Flu serology","lower respiratory tract infections","respiratory syncytial virus","RSV","conventional serology","role of induced sputum reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","rapid diagnosis","adults","Influenza","important viral pathogens","accurate diagnosis of infections","severe exacerbations of asthma","opportunity of early administration of effective treatments","immunofluorescent antigen","useful means","emergency room","testing","secretions","children","Molecular biological techniques","study design","medical assessment","spirometry","Abstract Background","Conclusion","nebulised normal saline","Objectives","Results","convalescence","weeks","cases"],"language":"en"},

Hence, early surveillance and public health emergency disposal are considered crucial to curb this emerging infectious disease. However, studies that investigated the early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China are relatively few. We aimed to compare the strengths and weaknesses of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for prevention and control between COVID-19 and H7N9 avian influenza, which was commended by the international community, in China. Methods: A case-comparison study was conducted using a set of six key time nodes to form a reference framework for evaluating early surveillance and public health emergency disposal between H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai, China and COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Findings: A report to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China, for the first hospitalized patient was sent after 6 and 20 days for H7N9 avian influenza and COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the pathogen was identified faster in the case of COVID-19 than in the case of H7N9 avian influenza (12 days vs. 31 days). The government response regarding COVID-19 was 10 days later than that regarding avian influenza. The entire process of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal lasted 5 days longer in COVID-19 than in H7N9 avian influenza (46 days vs. 41 days). Conclusions: The identification of the unknown pathogen improved in China between the outbreaks of avian influenza and COVID-19. The longer emergency disposal period in the case of COVID-19 could be attributed to the government\u0027s slower response to the epidemic. Improving public health emergency management could lessen the adverse social effects of emerging infectious diseases and public health crisis in the future.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Tiantian; Shi, Wenming; Wang, Ying; Bai, Ge; Dai, Ruiming; Wang, Qian; Luo, Li","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bdc5655187ad0c6bb1e7a1820c142985d8a690b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046490","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["case of COVID","public health emergency disposal","days","China","case of H7N9 avian influenza","public health emergency management","public health crisis","outbreaks of avian influenza","longer emergency disposal period","weaknesses of early surveillance","entire process of early surveillance","prevention","Disease Control","case-comparison study","novel coronavirus disease","unknown pathogen","government response","adverse social effects of emerging infectious diseases","government\u0027s slower response","reference framework","local Center","set","key time nodes","report","Shanghai","epidemic","identification","Background","Methods","strengths","future","Wuhan","Conclusions","Findings","international community","hospitalized patient","studies","contrast","world"],"language":"en"},

We tabulated the cases of physician deaths from COVID-19 associated with front-line work in hopes of mitigating future events. METHOD: On April 5, 2020, Google internet search was performed using the keywords doctor, physician, death, COVID, COVID-19, and coronavirus in English and Farsi, and in Chinese using the Baidu search engine. RESULTS: We found 198 physician deaths from COVID-19, but complete details were missing for 49 individuals. The average age of the physicians that died was 63.4 years (range 28 to 90 years) and the median age was 66 years of age. Ninety percent of the deceased physicians were male (175/194). General practitioners and emergency room doctors (78/192), respirologists (5/192), internal medicine specialists (11/192) and anesthesiologists (6/192) comprised 52% of those dying.

Potential therapies and means of prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulfate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulfate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. We performed a retrospective observational study to compare hospital outcomes among patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone. Methods: Data was collected from electronic medical records for all patients being treated with admission dates ranging from March 2, 2020 through April 5, 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. Patients in the study were excluded if they were treated with other investigational medications. Results: The addition of zinc sulfate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation, or ICU duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulfate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU, and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulfate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.09) reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice remained significant (OR 0.449, 95% CI 0.271-0.744).

Influenza is the disease caused by influenza viruses A and B; it could cause seasonal periodical epidemics and influenza A is implicated in worlwide pandemias. Influenza complications usually are limited to older patients and to those with comorbilities, especially those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. Anti-influenza therapy has an effect on the duration of the symptomatic period and vaccination efficiently decreases the incidence of the infection.

Methods A multi-center cross-section study (285 patients) and a single-center follow-up study (63 patients) were performed to investigate the feature of acute antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. A cohort of 52 COVID-19 suspects and 64 close contacts were enrolled to evaluate the potentiality of the antibody test. Results The positive rate for IgG reached 100% around 20 days after symptoms onset. The median day of serocon-version for both lgG and IgM was 13 days after symptoms onset. Seroconversion of IgM occurred at the same time, or earlier, or later than that of IgG. IgG levels in 100% patients (19/19) entered a platform within 6 days after seroconversion. The criteria of IgG seroconversion and \u2265 4-fold increase in the IgG titers in sequential samples together diagnosed 82.9% (34/41) of the patients. Antibody test aided to confirm 4 patients with COVID-19 from 52 suspects who failed to be confirmed by RT-PCR and 7 patients from 148 close contacts with negative RT-PCR. Conclusion IgM and IgG should be detected simultaneously at the early phase of infection. The serological diagnosis criterion of seroconversion or \u2265 4-fold increase in the IgG titer is suitable for a majority of COVID-19 patients.

Many of the solutions implemented now could consolidate in the near future, contributing to the definition of new digital-based models of care. The aim of this study is to describe which digital solutions have been reported in the early scientific literature to respond and fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. We conducted a rapid literature review searching PubMed and MedrXiv with terms considered adequate to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to COVID-19. Results. The search identified 52 articles, of which 38 full-text articles were assessed and 29 included in the review after screening. Of selected articles, most of them addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance and prevention. We report that digital solutions and innovative technologies have mainly been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In particular, within the reviewed articles we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial intelligence-powered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. Digital technologies are useful also for prevention and surveillance measures, for example through contact-tracing apps or monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. Discussion.

Then, we consider two possible alternatives: first, we keep the two parameters describing the interactions of older-older and older-young as they are now, but we increase the value of the parameter describing the interaction of young-young; this means that we allow the lockdown measures to be eased only in the young sub-population. Second, we increase the values of all the three above parameters, which means we ease the lockdown measures in both sub-populations.

Inclusion in the vaccine of highly conserved internal proteins such as the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix protein 1 (M1) was shown previously to increase vaccine efficacy by eliciting cross-reactive T-cells. However, appropriate delivery systems are required for efficient priming of T-cell responses. In this study, we demonstrated that administration of novel self-amplifying mRNA (SAM(\u00AE)) vectors expressing influenza NP (SAM(NP)), M1 (SAM(M1)), and NP and M1 (SAM(M1-NP)) delivered with lipid nanoparticles (LNP) induced robust polyfunctional CD4 T helper 1 cells, while NP-containing SAM also induced cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Robust expansions of central memory (T(CM)) and effector memory (T(EM)) CD4 and CD8 T cells were also measured. An enhanced recruitment of NP-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells was observed in the lungs of SAM(NP)-immunized mice after influenza infection that paralleled with reduced lung viral titers and pathology, and increased survival after homologous and heterosubtypic influenza challenge. Finally, we demonstrated for the first time that the co-administration of RNA (SAM(M1-NP)) and protein (monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine (MIIV)) was feasible, induced simultaneously NP-, M1- and HA-specific T cells and HA-specific neutralizing antibodies, and enhanced MIIV efficacy against a heterologous challenge. In conclusion, systemic administration of SAM vectors expressing conserved internal influenza antigens induced protective immune responses in mice, supporting the SAM(\u00AE) platform as another promising strategy for the development of broad-spectrum universal influenza vaccines.","publish_time":"2016-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magini, Diletta; Giovani, Cinzia; Mangiavacchi, Simona; Maccari, Silvia; Cecchi, Raffaella; Ulmer, Jeffrey B.; De Gregorio, Ennio; Geall, Andrew J.; Brazzoli, Michela; Bertholet, Sylvie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d26fb6227fcc98e9e8f9fecbedfd47bc4c00e7ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4985159.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4985159/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["SAM"],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza NP","M1-NP","HA-specific T cells","cross-reactive T-cells","lungs of SAM","specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells","enhanced recruitment of NP","influenza infection","systemic administration of SAM vectors","efficient priming of T","seasonal influenza vaccines","heterosubtypic influenza challenge","monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine","conserved internal influenza antigens","robust polyfunctional CD4 T helper","vaccine efficacy","HA-specific neutralizing antibodies","vaccine strain-specific neutralizing antibodies","development of broad-spectrum universal influenza vaccines","enhanced MIIV efficacy","conserved internal proteins","co-administration of RNA","cell responses","immunized mice","Robust expansions of central memory","matrix protein","heterologous challenge","effector memory","administration of novel self-amplifying mRNA","protective immune responses","pathology","increased survival","reduced lung viral titers","LNP","nucleoprotein","promising strategy","lipid nanoparticles","protection","conclusion","appropriate delivery systems","mismatched circulating viruses","time","platform","Current hemagglutinin","Inclusion","study"],"language":"en"},

Simulations of influenza spreading across real contact networks are in good accordance with real influenza records; however, epidemic simulations across idealized scale-free or small-world networks show considerable overestimation of disease prevalence, thus challenging the widely-applied idealized human contact models in epidemiology. Furthermore, the special contact pattern within Chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in Chinese colleges during the SARS period.

How porcine FcRn (pFcRn) expression is regulated by pathogenic infection remains unknown. Our research shows that IPEC-J2 cells infected with TGEV had up-regulated pFcRn expression. In addition, the NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway was activated in IPEC-J2 cells by TGEV infection. Furthermore, treatment of TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells with the NF-\u03BAB-specific inhibitor BAY 11-7082 resulted in down-regulation of pFcRn expression. Transient transfection of pFcRn promoter luciferase report plasmids with overexpression of NF-\u03BAB p65 transcription factor enhanced the activation of the luciferase report plasmids. We identified four NF-\u03BAB transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region of this gene using luciferase reporter system, chromatin immunoprecipitation, electromobility shift assay, and supershift analysis.

The potential impact of human respiratory coronavirus (CoV) infections was underestimated until the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, which showed that new, highly pathogenic coronaviruses could be introduced to humans, highlighting the importance of monitoring the circulating coronaviruses. The use of sensitive molecular methods has contributed to the differential diagnosis of viruses circulating in humans. Our study aim was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of human CoV strains circulating in Arkansas, their genetic variability and their association with reported influenza-like symptoms. We analyzed 200 nasal swab samples, collected by the Arkansas Department of Health in 2010, for influenza diagnosis. All samples were from patients showing acute respiratory symptoms while testing negative for influenza. Samples were pre-screened, using a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) multiprobe for coronavirus, and subjected to confirmatory pancoronavirus and/or strain-specific reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR followed by sequence analysis. Seventy-nine samples (39.5%) were positive by qRT-PCR and 35 samples (17.5%) were confirmed by conventional RT-PCR. Twenty-three of the confirmed samples (59%) were sequenced. The most frequent strain detected was HCoV-OC43-like followed by NL63-like; only one sample was positive for HCoV-229E and one for HCoV-HKU1. Feline-like CoV strains were detected in three samples, representing possible evidence of interspecies transmission or a new human strain. Seventeen percent of the coronavirus positive samples were also positive for other respiratory viruses, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza 2 and 3, and Rhinovirus. Thus, HCoV-OC43, NL63, HKU1 and new feline-like strains were circulating in Arkansas in 2010. HCoV was the sole respiratory virus detected in 16% of the patients who showed acute respiratory symptoms with negative diagnoses for influenza virus.","publish_time":"2014-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silva, Camila S; Mullis, Lisa B; Pereira, Olavo; Saif, Linda J; Vlasova, Anastasia; Zhang, Xuming; Owens, Randall J; Paulson, Dale; Taylor, Deborah; Haynes, Lia M; Azevedo, Marli P","journal":"Virol Mycol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/514a5ab6c1549c33d8acf502b929bc0699f5e21c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5004774.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5004774/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Arkansas Department of Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory symptoms","Acute respiratory viruses","coronavirus positive samples","confirmed samples","Respiratory Syncytial Virus","sole respiratory virus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","influenza virus","HCoV-OC43","HCoV-HKU1","nasal swab samples","potential impact of human respiratory coronavirus","qRT-PCR","new human strain","influenza diagnosis","circulating coronaviruses","molecular epidemiology of human CoV strains","SARS-CoV","reported influenza","new feline","conventional RT-PCR","strain-specific reverse transcriptase","frequent strain","differential diagnosis of viruses","NL63","patients","humans","Arkansas Department of Health","negative diagnoses","pathogenic coronaviruses","quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","use of sensitive molecular methods","infections","possible evidence of interspecies transmission","genetic variability","association","significant morbidity","Parainfluenza","RSV","multiprobe","confirmatory pancoronavirus","outbreak","importance","percent","study aim","sequence analysis","mortality","Rhinovirus"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the construction of a plasmid carrying a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-expressed prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV cDNA that can initiate infection following direct plasmid DNA transfection of mammalian cells. Incorporation of a synthetic intron in the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) region of the ZIKV polyprotein reduced viral cDNA-associated toxicity in bacteria. High levels of infectious virus were produced following transfection of the plasmid bearing the wild-type MR766 ZIKV genome, but not one with a disruption to the viral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) polymerase active site. Multicycle growth curve and plaque assay experiments indicated that the MR766 virus resulting from plasmid transfection exhibited growth characteristics that were more similar to its parental isolate than previously published 2010 Cambodia and 2015 Brazil cDNA-rescued ZIKV. This ZIKV infectious clone will be useful for investigating the genetic determinants of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis and should be amenable to construction of diverse infectious clones expressing reporter proteins and representing a range of ZIKV isolates. IMPORTANCE The study of ZIKV, which has become increasingly important with the recent association of this virus with microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome, would benefit from an efficient strategy to genetically manipulate the virus. This work describes a model system to produce infectious virus in cell culture. We created a plasmid carrying the prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV genome that both was stable in bacteria and could produce high levels of infectious virus in mammalian cells through direct delivery of this DNA. Furthermore, growth properties of this rescued virus closely resembled those of the viral isolate from which it was derived. This model system will provide a simple and effective means to study how ZIKV genetics impact viral replication and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2016-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwarz, Megan C.; Sourisseau, Marion; Espino, Michael M.; Gray, Essanna S.; Chambers, Matthew T.; Tortorella, Domenico; Evans, Matthew J.","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca73d739c9c8c6ddb081d0badcea76f821ae147a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5040786.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5040786/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzEzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cambodia","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["study of ZIKV","MR766 virus","ZIKV polyprotein","ZIKV infectious clone","Uganda MR766 ZIKV cDNA","rescued virus","Uganda MR766 ZIKV genome","range of ZIKV isolates","High levels of infectious virus","Brazil cDNA-rescued ZIKV","plasmid transfection","wild-type MR766 ZIKV genome","genetic determinants of ZIKV infection","recent Zika virus","ZIKV genetics impact viral replication","viral isolate","direct plasmid DNA transfection of mammalian cells","viral nonstructural protein","following transfection","construction of diverse infectious clones","viral cDNA-associated toxicity","prototype","growth characteristics","bacteria","growth properties","severe pathogenesis","model system","Multicycle growth curve","direct delivery","recent association","parental isolate","plaque assay experiments","microcephaly","NS5","reporter proteins","region","outbreak","effective means","Cambodia","promoter","NS1","polymerase active site","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","synthetic intron","cytomegalovirus","CMV","cell culture","disruption","efficient strategy","Incorporation","work","IMPORTANCE"],"language":"en"},

RVFV NSs protein, a nonstructural protein, is a major virulence factor that exhibits several important biological properties. These include suppression of general transcription, inhibition of IFN-\u03B2 promoter induction and degradation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R. Although each of these biological functions of NSs are considered important for countering the antiviral response in the host, the individual contributions of these functions towards RVFV virulence remains unclear. To examine this, we generated two RVFV MP-12 strain-derived mutant viruses. Each carried mutations in NSs that specifically targeted its general transcription inhibition function without affecting its ability to degrade PKR and inhibit IFN-\u03B2 promoter induction, through its interaction with Sin3-associated protein 30, a part of the repressor complex at the IFN-\u03B2 promoter. Using these mutant viruses, we have dissected the transcription inhibition function of NSs and examined its importance in RVFV virulence. Both NSs mutant viruses exhibited a differentially impaired ability to inhibit host transcription when compared with MP-12. It has been reported that NSs suppresses general transcription by interfering with the formation of the transcription factor IIH complex, through the degradation of the p62 subunit and sequestration of the p44 subunit. Our study results lead us to suggest that the ability of NSs to induce p62 degradation is the major contributor to its general transcription inhibition property, whereas its interaction with p44 may not play a significant role in this function. Importantly, RVFV MP-12-NSs mutant viruses with an impaired general transcription inhibition function showed a reduced cytotoxicity in cell culture and attenuated virulence in young mice, compared with its parental virus MP-12, highlighting the contribution of NSs-mediated general transcription inhibition towards RVFV virulence.","publish_time":"2016-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Terasaki, Kaori; Ramirez, Sydney I.; Makino, Shinji","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acf54b736dacc46a77d7f071f9c0cb9c14b2fc19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5053439.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5053439/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["R.

Given that respiratory diseases are the commonest causes of critical illness, use of aerosol therapy to provide high local drug concentrations with minimal systemic side effects makes this route an attractive option.

The health-protective behavioral response of the public plays an important role in limiting respiratory infectious disease spread. Health-protective behaviors take several forms. Behaviors can be categorized as pharmaceutical (e.g., vaccination uptake, antiviral use) or non-pharmaceutical (e.g., hand washing, face mask use, avoidance of public transport). Due to the limitations of pharmaceutical interventions during respiratory epidemics and pandemics, public health campaigns aimed at limiting disease spread often emphasize both non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical behavioral interventions. Understanding the determinants of the public\u2019s behavioral response is crucial for devising public health campaigns, providing information to parametrize mathematical models, and ultimately limiting disease spread. While other reviews have qualitatively analyzed the body of work on demographic determinants of health-protective behavior, this meta-analysis quantitatively combines the results from 85 publications to determine the global relationship between gender and health-protective behavioral response. The results show that women in the general population are about 50% more likely than men to adopt/practice non-pharmaceutical behaviors. Conversely, men in the general population are marginally (about 12%) more likely than women to adopt/practice pharmaceutical behaviors. It is possible that factors other than pharmaceutical/non-pharmaceutical status not included in this analysis act as moderators of this relationship. These results suggest an inherent difference in how men and women respond to epidemic and pandemic respiratory infectious diseases. This information can be used to target specific groups when developing non-pharmaceutical public health campaigns and to parameterize epidemic models incorporating demographic information.","publish_time":"2016-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moran, Kelly R.; Del Valle, Sara Y.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11ccc8d0c6d5b3297821a0e39535ce9dcb4810ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5074573.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5074573/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-pharmaceutical public health campaigns","non-pharmaceutical status","pharmaceutical behavioral interventions","practice pharmaceutical behaviors","practice non-pharmaceutical behaviors","Health-protective behaviors","health-protective behavioral response","limitations of pharmaceutical interventions","demographic determinants of health","respiratory infectious disease spread","Respiratory infectious disease epidemics","respiratory epidemics","women","results","public\u2019s behavioral response","demographic information","avoidance of public transport","pandemic respiratory infectious diseases","pandemics","epidemic models","general population","antiviral use","meta-analysis","analysis act","mathematical models","global relationship","face mask use","recurring events","hand washing","gender","important role","high cost","specific groups","vaccination uptake","body of work","inherent difference","factors","individuals","society","moderators","publications","forms","reviews"],"language":"en"},

This study investigates the in vitro and in vivo effects of P2X7R on Th17 cell differentiation during type II collagen (CII) induced experimental arthritis model. In CII-treated dendritic cells (DCs) and DC/CD4(\u002B) T coculture system, pretreatment with pharmacological antagonists of P2X7R (Suramin and A-438079) caused strong inhibition of production of Th17-promoting cytokines (IL-1\u03B2, TGF-\u03B21, IL-23p19 and IL-6). Exposure to CII induced the elevation of mRNAs encoding retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor \u03B1 and \u03B3t, which were abolished by pretreatment with P2X7R antagonists. Furthermore, blocking P2X7R signaling abolished the CII-mediated increase in IL-17A. Blockade of P2X7R remarkably inhibited hind paw swelling and ameliorated pathological changes in ankle joint of the collagen-induced arthritis mice. Thus, we demonstrated a novel function for P2X7R signaling in regulating CII-induced differentiation of Th17 cells.

We treat emergence as a dynamic bifurcation, and use the concept of bifurcation delay to understand the time to emergence after a system becomes supercritical.

We derive an analytic density function for the delay times and find it to be, in general, in agreement with stochastic simulations.

At inflammatory sites, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in excess by activated phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX2) can accentuate inflammatory responses. Thus, we investigated if Anv-water soluble polysaccharides could modulate primary human neutrophil oxidative burst in vitro. METHODS: Human neutrophils were isolated from fresh whole blood and O(2) (.-) generation was measured by cytochrome c reduction assays. Western blots were used to analyse the translocation of PKC, p47(phox) (a key component of NOX2 activity) to neutrophil plasma membrane. Also, myeloperoxidase (MPO) release in the extracellular medium was studied by western blots. Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect CD11b membrane expression. RESULTS: Water soluble polysaccharides from Anv dose-dependently inhibited N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF)- and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced O(2) (.-) generation by human neutrophils. Moreover, Anv-polysaccharides strongly inhibited PMA-induced PKC\u03B2 and p47(phox) translocation to membranes and p47(phox) phosphorylation on Ser328, a main PKC target. In contrast, polysaccharides extract from Zygophyllum gaetulum plant, which is also used as a traditional North African medicine against inflammatory diseases, was ineffective on this PKC\u03B2-p47phox pathway. Further, Anv inhibited important neutrophil degranulation markers corresponding to myeloperoxidase (MPO) release and CD11b membrane expression. CONCLUSION: The process of down-regulating NADPH oxidase by polysaccharides extracts from Anv provides new insights into the mechanism of Anv\u2019s anti-inflammatory actions.

DNA microarray analysis was also performed to clarify the mechanism underlying the antibacterial activity of GR-SU. We detected the antimicrobial activities of five agents against S. aureus strains. GRA and GR-SU showed strong antibacterial activities compared to the other three agents tested. At a higher concentration (above 2x MIC), GRA and GR-SU showed bactericidal activity, whereas at a concentration of 1x MIC, they showed a bacteriostatic effect. Additionally, GRA and GR-SU exhibited a synergistic effect with gentamicin. The expression of a large number of genes (including transporters) and metabolic factors (carbohydrates and amino acids) was altered by the addition of GR-SU, suggesting that the inhibition of these metabolic processes may influence the degree of the requirement for carbohydrates or amino acids. In fact, the requirement for carbohydrates or amino acids was increased in the presence of either GRA or GR-SU. GRA and GR-SU exhibited strong antibacterial activity against several S. aureus strains, including MRSA. This activity may be partly due to the inhibition of several pathways involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.","publish_time":"2016-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oyama, Kentaro; Kawada-Matsuo, Miki; Oogai, Yuichi; Hayashi, Tetsuya; Nakamura, Norifumi; Komatsuzawa, Hitoshi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a4a0f630530c7225fd23178fbdfedd2dccf535c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5098735.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5098735/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GRA","MRSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GR-SU","aureus strains","antibacterial activity of GR","addition of GR","bactericidal effects of GRA","amino acids","Staphylococcus aureus","carbohydrates","strong antibacterial activity","bactericidal activity","methicillin-resistant strains","strong antibacterial activities","amino acid metabolism","requirement","antimicrobial effect of glycyrrhetinic acid","synergistic effect","antimicrobial activities","bacteriostatic effect","inhibition","agents","stearyl glycyrrhetinate","metabolic factors","metabolic processes","higher concentration","disodium succinoyl glycyrrhetinate","dipotassium glycyrrhizate","transporters","MICs","serious problems","major pathogen","humans","glycyrrhetinyl stearate","derivatives","large number of genes","degree","pathways","presence","minimum inhibitory concentrations","expression","antibiotic resistance","gentamicin","mechanism","DNA microarray analysis","MRSA"],"language":"en"},

PTSD can damage functional capacity and interfere with social functioning. However, little is known about recovery from PTSD after floods. This study used 2013\u20132014 follow-up data on survivors of the 1998 Dongting Lake flood who were diagnosed with PTSD in 2000 to measure the prevalence rate of PTSD at follow-up and identify predictors of recovery from the PTSD diagnosis in 2000. METHODS: Participants included survivors who had been diagnosed as having PTSD in 2000 after the 1998 Dongting Lake flood. PTSD at follow-up was reassessed using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version. Information on demographics, trauma-related stressors, post-trauma stressors, social support, and coping style were collected through face-to-face interviews. The association between the independent variables and PTSD at follow-up was analyzed using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 201 participants with a PTSD diagnosis in 2000 were included in this study. A total of 19.4 % of the flood survivors with PTSD in 2000 continued to suffer from PTSD in 2013\u20132014. In the multivariable logistic regression model, individuals who had lost relatives (OR = 12.37, 95 % CI = 2.46\u201362.16), suffered from bodily injury (OR = 5.01, 95 % CI = 1.92\u201313.08), had a low level of social support (OR = 5.47, 95 % CI = 1.07\u201327.80), or had a negative coping style (OR = 4.92, 95 % CI = 1.89\u201312.81) were less likely to recover from PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of PTSD at follow-up indicates that natural disasters such as floods may have a negative influence on survivors\u2019 mental health for an extended period of time. Individuals who have lost relatives, suffered from bodily injury, had a low level of social support, or had a negative coping style were less likely to recover from PTSD. Therefore, effective psychological intervention measures are necessary for facilitating the recovery process from PTSD, especially for individuals with adverse prognostic factors.","publish_time":"2016-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dai, Wenjie; Wang, Jieru; Kaminga, Atipatsa C.; Chen, Long; Tan, Hongzhuan; Lai, Zhiwei; Deng, Jing; Liu, Aizhong","journal":"BMC Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/281ed09feadb379021bb0d63faa25b484ca482f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5101704.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5101704/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PTSD diagnosis","prevalence rate of PTSD","PTSD Checklist-Civilian version","follow-up data","negative coping style","individuals","flood survivors","Floods","low level of social support","social functioning","Dongting Lake flood","post-trauma stressors","negative influence","predictors of recovery","recovery process","Participants","relatives","bodily injury","total","study","trauma-related stressors","destructive natural disasters","logistic regression analyses","psychological disorders","multivariable logistic regression model","post-traumatic stress disorder","effective psychological intervention measures","survivors\u2019 mental health","extended period of time","physical injuries","world","demographics","functional capacity","independent variables","adverse prognostic factors","Information","face-to-face interviews","association","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

However, most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed non\u2013consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity. Based on the analysis of non\u2013consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen. The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections. Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% \u00B1 1.9% on average). Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% \u00B1 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.","publish_time":"2016-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Donghyun; Huh, Hee Jae; Kim, Yeon Jeong; Son, Dae-Soon; Jeon, Hyo-Jeong; Im, Eu-Hyun; Kim, Jong-Won; Lee, Nam Yong; Kang, Eun-Suk; Kang, Cheol In; Chung, Doo Ryeon; Ahn, Jin-Hyun; Peck, Kyong Ran; Choi, Sun Shim; Kim, Yae-Jean; Ki, Chang-Seok; Park, Woong-Yang","journal":"Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3e25d0cb02656c82dfac2860225f14588489066.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5111008.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5111008/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS","Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity","consensus sequences of MERS","investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity","outbreak of MERS","sequence heterogeneity","human MERS-CoVs","Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS","significant intrapatient variation","occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections","patient specimens","frequency of occurrence","CoV genomes","RBD","genetic variants","patients","D510G","I529T mutations","combined frequency","average","targeted deep sequencing","super-spreader specimen","Genome sequence analysis of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","human CD26","critical role","host immune response","relationship","highest level","receptor-binding domain","selection pressure","evolutionary dynamics","interaction","mechanisms of pathogenesis","single mutants","wild type","close association","cases","viral spike glycoprotein","hypothesis","affinity","South Korea","positions","total","studies"],"language":"en"},

Their vagility hinders data collection on abundance and distribution, which constrains modeling efforts and our understanding of bat ecology, viral dynamics, and spillover. We addressed this knowledge gap with models and data on the occurrence and abundance of nectarivorous fruit bat populations at 3 day roosts in southeast Queensland. We used environmental drivers of nectar production as predictors and explored relationships between bat abundance and virus spillover. Specifically, we developed several novel modeling tools motivated by complexities of fruit bat foraging ecology, including: (1) a dataset of spatial variables comprising Eucalypt\u2010focused vegetation indices, cumulative precipitation, and temperature anomaly; (2) an algorithm that associated bat population response with spatial covariates in a spatially and temporally relevant way given our current understanding of bat foraging behavior; and (3) a thorough statistical learning approach to finding optimal covariate combinations. We identified covariates that classify fruit bat occupancy at each of our three study roosts with 86\u201393% accuracy. Negative binomial models explained 43\u201353% of the variation in observed abundance across roosts. Our models suggest that spatiotemporal heterogeneity in Eucalypt\u2010based food resources could drive at least 50% of bat population behavior at the landscape scale. We found that 13 spillover events were observed within the foraging range of our study roosts, and they occurred during times when models predicted low population abundance. Our results suggest that, in southeast Queensland, spillover may not be driven by large aggregations of fruit bats attracted by nectar\u2010based resources, but rather by behavior of smaller resident subpopulations. Our models and data integrated remote sensing and statistical learning to make inferences on bat ecology and disease dynamics.

Here we performed a retrospective study to evaluate the performance of the T-SPOT.TB in patients with NTM diseases. METHODS: Between March, 2013 and Nov, 2015, a total of 58 patients with NTM diseases had a T-SPOT.TB performed were enrolled, 30 patients had definite NTM diseases, 28 had probable diseases. Their clinicopathological characteristics were reviewed and analyzed. Cultures for mycobacteria were performed. The indirect proportion method with L\u00F6wenstein\u2013Jensen (L-J) medium was used for first-line drug susceptibility test. T-SPOT.TB assay was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Data were expressed as mean \u00B1 standard deviation (continuous variables) and as numbers and percentages (categorical variables). The \u03C7 (2) test was used for comparisons between proportions. RESULTS: The average age was 51.8 \u00B1 16.1 years (range 10 to 77 years), 58.6% (34/58) were male. 16.4% (9/55) were TB-PCR positive. 34 (58.6%) isolates were Mycobacterium intracellulare, ten (17.2%) were Mycobacterium chelonae and seven (12.1%) were Mycobacterium fortuitum. Fifty-two (89.7%) patients were NTM lung disease, five (8.6%) were pleural disease, and one (1.7%) lymphadenitis. The total positivity of T-SPOT.TB was 53.4% (31/58) among the whole group (probable and definite). For probable cases, the T-SPOT.TB assay was positive in 53.5% (15/28); for definite cases, 16 (53.3%) of 30 definite cases were positive. There was no statistical difference in the positivity rate between them (P \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In the study, we showed that a significant portion of NTM diseases were T-SPOT.TB positive in China.

In addition, further research is needed to investigate the association between TB infection and treatment for NTM patients.","publish_time":"2016-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Mao-Shui; Wang, Jun-Li; Wang, Xin-Feng","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd94afcee3d0c4dbc80b40435ff4fb65487af3b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5124224.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5124224/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NTM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["TB assay","TB positive","T-SPOT","NTM patients","definite NTM diseases","differentiating TB","TB infection","TB-PCR positive","probable diseases","significant portion of NTM diseases","total positivity of T","NTM lung disease","definite cases","IGRA assay","probable cases","China","years","Mycobacterium intracellulare","Mycobacterium chelonae","Mycobacterium fortuitum","interferon-gamma release assay","tuberculin skin test","continuous variables","categorical variables","positivity rate","line drug susceptibility test","retrospective study","pleural disease","useful diagnostic method","indirect proportion method","Jensen","tuberculosis","mean","L\u00F6wenstein","numbers","treatment","standard deviation","limited value","percentages","association","performance","medium","BACKGROUND","average age","statistical difference","discrimination","research","RESULTS","Data","isolates","comparisons","proportions","range","group","manufacturer\u2019s instructions","clinicopathological characteristics","Cultures","mycobacteria","addition","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","male","lymphadenitis"],"language":"en"},

The present study aimed to describe the financing strategies and mechanisms to improve access to public health for all, identify the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches, and showed evidence on equity improvement among different regions. METHODS: We reviewed the relevant literatures and identified 208 articles after screening and quality assessment and conducted six key informants\u2019 interviews. Secondary data on national and local government health expenditures, NEPHSP coverage and health indicators in 2003\u20132014 were collected, descriptive and equity analyses were used. RESULTS: Before 2009, the government subsidy to primary care institutions (PCIs) were mainly used for basic construction and a small part of personnel expenses. Since 2009, the new funds for NEPHSP have significantly expanded service coverage and population coverage. These funds have been allocated by central, provincial, municipal and county governments at different proportions in China\u2019s tax distribution system. Due to the fiscal transfer payment, the Central Government allocated more subsides to less-developed western regions and all the funds were managed in a specific account. Several types of payment methods have been adopted including capitation, pay for performance (P4P), pay for service items, global budget and public health voucher, to address issues from both the supply and demand sides. The equalization of NEPHSP did well through the establishment of health records, systematic care of children and maternal women, etc. Our data showed that the gap between the eastern, central and western regions narrowed. However the coverage for migrants was still low and performance was needed improving in effectiveness of managing patients with chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of essential public health services was highly influenced by public fiscal policy, and the implementation of health reform since 2009 has led the public health development towards the right direction. However China still needs to increase the fiscal investments to expand service coverage as well as promote the quality of public health services and equality among regions. Independent scientific monitoring and evaluation are also needed.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Li; Sun, Li; Wen, Liankui; Zhang, Huyang; Li, Chenyang; Hanson, Kara; Fang, Hai","journal":"Int J Equity Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e687843401f339f6b5e8ae35626d0d0ef0b3e7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5134004.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5134004/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["public health voucher","public health development","health indicators","quality of public health services","delivery of essential public health services","implementation of health reform","NEPHSP coverage","establishment of health records","local government health expenditures","equalization of national essential public health services package","service coverage","public fiscal policy","different regions","Central Government","equalization of NEPHSP","population coverage","western regions","different proportions","government subsidy","different approaches","service items","fiscal transfer payment","fiscal investments","performance","new funds","types of payment methods","quality assessment","Secondary data","equity improvement","equity analyses","systematic care of children","primary care institutions","county governments","evidence","global budget","China\u2019s tax distribution system","articles","PCIs","maternal women","issues","mechanisms","access","equality","financing strategies","effectiveness","screening","P4P","capitation","strengths","right direction","key informants\u2019 interviews","relevant literatures","Independent scientific monitoring","evaluation","patients","chronic diseases","basic construction","supply","weaknesses","gap","migrants","CONCLUSIONS","personnel expenses","demand sides","present study","specific account","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to determine the frequency of detection of specific viral pathogens in children with febrile seizures, to describe risk factors including recent vaccination and clinical features associated with specific etiologies. METHODS: An observational study was performed. Children aged 6 months to 5 years presenting to the Emergency Department of a tertiary children\u2019s hospital in Western Australia with febrile seizures were enrolled between March 2012 and October 2013. Demographic, clinical data and vaccination history were collected, and virological testing was performed on per-nasal and per-rectal samples. RESULTS: One hundred fifty one patients (72 female; median age 1.7y; range 6 m-4y9m) were enrolled. Virological testing was completed for 143/151 (95%). At least one virus was detected in 102/143 patients (71%). The most commonly identified were rhinoviruses (31/143, 22%), adenovirus (30/151, 21%), enteroviruses, (28/143, 20%), influenza (19/143, 13%) and HHV6 (17/143, 12%).

Existing interferon-signaling/receptor-deficient mouse models may not be suitable for evaluating treatment effects of recombinant interferons. METHODS: We developed a novel mouse model for ZIKV infection by immunosuppressing BALB/c mice with dexamethasone. RESULTS: Dexamethasone-immunosuppressed male mice (6\u20138 weeks) developed disseminated infection as evidenced by the detection of ZIKV-NS1 protein expression and high viral loads in multiple organs. They had \u2265 10% weight loss and high clinical scores soon after dexamethasone withdrawal (10 dpi), which warranted euthanasia at 12 dpi. Viral loads in blood and most tissues at 5 dpi were significantly higher than those at 12 dpi (P \u003C 0.05). Histological examination revealed prominent inflammatory infiltrates in multiple organs, and CD45 \u002B and CD8 \u002B inflammatory cells were seen in the testis. These findings suggested that clinical deterioration occurred during viral clearance by host immune response. Type I interferon treatments improved clinical outcome of mice (100% vs 0% survival). CONCLUSIONS: Besides virus dissemination, inflammation of various tissues, especially orchitis, may be potential complications of ZIKV infection with significant implications on disease transmission and male fertility.

Like Spiroplasma mirum, S. eriocheiris infects the newborn mouse (adult mice are not infected) and can cause cataract. Adhesion-related protein is an important protein involved in the interaction between pathogen and host. In this study, the Adhesin-like Protein (ALP) of S. eriocheiris was detected on its outer membrane by using immune electron microscopy, and was found to be involved in the bacterium\u0027s infection of mouse embryo fibroblasts (3T6-Swiss albino). Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that ALP interacts with a diverse group of mouse proteins. The interactions between recombinant partial fibulin7 (FBLN7; including two epidermal growth factor [EGF] domains) and ALP were confirmed by Far-western blotting and colocalization. We synthetized the domains of FBLN7 [EGF domain: amino acids 136\u2013172 and complement control protein (CCP) domain: 81\u2013134 amino acids], and demonstrated that only EGF domain of FBLN7 can interact with ALP. Because the EGF domain has high degree of similarity to EGF, it can activate the downstream EGFR signaling pathway, in key site amino acids. The EGFR pathway in 3T6 cells was restrained after rALP stimulation resulting from competitive binding of ALP to EGF. The unborn mouse, newborn mouse, and the adult mouse with cataract have a small amount of expressed FBLN7; however, none was detected in the brain and very little expression was seen in the eye of normal adult mice. In short, ALP as a S. eriocheiris surface protein, is critical for infection and further supports the role of ALP in S. eriocheiris infection by competitive effection of the EGF/EGFR axis of the target cells.","publish_time":"2017-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Libo; Liu, Yuhan; Gao, Qi; Xu, Xuechuan; Ning, Mingxiao; Bi, Jingxiu; Liu, Hui; Liu, Min; Gu, Wei; Wang, Wen; Meng, Qingguo","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6c72b0d5522ce852bc2aeb711ab57fb75b3489a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5266718.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5266718/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spiroplasma"],"organizations":["ALP","EGFR","EGF/EGFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EGF domain of FBLN7","adult mouse","eriocheiris infection","newborn mouse","role of ALP","eriocheiris surface protein","unborn mouse","Spiroplasma eriocheiris","competitive binding of ALP","important protein","control protein","domains of FBLN7","EGFR pathway","expressed FBLN7","bacterium\u0027s infection of mouse embryo fibroblasts","Adhesion-related protein","diverse group of mouse proteins","3T6 cells","EGFR axis","downstream EGFR","key site amino acids","cataract","eye of normal adult mice","competitive effection","novel pathogen","target cells","Spiroplasma mirum","3T6-Swiss albino","TD","tremor disease","Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis","rALP stimulation","epidermal growth factor","recent years","outer membrane","high degree of similarity","recombinant partial fibulin7","immune electron microscopy","interactions","little expression","hybrid analysis","CCP","Adhesin","western blotting","colocalization","brain","Yeast","host","study"],"language":"en"},

Although the systematic identification of physical interactions between viral proteins and host proteins provides initial information for the recognition of the cellular mechanism involved in viral infection and the development of new therapies, EV71-host protein interactions have not been explored. Here, we identified interactions between EV71 proteins and host cellular proteins and confirmed the functional relationships of EV71-interacting proteins (EIPs) with virus proliferation and infection by integrating a human protein interaction network and by functional annotation. We found that most EIPs had known interactions with other viruses. We also predicted ATP6V0C as a broad-spectrum essential host factor and validated its essentiality for EV71 infection in vitro. EIPs and their interacting proteins were more likely to be targets of anti-inflammatory and neurological drugs, indicating their potential to serve as host-oriented antiviral targets. Thus, we used a connectivity map to find drugs that inhibited EIP expression. We predicted tanespimycin as a candidate and demonstrated its antiviral efficiency in vitro. These findings provide the first systematic identification of EV71-host protein interactions, an analysis of EIP protein characteristics and a demonstration of their value in developing host-oriented antiviral therapies.","publish_time":"2017-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Lu; Li, Kang; Jin, Chaozhi; Wang, Jian; Li, Qingjun; Zhang, Qiling; Cheng, Qiyue; Yang, Jing; Bo, Xiaochen; Wang, Shengqi","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7cbf56502db60d62b5255c560670ef9ced099c30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5318855.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5318855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host proteins","EV71 proteins","EV71-host protein interactions","host cellular proteins","EV71 infection","viral proteins","interacting proteins","host-oriented antiviral targets","systematic identification of EV71","viral infection","developing host-oriented antiviral therapies","functional relationships of EV71","EIPs","broad-spectrum essential host factor","systematic identification of physical interactions","human protein interaction network","analysis of EIP protein characteristics","antiviral efficiency","cellular mechanism","functional annotation","predominant cause of human hand","EIP expression","neurological drugs","development of new therapies","foot","severe consequences","value","demonstration","initial information","public health","mouth disease","serious diseases","result","recognition","enterovirus","essentiality","virus proliferation","ATP6V0C","potential","widespread panic","candidate","connectivity map","findings","viruses","tanespimycin"],"language":"en"},

Many of these arboviruses, such as West Nile, dengue, and Zika viruses, infect humans by way of a bite from an infected mosquito. This infectious inoculum is insect cell-derived giving the virus particles distinct qualities not present in secondary infectious virus particles produced by infected vertebrate host cells. The insect cell-derived particles differ in the glycosylation of virus structural proteins and the lipid content of the envelope, as well as their induction of cytokines. Thus, in order to accurately mimic the inoculum delivered by arthropods, arboviruses should be derived from arthropod cells. Previous studies have packaged replicon genome in mammalian cells to produce replicon particles, which undergo only one round of infection, but no studies exist packaging replicon particles in mosquito cells. Here we optimized the packaging of West Nile virus replicon genome in mosquito cells and produced replicon particles at high concentration, allowing us to mimic mosquito cell-derived viral inoculum. These particles were mature with similar genome equivalents-to-infectious units as full-length West Nile virus. We then compared the mosquito cell-derived particles to mammalian cell-derived particles in mice. Both replicon particles infected skin at the inoculation site and the draining lymph node by 3 hours post-inoculation. The mammalian cell-derived replicon particles spread from the site of inoculation to the spleen and contralateral lymph nodes significantly more than the particles derived from mosquito cells. This in vivo difference in spread of West Nile replicons in the inoculum demonstrates the importance of using arthropod cell-derived particles to model early events in arboviral infection and highlights the value of these novel arthropod cell-derived replicon particles for studying the earliest virus-host interactions for arboviruses.","publish_time":"2017-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boylan, Brendan T.; Moreira, Fernando R.; Carlson, Tim W.; Bernard, Kristen A.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7124df42078edba08ccba1b033dffb0a36f6305.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5322982.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5322982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["mosquito cell-derived particles","arthropod cell-derived particles","mammalian cell-derived particles","mammalian cell-derived replicon particles","insect cell-derived particles","packaging replicon particles","produced replicon particles","novel arthropod cell-derived replicon particles","replicon particles infected skin","secondary infectious virus particles","mosquito cells","virus particles distinct qualities","mosquito cell-derived viral inoculum","arthropod cells","packaging of West Nile virus replicon genome","mammalian cells","infected mosquito","full-length West Nile virus","infectious inoculum","infected vertebrate host cells","arboviruses","earliest virus-host interactions","spread of West Nile replicons","inoculation site","site of inoculation","glycosylation of virus structural proteins","infectious units","arboviral infection","risk of infection","round of infection","similar genome equivalents","hours post-inoculation","Previous studies","draining lymph node","contralateral lymph nodes","Zika viruses","early events","way","lipid content","spleen","value","high concentration","importance","humans","human population","dengue","bite","difference","mice","envelope","Half","arthropods","induction of cytokines","order"],"language":"en"},

The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) causes the TSS/surrounding region to undergo a conformational shift postulated to inhibit translation. Using optical tweezers (OT) and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD), we found that the unusual stability of pseudoknotted element H4a/\u03A8(3) required five upstream adenylates, and H4a/\u03A8(3) was necessary for cooperative association of two other hairpins (H5/H4b) in Mg(2\u002B). SMD recapitulated the TSS unfolding order in the absence of Mg(2\u002B), showed dependence of the resistance to pulling on the 3D orientation and gave structural insights into the measured contour lengths of the TSS structure elements. Adenylate mutations eliminated one-site RdRp binding to the 3\u2019UTR, suggesting that RdRp binding to the adenylates disrupts H4a/\u03A8(3), leading to loss of H5/H4b interaction and promoting a conformational switch interrupting translation and promoting replication.

We sought to identify whether implementation of the nationwide lockdown (shelter-in-place) order in South Africa affected ambulatory clinic visitation in rural Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN). Design Prospective, longitudinal cohort study Setting Data were analyzed from the Africa Health Research Institute Health and Demographic Surveillance System, which includes prospective data capture of clinic visits at eleven primary healthcare clinics in northern KwaZulu-Natal Participants A total of 36,291 individuals made 55,545 clinic visits during the observation period. Exposure of Interest We conducted an interrupted time series analysis with regression discontinuity methods to estimate changes in outpatient clinic visitation from 60 days before through 35 days after the lockdown period. Outcome Measures Daily clinic visitation at ambulatory clinics. In stratified analyses we assessed visitation for the following sub-categories: child health, perinatal care and family planning, HIV services, non-communicable diseases, and by age and sex strata. Results We found no change in total clinic visits/clinic/day from prior to and during the lockdown (-6.9 visits/clinic/day, 95%CI -17.4, 3.7) or trends in clinic visitation over time during the lockdown period (-0.2, 95%CI -3.4, 3.1). We did detect a reduction in child healthcare visits at the lockdown (-7.2 visits/clinic/day, 95%CI -9.2, -5.3), which was seen in both children \u003C1 and children 1-5. In contrast, we found a significant increase in HIV visits immediately after the lockdown (8.4 visits/clinic/day, 95%CI 2.4, 14.4). No other differences in clinic visitation were found for perinatal care and family planning, non-communicable diseases, or among adult men and women. Conclusions In rural KZN, the ambulatory healthcare system was largely resilient during the national-wide lockdown order. A major exception was child healthcare visitation, which declined immediately after the lockdown but began to normalize in the weeks thereafter. Future work should explore efforts to decentralize chronic care for high-risk populations and whether catch-up vaccination programs might be required in the wake of these findings.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siedner, M.

This possibility has been discussed for at least two decades, and careful matching of patient ventilation requirements is advised. However, with a large range of lung compliance and other characteristics, which may also vary with time, good matching is difficult to achieve. Adjusting the impedance of the flow path between ventilator and patient gives the opportunity to control the airway pressure and hence flow and volume individually for each patient. Several groups are now investigating this, in particular the addition of a flow restrictor in the inspiration tube for the patient who is more compliant, or requires a lower tidal volume. In this paper, we show that a simple linear resistance-compliance model, termed the BathRC model, of the ventilator tubing system and lung allows direct calculation of the relationships between pressures, volumes, and required flow restriction. The BathRC model is experimentally validated using a GE Aisys CS2 ventilator connected to two test lungs. The pressure-flow relationships for two restrictors are experimentally determined, and despite the need to approximate them with a linear resistance characteristic, their effect in the breathing circuit is accurately predicted by the simple model. The BathRC model is freely available for download; we do not condone dual ventilation, but this tool is provided to demonstrate that flow restriction can be readily estimated.

Two months later, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced SARS-CoV-2 as the name for the new virus and COVID-19 for the associated illness. On March 12, 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The scientific community has raced to find effective therapeutic agents against the virus. Gautret et al 2020 is among one of the first purportedly positive trials of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. However, it is imperative that a thorough analysis and understanding of trial data be undertaken prior to making claims about safety and efficacy. Our group assessed the statistical robustness of the trial using the Fragility Index (FI). The FI provides a numerical quantification of a clinical trial\u0027s conclusions. The index is based on iterative statistical calculations to determine the minimum number of events within a trial that would theoretically need to change from positive to negative in order for the trial\u0027s endpoint to convert from significant to non-significant; the higher the index, the more statistically robust the study results. For the Gautret et al trial, one endpoint had an FI of 1, two had indices of 2, and another had an index of 4. The primary endpoint of viral clearance on day 6 had an FI of 4. This indicates that if 4 events were to change from positive to negative, the conclusion of the trial would become mathematically non-significant. This index is comparable to many other published trials of established agents; the median FI across the reported literature appears to be 2. In conclusion, the trial results reported by Gautret et al are statistically robust, assuming that data quality is not compromised; however, the study was an open-label trial with non-homogenous groups, with analysis conducted per-protocol. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) testing was not conducted in a systematic way amongst the two groups. Further analyses of this trial and future trials of antiviral agents with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 should be performed with complementary epidemiologic and statistical techniques to determine whether the trial\u0027s results are clinically important and/or should be explored in depth. Given the statistically robust results reported by Gautret et al, despite the study\u0027s inherent methodological and analytical flaws, hydroxychloroquine should be studied as a potential agent against COVID-19 in larger clinical trials.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow, R.; Elsayed, S.; Lock, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfaa14a325f94937d24de8efd4dc8c9b76368c30.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.20093237v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","WHO","FI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["trial results","trial data","Gautret et","trial\u0027s results","robust results","open-label trial","trial\u0027s endpoint","positive trials of hydroxychloroquine","median FI","SARS-CoV","study results","Fragility Index","treatment of COVID","larger clinical trials","future trials of antiviral agents","published trials of established agents","non-homogenous groups","statistical techniques","statistical robustness","clinical trial\u0027s conclusions","reported literature","effective therapeutic agents","iterative statistical calculations","potential activity","RT-PCR","potential agent","primary endpoint of viral clearance","thorough analysis","data quality","new virus","Reverse Transcriptase-PCR","minimum number of events","study\u0027s inherent methodological","novel human coronavirus infection","Wuhan","analytical flaws","day","numerical quantification","outbreak","testing","claims","World Health Organization","months","China","analyses","order","scientific community","systematic way","safety","efficacy","associated illness","protocol","pandemic","indices","depth"],"language":"en"},

Identification of a simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and outcome is urgently needed. Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients. Next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in COVID-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases. Results: Our results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19. LYM% in patients with moderate COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Therefore, we established a reliable Time from symptom onset-LYM% model (TLM), which could be used to evaluate disease severity and predict the outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Lymphopenia can be used to indicate clinical course, treatment effect and outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Li; Wang, Qi; Zhang, Duanyang; Ding, Jinya; Huang, Qianchuan; Tang, Yi-Quan; Wang, Qiongshu; Miao, Hongming","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f19e2df932f90f387fe71533f3802875d9042160.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029074","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe cases","moderate cases of COVID","death cases","severity of COVID","hospitalized cases","outcomes of COVID","moderate COVID","symptom onset-LYM","disease severity","outcomes of hospitalized patients","Coronavirus disease","Results","days","prognostic role of lymphopenia","effective indicator","dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage","treatment effect","clinical course","study","model","reliable Time","escalating epidemic","SARS-CoV","Identification","blood test","TLM","progression","Methods","Background","contrast","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR. Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%\uFF0C68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Guanmin; Ren, Xiaoshuai; Liu, Yan; Chen, Hongtao; Liu, Wei; Guo, Zhaowang; Zhang, Yaqin; Chen, Chaoqun; Zhou, Jianhui; Xiao, Qiang; Shan, Hong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e046a06f262d74d025272ad697d358c4afb5d9bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027755","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive RT-PCR","RT-PCR tests","stool RT-PCR results","value of stool RT-PCR","Combination of RT","pharyngeal swab RT-PCR","performances of RT","chest CT","diagnosing COVID","consecutive positive stool","confirmed COVID","exclusion cases","negative pharyngeal swabs","SARS-CoV","efficient screening pattern","monitoring of SARS","highest sensitivity","scheme of screening","Coronavirus Disease","inconsistent results","optimal pattern","higher sensitivity","kappa-value","mild infections","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","discovery rate","item","diagnostic accuracy","records","demographics","time","hospital discharge","good agreement","global threat","public health","light","Background","patients","Findings","Interpretation","study","Methods","course"],"language":"en"},

We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells.

The aim of this study was to derive and validate risk prediction models for poor outcome and death in adult inpatients with COVID-19. Methods Model derivation using data from Wuhan, China used logistic regression with death and poor outcome (death or severe disease) as outcomes. Predictors were demographic, comorbidity, symptom and laboratory test variables. The best performing models were externally validated in data from London, UK. Findings 4.3% of the derivation cohort (n=775) died and 9.7% had a poor outcome, compared to 34.1% and 42.9% of the validation cohort (n=226). In derivation, prediction models based on age, sex, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, C-reactive protein and creatinine had excellent discrimination (death c-index=0.91, poor outcome c-index=0.88), with good-to-excellent calibration. Using two cut-offs to define low, high and very-high risk groups, derivation patients were stratified in groups with observed death rates of 0.34%, 15.0% and 28.3% and poor outcome rates 0.63%, 8.9% and 58.5%. External validation discrimination was good (c-index death=0.74, poor outcome=0.72) as was calibration. However, observed rates of death were 16.5%, 42.9% and 58.4% and poor outcome 26.3%, 28.4% and 64.8% in predicted low, high and very-high risk groups. Interpretation Our prediction model using demography and routinely-available laboratory tests performed very well in internal validation in the lower-risk derivation population, but less well in the much higher-risk external validation population. Further external validation is needed. Collaboration to create larger derivation datasets, and to rapidly externally validate all proposed prediction models in a range of populations is needed, before routine implementation of any risk prediction tool in clinical care.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, H.; Shi, T.; Wu, X.; Zhang, X.; Wang, K.; Bean, D.; Dobson, R.; Teo, J.

This study considered a gravity model that expressed time to first case as a function of multiple socio-economic factors. First, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for each variable in the model by dividing countries into two groups according to the median of the respective variable. In order to measure the effect of these variables, parameters of the gravity model were estimated using accelerated failure time (AFT) survival analysis. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis the differences between high and low value groups were significant for every variable except population. The AFT analysis determined that increased personal freedom had the largest effect on lowering the survival time, controlling for detection capacity. Higher GDP per capita and a larger population also reduced survival time, while a greater distance from the outbreak source increased it.

The additive seasonal effects of outdoor temperatures and indoor relative humidity (RH) were evaluated. The 8-year average peak activity of human coronaviruses occurred in the first week of January, when droplet and contact transmission was enabled by the low indoor RH of 20-30%. Previous studies have shown that an increase in RH to 50% has been associated with markedly reduced viability and transmission of influenza virus and animal coronaviruses. As disease incidence was reduced by 50% in early March, to 75% in early April, to greater than 99% at the end of April, a relationship was observed from colder temperatures in January with a low indoor RH to a gradual increase in outdoor temperatures in April with an indoor RH of 45-50%. As a lipid-bound, enveloped virus with similar size characteristics to endemic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 should be subject to the same dynamics of reduced viability and transmission with increased humidity. In addition to the major role of social distancing, the transition from lower to higher indoor RH with increasing outdoor temperatures could have an additive effect on the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 cases in May. Over the 8-year period of this study, human coronavirus activity was either zero or \u003E99% reduction in the months of June through September, and the implication would be that SARS-Cov-2 may follow a similar pattern.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evangelista, A.

Our aim was to assess the potential effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for COVID-19 in children. Methods: Electronic databases from their inception to March, 31 2020 were searched for randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials and cohort studies of interventions with antiviral agents for children (less than 18 years of age) with COVID-19. Results: A total of 23 studies of indirect evidence with 6008 patients were included. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate to high in general. The effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 is uncertain: For adults with COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir had no effect on mortality (risk ratio [RR]= 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 1.30) and probability of negative PCR test (RR=0.98, 95 CI% 0.82 to 1.18).

Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with increasing the probability of negative PCR result (RR=0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18). For adults with SARS, interferon was associated with reduced corticosteroid dose (weighted mean difference [WMD]=-0.14 g, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.07) but had no effect on mortality (RR=0.72, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.88); ribavirin did not reduce mortality (RR=0.68, 95% CI % 0.43 to 1.06) and was associated with high risk of severe adverse reactions; and oseltamivir had no effect on mortality (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.38). Ribavirin combined with interferon was also not effective in adults with MERS and associated with adverse reactions. Conclusions: There is no evidence showing the effectiveness of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19, and the clinical efficacy of existing antiviral agents is still uncertain.

However, the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic in Shenzhen, China remains unknown. Individual data of 417 cases were extracted from the epidemiological investigations and the National Infectious Disease Information System between January 1, 2020 and February 29, 2020. On the basis of important interventions, the epidemic was divided into four periods (January 1-15, January 16-22, January 23-February 5 and after February 6). We used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-asymptomatic-recovered model to evaluate the effect of interventions. Results suggested that about 53.7% were imported from Wuhan. The median age was 47 years and 52.8% were women. Severity risk increased with age and associated with male and co-existing disorders. The attack rate peaked in the third period and drastically decreased afterwards across sex, age groups and geographic regions. Children younger than 5 years showed a higher attack rate than those aged of 6~19.

These findings may facilitate the introduction of public health policies in other countries and regions.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, S.; Zhang, Z.; Wu, Y.; Mei, S.; Li, Y.; Xie, X.; Liu, X.; Tang, X.; Kong, D.; Wu, X.; Wei, L.; Lv, Z.; Yu, S.; Wen, Y.; Zhou, G.; Chen, T.; Feng, T.; Zou, X.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef00840aea57d3a540fc04062cf70f7690738740.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.09.20084202v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Infectious Disease Information System"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["effect of interventions","effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions","epidemic","years","Shenzhen","age groups","COVID","basis of important interventions","median age","China","higher attack rate","infectious-asymptomatic","geographic regions","National Infectious Disease Information System","novel coronavirus disease","epidemiological investigations","characteristics of patients","sex","introduction of public health policies","cases","countries","model","co-existing disorders","highest level emergency response","outbreak","Previous studies","Children younger","effective reproductive number","Individual data","findings","Severity risk","women","periods","Results","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

PIAS is effective against many pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, and viral particles irrespective of their species or drug-resistance status. Animal experiments demonstrated that PIAS saved mice from fatal infections; microbiome and histochemical analyses indicated no apparent effect on normal host microflora and tissues in PIAS-treated mice. Resistance to PIAS was not observed during the eight years of this study. As a new type of anti-infection therapy, PIAS may contribute to advances in anti-infection strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitsunaga, Makoto; Ito, Kimihiro; Nishimura, Takashi; Miyata, Hironori; Mizunoe, Yoshimitsu; Kobayashi, Hisataka; Iwase, Tadayuki","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.049791","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PIAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PIAS-treated mice","anti-pathogen antibody","anti-infection strategies","new type of anti-infection therapy","drug-resistant strains","drug-resistance status","emergence of new microbial pathogens","antibody-targets","fungal pathogen Candida albicans","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","apparent effect","MRSA","tissues","normal host microflora","histochemical analyses","mechanical stress","microbiome","viral particles","fatal infections","treatment","species","advances","target\u2019s binding sites","photoimmuno-antimicrobial strategy","Animal experiments","global health","years","study"],"language":"en"},

In this work we focus on the evolution of the COVID-19 in one of the most populous Brazilian states, namely the Rio de Janeiro state. The first case was reported in March 5, 2020, thus we have a considerable amount of available data to make a good analysis. First we study the early evolution of the disease, considering a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model. This initial phase shows the usual exponential growth of the number of confirmed cases. In this case, we estimate the parameters of the model based on the data, as well as the epidemic doubling time. After, we analyze all the available data, from March 5, 2020 through April 26, 2020. In this case, we observe a distinct behavior: a sub-exponential growth. In order to capture this change in the behavior of the evolution of the confirmed cases, we consider the implementation of isolation policies. The modified model agrees well with data. Finally, we consider the relaxation of such policies, and discuss about the ideal period of time to release people to return to their activities.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crokidakis, N.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/beb7b002836a0e62e956a7050426bb4619688b78.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20081737v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Rio de Janeiro"],"keyphrases":["available data","early evolution","modified model","COVID","usual exponential growth","sub-exponential growth","number of confirmed cases","distinct behavior","ideal period of time","epidemic doubling time","implementation of isolation policies","people","disease","initial phase","populous Brazilian states","change","good analysis","Susceptible-Infectious","Janeiro state","recent Coronavirus","SIQR","parameters","order","activities","relaxation","work","world"],"language":"en"},

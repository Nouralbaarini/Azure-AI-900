To help scientists and policymakers navigate technological and ethical uncertainty, we present a typology of the primary digital public health applications currently in use.

In the United States, the country with the highest confirmed COVID-19 infection cases, a nationwide social distancing protocol has been implemented by the President. For the first time in a hundred years since the 1918 flu pandemic, the US population is mandated to stay in their households and avoid public contact. As a result, the majority of public venues and services have ceased their operations. Following the closure of the University of Washington on March 7th, more than a thousand colleges and universities in the United States have cancelled in-person classes and campus activities, impacting millions of students. This paper aims to discover the social implications of this unprecedented disruption in our interactive society regarding both the general public and higher education populations by mining people\u0027s opinions on social media. We discover several topics embedded in a large number of COVID-19 tweets that represent the most central issues related to the pandemic, which are of great concerns for both college students and the general public. Moreover, we find significant differences between these two groups of Twitter users with respect to the sentiments they expressed towards the COVID-19 issues. To our best knowledge, this is the first social media-based study which focuses on the college student community\u0027s demographics and responses to prevalent social issues during a major crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duong, Viet; Pham, Phu; Yang, Tongyu; Wang, Yu; Luo, Jiebo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d40f76055a7c28dd30c8b8f60c31724f8991cd8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09968v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["social implications","prevalent social issues","general public","public contact","social media-based study","nationwide social distancing protocol","college students","highest confirmed COVID","majority of public venues","flu pandemic","large number of COVID","United States","central issues","millions of students","college student community\u0027s demographics","infection cases","higher education populations","mining people\u0027s opinions","responses","campus activities","person classes","unprecedented disruption","interactive society","tweets","country","groups of Twitter users","respect","services","sentiments","novel Coronavirus Disease","great concerns","major crisis","years","US population","governments","result","colleges","universities","significant differences","closure","University of Washington","ultimate challenges","topics","operations","households","paper","best knowledge","President"],"language":"en"},

However, it is still unclear how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies between different surfaces. To address these questions, we conducted systematic experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer and human-exhaled gas on different surfaces. We found that these droplets do not disappear immediately with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers (referred to as residues) which can stay on a surface for more than 24 hours. The evaporation characteristics of these residues change significantly with surface types. Specifically, the surfaces with high thermal conductivity like copper do not leave any resolvable residues, while stainless steel, plastic and glass surfaces form residues that remain stable for extended durations. Lowering humidity can significantly suppress the formation of residues. Such trends are well correlated with SARS-CoV-2 survivability measurements in the literature. Our results suggest that these microscale residues can potentially insulate the virus against environmental changes, allowing them to survive inhospitable environments and remain infectious for prolonged durations after deposition. Our findings are also applicable for other viruses that are transmitted through respiratory droplets (e.g., SARS-CoV-1, flu viruses, etc.), and can lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces of different types and other prevention measures (e.g., humidity control) for limiting virus infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, S.

In this article, both the mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen\u0027s work are analysed that relate to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen\u0027s relational models are a particular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions rather than a different kind of model that excludes mechanistic models. The strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison with current network biology literature.

Such computational approaches can further our understanding of this protein structure and complement laboratory efforts.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Samuel W.K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b646b265b463a5ab9626287a1726881fa922700.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07550v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein structure","dimensional structure","specific spike protein","ongoing mutations","different amino acid sequences","thorough understanding","result of mutations","key role","key segment","energy conformations","possible changes","space of low","sequential Monte Carlo sampling method","potential structural impacts","data science perspective","infectiousness","human cells","effective therapeutic interventions","time","laboratory efforts","novel coronavirus","paper","Proteins","computational approaches"],"language":"en"},

Doing this early would save millions of lives and help countries keep a stable economy. The easiest way to control the spread of a virus is to immediately inform the individuals who recently had close contact with the diagnosed patients. However, to achieve this, a centralized authority (e.g., a health authority) needs detailed location information from both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients. Thus, such an approach, although beneficial to control the spread of a virus, results in serious privacy concerns, and hence privacy-preserving solutions are required to solve this problem. Previous works on this topic either (i) compromise privacy (especially privacy of diagnosed patients) to have better efficiency or (ii) provide unscalable solutions. In this work, we propose a technique based on private set intersection between physical contact histories of individuals (that are recorded using smart phones) and a centralized database (run by a health authority) that keeps the identities of the positive diagnosed patients for the disease. Proposed solution protects the location privacy of both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients and it guarantees that the identities of the diagnosed patients remain hidden from other individuals. Notably, proposed scheme allows individuals to receive warning messages indicating their previous contacts with a positive diagnosed patient. Such warning messages will help them realize the risk and isolate themselves from other people. We make sure that the warning messages are only observed by the corresponding individuals and not by the health authority. We also implement the proposed scheme and show its efficiency and scalability via simulations.","publish_time":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Demirag, Didem; Ayday, Erman","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ded1b304dbf83825056115e67f68d3f7f48339d5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13073v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["privacy of diagnosed patients","positive diagnosed patients","healthy individuals","corresponding individuals","location privacy","health authority","compromise privacy","virus","warning messages","centralized authority","spread","physical contact histories of individuals","proposed scheme","serious privacy concerns","identities","countries","Proposed solution","previous contacts","close contact","centralized database","better efficiency","Previous works","unscalable solutions","detailed location information","private set intersection","results","technique","topic","millions of lives","smart phones","crucial need","scalability","disease","stable economy","simulations","risk","easiest way","approach","people","problem"],"language":"en"},

Using this model, we were able to reproduce the real behavior of the epidemic with an average error of 5\\%. Moreover, we illustrate possible future scenarios, associated to different intervals of $R_0$. This model has been used since the beginning of March 2020, predicting the Italian peak of the epidemic in April 2020 with about 100.000 detected active cases.

We provide a flexible modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made. We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation in the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as medical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with different scenarios. This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR). It is important to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model, are not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used with extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent uncertainty to be incorporated.

The absence of any active therapeutic agents and the lack of immunity against COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of the population. Since there are no vaccines available, social distancing is the only feasible approach to fight against this pandemic. Motivated by this notion, this article proposes a deep learning based framework for automating the task of monitoring social distancing using surveillance video. The proposed framework utilizes the YOLO v3 object detection model to segregate humans from the background and Deepsort approach to track the identified people with the help of bounding boxes and assigned IDs. The results of the YOLO v3 model are further compared with other popular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolution neural network) and single shot detector (SSD) in terms of mean average precision (mAP), frames per second (FPS) and loss values defined by object classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm is computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index term is proposed to quantize the non adoption of social distancing protocol. From the experimental analysis, it is observed that the YOLO v3 with Deepsort tracking scheme displayed best results with balanced mAP and FPS score to monitor the social distancing in real-time.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Punn, Narinder Singh; Sonbhadra, Sanjay Kumar; Agarwal, Sonali","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b945eadc218ad506d97904b1b1e6ba105302b98c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01385v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YOLO","CNN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["YOLO v3 model","task of monitoring social distancing","adoption of social distancing protocol","YOLO v3 object detection model","Deepsort approach","proposed framework","COVID","deep learning based framework","balanced mAP","best results","FPS score","faster region-based CNN","object classification","feasible approach","bounding box","Deepsort tracking scheme","convolution neural network","humans","single shot detector","SSD","terms of mean average precision","loss values","centroid coordinates","frames","second","article","active therapeutic agents","popular state-of-the-art models","lack of immunity","identified people","surveillance video","countries","help","deadly spread","dimensions","background","global crisis","three-dimensional feature space","confirmed cases","boxes","absence","rampant coronavirus disease","fight","pandemic","localization","vaccines available","vectorized L2 norm","violation index term","deaths","IDs","notion","vulnerability","experimental analysis","population"],"language":"en"},

However, the lack of adequate testing kits could be a bottleneck, especially in the case of unanticipated new diseases, such as COVID-19, where the testing technology, manufacturing capability, distribution, human skills and laboratories might be unavailable or in short supply. In addition, the cost of the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for poorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a test methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single test. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample likely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It thereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore, requires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat increased false negatives. Our simulations show that combining samples from two patients with 7% underlying likelihood of infection implies that 36% fewer test kits are required, with 14% additional units of time for testing.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jain, Tarun; Jain, Bijendra Nath","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a08674b5a5c8e4a817cf0ccc09b98c003a9fb1d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13282v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single test","fewer test kits","poorer patients","individual patients","test methodology","negative infection","standard PCR test","testing technology","single negative result","spread of infection","bottleneck","fewer tests","lack of adequate testing kits","underlying likelihood of infection","pooled sample","distribution","human skills","manufacturing capability","laboratories","containment","public health authorities","pandemics","epidemics","case of unanticipated new diseases","COVID","mitigation","cost","USD","key insight","future responses","additional units of time","governments","large number of individuals","short supply","increased false negatives","samples","line of treatment","simulations","protocol"],"language":"en"},

Novel coronavirus (nCoV), also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is responsible for this deadly disease. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has declared that nCoV is highly genetically similar to SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 (89% similarity). Limited number of clinically validated Human-nCoV protein interaction data is available in the literature. With this hypothesis, the present work focuses on developing a computational model for nCoV-Human protein interaction network, using the experimentally validated SARS-CoV-Human protein interactions. Initially, level-1 and level-2 human spreader proteins are identified in SARS-CoV-Human interaction network, using Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. These proteins are considered as potential human targets for nCoV bait proteins. A gene-ontology based fuzzy affinity function has been used to construct the nCoV-Human protein interaction network at 99.98% specificity threshold. This also identifies the level-1 human spreaders for COVID-19 in human protein-interaction network. Level-2 human spreaders are subsequently identified using the SIS model. The derived host-pathogen interaction network is finally validated using 7 potential FDA listed drugs for COVID-19 with significant overlap between the known drug target proteins and the identified spreader proteins.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saha, Sovan; Halder, Anup Kumar; Bandyopadhyay, Soumyendu Sekhar; Chatterjee, Piyali; Nasipuri, Mita; Basu, Subhadip","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b51b4acf0c67ab0a7c09cc4225896843a0af652b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04108v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Committee","SIS","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Human interaction network","human protein-interaction network","nCoV-Human protein interaction network","human spreaders","human spreader proteins","Human protein interactions","validated Human-nCoV protein interaction data","potential human targets","nCoV bait proteins","level","validated SARS-CoV","identified spreader proteins","COVID","derived host-pathogen interaction network","SARS-CoV epidemic","SARS-CoV2","SIS model","known drug target proteins","computational model","Susceptible-Infected","potential FDA","Novel coronavirus","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","significant overlap","global pandemic","Taxonomy of Viruses","gene-ontology","fuzzy affinity function","high morbidity","mortality","ICTV","drugs","International Committee","present work","Limited number","specificity threshold","literature","deadly disease","hypothesis","similarity"],"language":"en"},

RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests are accurate but costly, making regular testing of every individual expensive. The costs are a challenge for all countries and particularly for developing countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by combining samples and testing them in groups. We propose an algorithm for grouping subsamples, prior to testing, based on the geometry of a hypercube. At low prevalence, this testing procedure uniquely identifies infected individuals in a small number of tests. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, parallel searches are preferred. We report proof of concept experiments in which a positive sample was detected even when diluted a hundred-fold with negative samples. Using these methods, the costs of mass testing could be reduced by a factor of ten to a hundred or more. If infected individuals are quickly and effectively quarantined, the prevalence will fall and so will the costs of regularly testing everyone. Such a strategy provides a possible pathway to the longterm elimination of SARS-CoV-2.

Moreover, our results reveal that individual municipalities\u0027 actions do not cause a high impact on mobility restrain since they tend to be punctual and disconnected to the country scene as a whole.

Here, we analyzed the temporal changes in i) human mobility behavior, ii) social contact rates, and iii) correlations between changes in such mobility metrics with the transmissibility of COVID-19, using anonymized large-scale mobility data collected from more than 200K mobile phone users in Tokyo, Japan. The analysis concludes that by April 15th (1 week from declaring state of emergency), aggregated quantities characterizing human mobility behavior decreased by around 50%, resulting in a 70% reduction of social contacts in Tokyo, showing the effectiveness of non-compulsory measures.

Since the Benard-von Karman vortex street, a product of the von Karman instability, cannot occur in porous media with a low porosity, a build-up of vortices in the void space is observed to cause a complex interaction between the vortices. When the von Karman instability emerges in microscopic flow within a homogeneous porous medium consisting of periodically arranged solid obstacles, the confinement that is inherent in the medium causes the macroscopic flow to deviate from the principal flow direction. The causation is investigated, and several governing parameters are identified. A breakdown of the transient process from aligned to deviatory flow is provided to illustrate the developmental stages.

One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID19 is essentially unknow. Without this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. It includes why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell, and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in the innate immune defense. Here we propose a striking yet plausible amplification mechanism in the immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our calculated results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100000 folds, resembling the cyclic O3-depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can cause many diseases such as autoimmune disorders, aging and cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of invading pathogens (COVID19), cancer and other diseases, and provide a molecular mechanism of action of the drugs or candidates.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Qing-Bin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43191331b990274f031f42488882f299c6fe012f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02631v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNS","ROS/RNS","RHS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RHS effects","endogenous ROS","defense system","RHS pathogen","RNS level","innate immune defense","low level of endogenous RHS","halogen cyclic reactions","ROS-induced injury","successful treatment","adverse effects","pathology of COVID19","diseases","cancer","molecule","formation of H2O2","cyclic O3-depleting reactions","crucial physiological roles","class of potent drugs","specific antiviral treatment","crucial role","effective treatment of invading pathogens","ozone-depleting","cell metabolism","required protective","plausible amplification mechanism","molecular mechanism of action","mentioned physiological functions","nitrogen species","key biological processes of reactive oxygen","reaction cycles","fold lower","relevant doses","drug repurposing research","organisms","plants","ionizing radiation","angel","repeated thousands of times","current focus","dysfunction","enzymes","human health","therapeutic efficacies","vaccine","folds","calculated results","paper","humans","autoimmune disorders","stratosphere","clinical use","superoxide dismutases","global pandemic","candidates","understanding"],"language":"en"},

In addition, the model is dynamic in the sense that it takes into account the policy measures introduced when we solve the inverse problem. The results obtained in Spain have particular practical relevance: the number of infected individuals can be $17$ times higher than the data provided by the Spanish government on April $26$ $th$ in the worst-case scenario.

Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded) relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000 tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent serological studies.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Friston, Karl J.; Parr, Thomas; Zeidman, Peter; Razi, Adeel; Flandin, Guillaume; Daunizeau, Jean; Hulme, Oliver J.; Billig, Alexander J.; Litvak, Vladimir; Price, Cathy J.; Moran, Rosalyn J.; Lambert, Christian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edfc9c542b75092b7000be09fd4496c4122c28d7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07994v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wave","model parameters","isolation state","time horizon","efficacy of tracing","dynamic causal model of COVID","powerful tracking","tracing policy","time of writing","UK","tests","asymptomatic infected cases","time series of new cases","effects of self-isolation consequent","testing strategy","clear-cut conclusions","current testing capabilities","Germany","daily deaths","rebound of infections","comparative analysis","United Kingdom","relaxations of social distancing","maximum posteriori estimates","face validation","people","recent serological studies","weeks","mortality rates","deferment","construct","trajectory","quarantine","simulations","month period","outbreak","months","immunity","example","day","emergence"],"language":"en"},

Fighting this infodemic is now ranked second on the list of the most important focus areas of the World Health Organization, with dangers ranging from promoting fake cures, rumors, and conspiracy theories to spreading xenophobia and panic. The fight requires solving a number of problems such as identifying tweets containing claims, determining their check-worthiness and factuality, and their potential to do harm as well as the nature of that harm, to mention just a few. These are challenging problems, and some of them have been studied previously, but typically in isolation. Here, we design, annotate, and release to the research community a new dataset for fine-grained disinformation analysis that (i) focuses on COVID-19, (ii) combines the perspectives and the interests of journalists, fact-checkers, social media platforms, policy makers, and society as a whole, and (iii) covers both English and Arabic.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alam, Firoj; Shaar, Shaden; Nikolov, Alex; Mubarak, Hamdy; Martino, Giovanni Da San; Abdelali, Ahmed; Dalvi, Fahim; Durrani, Nadir; Sajjad, Hassan; Darwish, Kareem; Nakov, Preslav","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e423a015034fe09fbf7890ba8f2fa5a3b877a5c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00033v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["harm","society","COVID","social media platforms","fine-grained disinformation analysis","new dataset","new level","medical aspects","number of problems","medical issues","political purposes","challenging problems","global infodemic","fact-checkers","important focus areas","World Health Organization","conspiracy theories","research community","policy makers","dangers","fake cures","interests of journalists","check-worthiness","rumors","tweets","claims","pandemic","factuality","xenophobia","panic","release","potential","elections","perspectives","use of vaccines","distrust","fight","emergence","nature","Arabic","isolation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20\u201391 years old) who did not receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China. Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4 days) or progressive-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4\u20137 days) for analysis. CT characteristics and the distribution, size, and CT score of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were assessed. RESULTS: In our study, the major characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 was ground-glass opacity (61.3%), followed by ground-glass opacity with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacities (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%). No patient presented cavitation, a reticular pattern, or bronchial wall thickening. The CT scores of the progressive-stage group were significantly greater than those of the early-stage group (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple ground-glass opacities with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019. CT score can be used to evaluate the severity of the disease. If these typical alterations are found, then the differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 must be considered.

Effective antiviral agents are lacking that specifically target RNA viruses such as measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses, and available vaccinations have demonstrated variable efficacy. Therefore, the development of novel antiviral agents is needed to close the vaccination gap and silence outbreaks. We previously indentified mucroporin, a cationic host defense peptide from scorpion venom, which can effectively inhibit standard bacteria. The optimized mucroporin-M1 can inhibit gram-positive bacteria at low concentrations and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In this investigation, we further tested mucroporin and the optimized mucroporin-M1 for their antiviral activity. Surprisingly, we found that the antiviral activities of mucroporin-M1 against measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses were notably increased with an EC50 of 7.15\u03BCg/ml (3.52\u03BCM) and a CC50 of 70.46\u03BCg/ml (34.70\u03BCM) against measles virus, an EC50 of 14.46\u03BCg/ml (7.12\u03BCM) against SARS-CoV and an EC50 of 2.10\u03BCg/ml (1.03\u03BCM) against H5N1, while the original peptide mucroporin showed no antiviral activity against any of these three viruses. The inhibition model could be via a direct interaction with the virus envelope, thereby decreasing the infectivity of virus. This report provides evidence that host defense peptides from scorpion venom can be modified for antiviral activity by rational design and represents a practical approach for developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents, especially against RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2011-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Qiaoli; Zhao, Zhenhuan; Zhou, Dihan; Chen, Yaoqing; Hong, Wei; Cao, Luyang; Yang, Jingyi; Zhang, Yan; Shi, Wei; Cao, Zhijian; Wu, Yingliang; Yan, Huimin; Li, Wenxin","journal":"Peptides","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04493bf92e3c45eb1482e9abf869bd73cb2cdb40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115635.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2011.05.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196978111002075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21620914/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196978111002075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["measles viruses","antiviral activity","antiviral activities of mucroporin","influenza H5N1 viruses","SARS-CoV","RNA viruses","\u03BCg","\u03BCM","optimized mucroporin-M1","broad-spectrum antiviral agents","Effective antiviral agents","indentified mucroporin","original peptide mucroporin","development of novel antiviral agents","EC50","Abstract Outbreaks of SARS","scorpion venom","virus envelope","infectivity of virus","cationic host defense peptide","host defense peptides","available vaccinations","measures available","gram-positive bacteria","silence outbreaks","standard bacteria","low concentrations","practical approach","serious concerns","recent years","evidence","rational design","antibiotic-resistant pathogens","H1N1","direct interaction","report","vaccination gap","infectious viral diseases","variable efficacy","inhibition model","CC50","investigation"],"language":"en"},

We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19. METHODS: In Singapore, active case-finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID-19 cases. Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT-PCR testing. When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection. FINDINGS: Three clusters of COVID-19, comprising 28 locally transmitted cases, were identified in Singapore; these clusters were from two churches (Church A and Church B) and a family gathering. The clusters in Church A and Church B were linked by an individual from Church A (A2), who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to the primary case from Church B (F1) at a family gathering they both attended on Jan 25, 2020. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative. This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing. ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1\u00B74 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320. INTERPRETATION: Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID-19 clusters in Singapore. Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods.

Interpretation of titers is not generally accepted. HYPOTHESIS: The magnitude of S. equi M protein (SeM) antibody titer after infection (titer \u22651:12 800) will be useful to monitor for the presence of complications or the risk of development of complications. ANIMALS: Forty\u2010eight horses on 1 farm involved in strangles outbreak. METHODS: Clinical and observational study. S. equi M protein antibody titers were measured on all horses 8 weeks after infection and select horses 12 and 28 weeks after infection. Horses were categorized: no disease, uncomplicated case, persistent guttural pouch (GP) infection, or complicated cases (metastatic abscesses, purpura hemorrhagica, secondary infections, and dysphagia). Category was compared to titer. RESULTS: Twenty\u2010eight of 48 (58%) developed clinical signs of S. equi infection. Of those, 11 (39%) had uncomplicated strangles, 9 (21%) had persistent GP infection, 5 (18%) were complicated cases, and 3 (11%) had both persistent GP infection and complications. Thirty\u2010three percent of horses (16 of 48) had SeM antibody titers \u22651:12 800 eight weeks after infection. Of horses with titers \u22651:12 800, 6 of 16 had evidence of complications. Of complicated cases, 6 of 8 had titers \u22651:12 800. In this outbreak, the sensitivity (75%; 95% CI [confidence interval] 45\u2010105) for a SeM antibody titer \u22651:12 800 detecting complications was higher than the specificity (43%; 95% CI 23\u201064).

To date, little is known about the host factors or cellular signaling mechanisms associated with PDCoV replication. Since the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is involved in modulation of various important cellular functions, numerous DNA and RNA viruses coopt this pathway for efficient propagation. In the present study, we found that PDCoV induces the activation of ERK1/2 and its downstream substrate Elk-1 early in infection irrespective of viral biosynthesis. Chemical inhibition or knockdown of ERK1/2 significantly suppressed viral replication, whereas treatment with an ERK activator increased viral yields. Direct pharmacological inhibition of ERK activation had no effect on the viral entry process but sequentially affected the post-entry steps of the virus life cycle. In addition, pharmacological sequestration of cellular or viral cholesterol downregulated PDCoV-induced ERK signaling, highlighting the significance of the cholesterol contents in ERK activation. However, ERK inhibition had no effect on PDCoV-triggered apoptosis through activation of the cytochrome c-mediated intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, suggesting the irrelevance of ERK activation to the apoptosis pathway during PDCoV infection. Altogether, our findings indicate that the ERK signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in viral biosynthesis to facilitate the optimal replication of PDCoV.","publish_time":"2020-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeon, Ji Hyun; Lee, Yoo Jin; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3eb9aa04ddf6a74a7c4bebb18729b62c0be81d2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f5bd8fd244e3f6db6e2c8c9bae57d44ecdeda9c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194644.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170219308603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283129/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170219308603; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197961","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ERK pathway","ERK inhibition","PDCoV replication","irrelevance of ERK activation","ERK activator","viral replication","PDCoV infection","viral cholesterol downregulated PDCoV-induced ERK","viral biosynthesis","Direct pharmacological inhibition of ERK activation","optimal replication of PDCoV","apoptosis pathway","viral yields","activation of ERK1","PDCoV-triggered apoptosis","viral entry process","intrinsic mitochondrial pathway","pharmacological sequestration of cellular","effect","Chemical inhibition","cholesterol contents","knockdown of ERK1","modulation of various important cellular functions","post-entry steps","numerous DNA","RNA viruses","cytochrome c","acute enteritis","emerged swine coronavirus","mechanisms","significance","pivotal role","virus life cycle","treatment","neonatal piglets","efficient propagation","downstream substrate Elk","host factors","addition","Raf","MEK","Porcine deltacoronavirus","present study","findings","date"],"language":"en"},

RI panels are popular because of their long-term genetic stability, which enhances reproducibility and integration of data collected across time and conditions. Characterization of their genomes can be a community effort, reducing the burden on individual users. Here we present the genomes of the CC strains using two complementary approaches as a resource to improve power and interpretation of genetic experiments. Our study also provides a cautionary tale regarding the limitations imposed by such basic biological processes as mutation and selection. A distinct advantage of inbred panels is that genotyping only needs to be performed on the panel, not on each individual mouse. The initial CC genome data were haplotype reconstructions based on dense genotyping of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of each strain followed by imputation from the genome sequence of the corresponding founder inbred strain. The MRCA resource captured segregating regions in strains that were not fully inbred, but it had limited resolution in the transition regions between founder haplotypes, and there was uncertainty about founder assignment in regions of limited diversity. Here we report the whole genome sequence of 69 CC strains generated by paired-end short reads at 30\u00D7 coverage of a single male per strain. Sequencing leads to a substantial improvement in the fine structure and completeness of the genomes of the CC. Both MRCAs and sequenced samples show a significant reduction in the genome-wide haplotype frequencies from two wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ. In addition, analysis of the evolution of the patterns of heterozygosity indicates that selection against three wild-derived founder strains played a significant role in shaping the genomes of the CC. The sequencing resource provides the first description of tens of thousands of new genetic variants introduced by mutation and drift in the CC genomes. We estimate that new SNP mutations are accumulating in each CC strain at a rate of 2.4 \u00B1 0.4 per gigabase per generation. The fixation of new mutations by genetic drift has introduced thousands of new variants into the CC strains. The majority of these mutations are novel compared to currently sequenced laboratory stocks and wild mice, and some are predicted to alter gene function. Approximately one-third of the CC inbred strains have acquired large deletions (\u003E10 kb) many of which overlap known coding genes and functional elements. The sequence of these mice is a critical resource to CC users, increases threefold the number of mouse inbred strain genomes available publicly, and provides insight into the effect of mutation and drift on common resources.","publish_time":"2017-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Srivastava, Anuj; Morgan, Andrew P.; Najarian, Maya L.; Sarsani, Vishal Kumar; Sigmon, J.

Infection with PRRSV leads to reproductive complications, respiratory illness, and weak immunity to secondary infections. To better control PRRSV infection, novel approaches for generating control measures are critically needed. Here, in vitro Gibson assembly (GA) of viral genomic cDNA fragments was tested for its use as a quick and simple method to recover infectious PRRSV in cell culture. GA involves the activities of T5-exonuclease, Phusion polymerase, and Taq ligase to join overlapping cDNA fragments in an isothermal condition. Four overlapping cDNA fragments covering the entire PRRSV genome and one vector fragment were used to create a plasmid capable of expressing the PRRSV genome. The assembled product was used to transfect a co-culture of 293T and MARC-145 cells. Supernatants from the transfected cells were then passaged onto MARC-145 cells to rescue infectious virus particles. Verification and characterization of the recovered virus confirmed that the GA protocol generated infectious PRRSV that had similar characteristics to the parental virus. This approach was then tested for the generation of a chimeric virus. By replacing one of the four genomic fragments with that of another virus strain, a chimeric virus was successfully recovered via GA. In conclusion, this study describes for the first time the use of GA as a simple, yet powerful tool for generating infectious PRRSV needed for studying PRRSV biology and developing novel vaccines.","publish_time":"2015-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suhardiman, Maman; Kramyu, Jarin; Narkpuk, Jaraspim; Jongkaewwattana, Anan; Wanasen, Nanchaya","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28d8b1120bb5474d30ab4d70c85e6f84ed5c6fc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114486.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003955; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300804/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","GA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious PRRSV","PRRSV biology","recovered virus","chimeric virus","entire PRRSV genome","infectious virus particles","virus strain","parental virus","better control PRRSV infection","respiratory syndrome virus","overlapping cDNA fragments","genomic fragments","use of GA","viral genomic cDNA fragments","GA protocol","MARC","transfected cells","respiratory illness","novel approaches","reproductive complications","simple method","novel vaccines","control measures","co-culture","cell culture","Taq ligase","Phusion polymerase","weak immunity","similar characteristics","swine disease","exonuclease","activities of T5","vector fragment","causative agent","powerful tool","isothermal condition","secondary infections","Gibson assembly","plasmid capable","pig industry","time","generation","Verification","characterization","study","Supernatants","assembled product","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

While much of the focus is on respiratory infections, there is substantial evidence that certain pathogens, such as those which colonise the skin, can be released into, and transported through the air through routine activities. In these situations the bacteria is released over a volume of space, with different intensities and locations varying in time rather than being released at a single point. This paper considers the application of CFD modelling to the evaluation of risk from this type of bioaerosol generation. An experimental validation study provides a direct comparison between CFD simulations and bioaerosol distribution, showing that passive scalar and particle tracking approaches are both appropriate for small particle bioaerosols. The study introduces a zonal source, which aims to represent the time averaged release of bacteria from an activity within a zone around the entire location the release takes place. This approach is shown to perform well when validated numerically though comparison with the time averaged dispersion patterns from a transient source. However, the ability of a point source to represent such dispersion is dependent on airflow regime. The applicability of the model is demonstrated using a simulation of an isolation room representing the release of bacteria from bedmaking.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hathway, E.

Although human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) are the natural host for HRV infections, much of our understanding of how HRV replicates and induces host antiviral responses is based on studies using non-airway cell lines (e.g. HeLa cells). The current study examines the replication cycle of HRV, and host cell responses, in highly differentiated cultures of HBE. METHODS: Highly differentiated cultures of HBE were exposed to initial infectious doses ranging from 10(4) to 10(1) 50% tissue culture-infective dose (TCID(50)) of purified HRV-16, and responses were monitored up to 144 h after infection. Viral genomic RNA and negative strand RNA template levels were monitored, along with levels of type I and II interferons and selected antivirals. RESULTS: Regardless of initial infectious dose, relatively constant levels of both genomic and negative strand RNA are generated during replication, with negative strand copy numbers being10,000-fold lower than those of genomic strands. Infections were limited to a small percentage of ciliated cells and did not result in any overt signs of epithelial death. Importantly, regardless of infectious dose, HRV-16 infections were cleared by HBE in the absence of immune cells. Levels of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) varied with initial infectious dose, implying that factors other than levels of double-stranded RNA regulate IFN induction, but the time-course of HRV-16 clearance HBE was the same regardless of levels of IFNs produced. Patterns of antiviral viperin and ISG15 expression suggest they may be generated in an IFN-independent manner during HRV-16 infections. CONCLUSIONS: These data challenge a number of aspects of dogma generated from studies in HeLa cells and emphasize the importance of appropriate cell context when studying HRV infections.","publish_time":"2019-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warner, Stephanie M.; Wiehler, Shahina; Michi, Aubrey N.; Proud, David","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0bd429ecee8c353025af075ab372a8a40874cec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6626354.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-019-1120-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299975/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["HRV","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV infections","HRV replicates","purified HRV","levels of type","replication cycle of HRV","levels of IFNs","levels of double","constant levels","HeLa cells","negative strand RNA template levels","host cell responses","differentiated cultures of HBE","clearance HBE","Viral genomic RNA","host antiviral responses","initial infectious doses","stranded RNA","human bronchial epithelial cells","absence of immune cells","studies","natural host","interferons","small percentage of ciliated cells","genomic strands","negative strand copy numbers being10","non-airway cell lines","exacerbations of lower airway diseases","tissue culture-infective dose","importance of appropriate cell context","IFN induction","Human rhinovirus","Patterns of antiviral viperin","IFN-independent manner","chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases","overt signs of epithelial death","asthma","major trigger","TCID","dogma","primary cause","factors","time-course","number of aspects","ISG15 expression","understanding","current study","data","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","selected antivirals","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

However it is ethically controversial and discouraged by professional guidelines. We conducted this study to investigate the outcomes and trends of overseas kidney and liver transplantation in Taiwan to provide a sound basis for ethical reflection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database was used to identify 2381 domestic and 2518 overseas kidney transplant (KT) recipients from 1998 to 2009 and 1758 domestic and 540 overseas liver transplantation (LT) recipients from 1999 to 2009. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risks of mortality and graft failure. The numbers of overseas transplantation increased after 2000, reached a peak in 2005 and decreased after 2007. Compared to their domestic counterparts, the overseas KT recipients were older, male predominant, with shorter pre-op dialysis period and more comorbidities. Similarly, the overseas LT recipients were older, male predominant and had more hepatocellular carcinoma cases. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year patient survival rates were 96.9%, 91.7% and 83.0% respectively for domestic KT and 95.8%, 87.8% and 73.1% for overseas KT (p\u003C0.001). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year patient survival rates were 89.2%, 79.5%, 75.2% for domestic LT and 79.8%, 54.7%, 49.9% for overseas LT (p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSION: The poorer outcomes of the overseas groups may be due to more older patients, more comorbidities (KT), or more hepatocellular carcinoma recurrences (LT). After domestic reform and international ethical challenges, the numbers of organ tourism decreased but the practice still persisted surreptitiously. Compulsory registration policies for overseas transplantation with international conventions to sanction organ trafficking and transplant tourism should be considered to stop these controversial practices.","publish_time":"2017-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Daniel Fu-Chang; Huang, Shi-Wei; Holm, Soren; Lin, Yi-Ping; Chang, Yu-Kang; Hsu, Chih-Cheng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f19f2b01d3520c10962617e9f078ff9a5a850c88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5456093.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28575014/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178569","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Insurance Research Database"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["overseas KT recipients","overseas LT recipients","overseas groups","domestic KT","domestic LT","overseas liver transplantation","numbers of overseas transplantation","overseas kidney transplant","trends of overseas kidney","domestic reform","domestic counterparts","Transplant tourism","numbers of organ tourism","organ trafficking","older patients","comorbidities","year patient survival rates","international ethical challenges","hepatocellular carcinoma cases","hepatocellular carcinoma recurrences","world organ transplants","international conventions","ethical reflection","poorer outcomes","controversial practices","shorter pre-op dialysis period","Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database","FINDINGS","Compulsory registration policies","sound basis","risks of mortality","Cox proportional hazards models","accounting","graft failure","METHODS","decades","professional guidelines","CONCLUSION","study","BACKGROUND","peak"],"language":"en"},

Recurrent infections and the emergence of resistant viral strains reinforce the need of searching new drugs to treat herpes virus infections. Cardiac glycosides are used clinically to treat cardiovascular disturbances, such as congestive heart failure and atrial arrhythmias. In recent years, they have sparked new interest in their potential anti-herpes action. It has been previously reported by our research group that two new semisynthetic cardenolides, namely C10 (3\u03B2-[(N-(2-hydroxyethyl)aminoacetyl]amino-3-deoxydigitoxigenin) and C11 (3\u03B2-(hydroxyacetyl)amino-3-deoxydigitoxigenin), exhibited potential anti-HSV-1 and anti-HSV-2 with selectivity index values \u003E 1,000, comparable with those of acyclovir. This work reports the mechanism investigation of anti-herpes action of these derivatives. The results demonstrated that C10 and C11 interfere with the intermediate and final steps of HSV replication, but not with the early stages, since they completely abolished the expression of the UL42 (\u03B2) and gD (\u03B3) proteins and partially reduced that of ICP27 (\u03B1). Additionally, they were not virucidal and had no prophylactic effects. Both compounds inhibited HSV replication at nanomolar concentrations, but cardenolide C10 was more active than C11 and can be considered as an anti-herpes drug candidate including against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strains.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boff, Laurita; Schneider, Naira Fernanda Zanchett; Munkert, Jennifer; Ottoni, Flaviano Melo; Ramos, Gabriela Silva; Kreis, Wolfgang; Braga, Fern\u00E3o Castro; Alves, Ricardo Jos\u00E9; de P\u00E1dua, Rodrigo Maia; Sim\u00F5es, Cl\u00E1udia Maria Oliveira","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63a9f00737727183b0af12eece75fad64e9d0899.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188521.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346764/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04562-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential anti-HSV","potential anti-herpes action","acyclovir-resistant HSV","C11","anti-herpes drug candidate","mechanism investigation of anti-herpes action","herpes virus infections","final steps of HSV replication","new drugs","cardenolide C10","deoxydigitoxigenin","new semisynthetic cardenolides","emergence of resistant viral strains","Recurrent infections","nanomolar concentrations","congestive heart failure","need","selectivity index values","cardiovascular disturbances","atrial arrhythmias","gD","research group","compounds","hydroxyacetyl","important public health issue","prevalent pathogens","proteins","hydroxyethyl","UL42","aminoacetyl","work","derivatives","Human herpesviruses","virucidal","prophylactic effects","ICP27","expression","recent years","results","Cardiac glycosides","early stages"],"language":"en"},

However, the risk of death for RSV infection has been rarely evaluated with confounders or comorbidities adjusted. We aimed to evaluate whether RSV infection is associated with higher mortality than seasonal influenza after adjusting for confounders and comorbidities and the effect of oseltamivir on the mortality in patients with influenza infection. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on adult (\u226518 years) patients admitted to the emergency department and ward of a university teaching hospital for suspected viral infection during 2013\u20132015 (N = 3743). RSV infection was diagnosed by multiplex PCR (N = 87). Adults hospitalized for seasonal influenza during the study period were enrolled as a comparison group (n = 312). The main outcome was 20-day all-cause mortality.We used Cox proportional hazard regression analyses to calculate the relative risk of death. RESULTS: Adult patients were less likely to be diagnosed with RSV than with influenza (2.3 vs 8.3%, respectively), were older and more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypoxemia, and bacterial co-infection. In patients with RSV infection, the 20-day all-cause mortality was higher than that for influenza, (18.4 vs 6.7%, respectively). RSV infection showed significantly higher risk of death compared to the seasonal influenza group, with hazard ratio, 2.32 (95% CI, 1.17\u20134.58). Oseltamivir had no significant effect on mortality in patients with influenza. CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection was significantly associated with a higher risk of death than seasonal influenza, adjusted for potential confounders and comorbidities.","publish_time":"2017-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwon, Yong Shik; Park, Sun Hyo; Kim, Mi-Ae; Kim, Hyun Jung; Park, Jae Seok; Lee, Mi Young; Lee, Choong Won; Dauti, Sonila; Choi, Won-Il","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a016307c6c178384d6819b68cab3b1045486b9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5738863.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29262784/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-017-2897-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza infection","RSV infection","seasonal influenza group","higher mortality","suspected viral infection","bacterial co-infection","higher risk of death","Adult patients","relative risk of death","comorbidities","day all-cause mortality","effect of oseltamivir","potential confounders","vs","hazard ratio","study period","significant effect","comparison group","substantial disease burden","retrospective cohort study","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Cox proportional hazard regression analyses","university teaching hospital","hypoxemia","ward","pneumonia","emergency department","Respiratory syncytial virus","general population","BACKGROUND","multiplex PCR","main outcome","METHODS","years","RESULTS","Adults","CONCLUSIONS","CI"],"language":"en"},

PLpro acts as a protease and processes the large coronavirus polyprotein for virus replication. PLpro also functions as both a deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating (deISG) enzyme and removes ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins. Both DUB and deISG activities are implicated in suppressing innate immune responses; however, the precise role of each activity in this process is still unclear due in part to the difficulties in separating each activity. In this study, we determine the first structure of MERS PLpro in complex with the full-length human ISG15 to a resolution of 2.3 \u00C5. This structure and available structures of MERS PLpro-Ub complexes were used as molecular guides to design PLpro mutants that lack either or both DUB/deISG activities. We tested 13 different PLpro mutants for protease, DUB, and deISG activitites using fluorescence-based assays. Results show that we can selectively modulate DUB activity at amino acid positions 1649 and 1653 while mutation of Val1691 or His1652 of PLpro to a positive charged residue completely impairs both DUB/deISG activities. These mutant enzymes will provide new functional tools for delineating the importance of DUB versus deISG activity in virus-infected cells and may serve as potential candidates for attenuating the MERS virus in vivo for modified vaccine design efforts.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clasman, Jozlyn R.; Everett, Renata K.; Srinivasan, Karthik; Mesecar, Andrew D.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90c0bd799a1e2db115c04aa6fffa55939558027c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114298.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635421930436X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635421930436X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31765674/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104661","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["DUB activity","deISG activity","deISG activities","structure of MERS PLpro","His1652 of PLpro","PLpro acts","MERS virus","importance of DUB","design PLpro mutants","different PLpro mutants","deISG activitites","available structures of MERS PLpro-Ub complexes","virus replication","virus-infected cells","multiple enzymatic activities","full-length human ISG15","large coronavirus polyprotein","Abstract Coronavirus papain","modified vaccine design efforts","infectious Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","molecular guides","new functional tools","proteases","positive charged residue","interferon-stimulated gene","amino acid positions","potential candidates","fluorescence-based assays","mutant enzymes","genome","precise role","viral infection","innate immune responses","resolution","mutation of Val1691","ubiquitin","PLPs","deISGylating","process","cellular proteins","difficulties","study","Results"],"language":"en"},

As an indispensable part of TCM, Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) are highly valued and critically acclaimed in their campaign to contain and tackle the epidemic, they can achieve considerable effects for both suspected cases under medical observation period, and confirmed individuals with serious underlying diseases or critical conditions. Given this, based on the Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China, the present review summarized the basic information, clinical evidence and published literatures of recommended CPMs against COVID-19.

METHODS: A survey conducted in 21 intensive care units in 17 provinces in China. RESULTS: Out of 733 questionnaires distributed, 695 were completed. Three hundred and fifty-six respondents (51.2%) reported their experience of caring for H1N1 patients. Despite the fact that 88.5% of all respondents ultimately finished an H1N1 training program, only 41.9% admitted that they had the knowledge of 2009 H1N1 influenza. A total of 572 respondents (82.3%) expressed willingness to care for H1N1 patients. Independent variables associated with increasing likelihood to care for patients in the logistic regression analysis were physicians or nurses rather than other professionals (odds ratio 4.056 and 3.235, p = 0.002 and 0.007, respectively), knowledge training prior to patient care (odds ratio 1.531, p = 0.044), and the confidence to know how to protect themselves and their patients (odds ratio 2.109, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Critical care clinicians reported poor knowledge of H1N1 influenza, even though most finished a relevant knowledge training program.

Abstract The characteristics of pandemic influenza 2009 differ from those of seasonal influenza. In Australia-New Zealand the number of admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) increased by 15-fold in the southern winter. We compared the characteristics of the Spanish series of the first ICU admissions in July with those of series published in Canada and Australia-New Zealand up to October 2009. Unlike the situation in Spain, only half the admissions in Canada and Australia-New Zealand were due to primary viral pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia was much more frequent. In all series, young people, many of whom had no comborbidities, were the most frequently affected population. The most common comorbidities were obesity, chronic pulmonary disease, pregnancy and heart disease. Diagnosis through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction can have a false-negative rate of 10%. Shock and acute renal insufficiency were more frequent in the Spanish series. A total of 10-30% of patients required ICU admission and 6 of 10 patients required mechanical ventilation with a high frequency of failure of non-invasive ventilation (75%). Mortality was similar among the series (14-25%) but was higher in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (30%). Early oseltamivir administration (\u003C 48h after symptom onset) has been associated with better outcome. Therefore, early administration of this drug in patients with risk factors or those who, although free from risk factors, show clinical progression, could reduce ICU admissions and mortality.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodr\u00EDguez, Alejandro; Lisboa, Thiago; Rello, Jordi","journal":"Archivos de Bronconeumolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/541033a6c493c16923ce0a6a68141041493ec037.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030028961070017X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030028961070017X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UCI","serie espa\u00F1ola"],"locations":["Australia","Nueva Zelanda","Espa\u00F1a","Spain","Canada","Canad\u00E1"],"keyphrases":["total of","In Australia","frequent in the Spanish series","We compared the characteristics of the Spanish series of the first ICU admissions in July with those of series published in Canada and Australia","New Zealand the number of admissions","In all series","early administration of","Abstract The characteristics of pandemic influenza","negative rate of","The most common","Unlike the situation in Spain","fold in the southern winter","of patients required ICU admission and","only half the admissions in Canada and Australia","Mortality was similar among the series","series publicadas","patients required mechanical ventilation with a high frequency of failure of non","many of whom had","the intensive care unit","ICU admissions and mortality","differ from those of seasonal influenza","were the most frequently affected population","but was higher in patients requiring mechanical ventilation","drug in patients with risk factors or those who","ANZIC","ingreso a UCI","New Zealand were due","Shock and acute renal insufficiency were","pregnancy and heart","were obesity","primeros ingresos","New Zealand up","invasive ventilation","serie espa\u00F1ola","Canad\u00E1","VM","pacientes","administraci\u00F3n precoz","caracter\u00EDsticas","mortalidad","primary viral pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia was much","neumon\u00EDa viral primaria","Early oseltamivir administration","although free from risk factors","been associated with better outcome","h de inicio","neumon\u00EDa bacteriana","ventilaci\u00F3n mec\u00E1nica","gripe pand\u00E9mica","gripe estacional","insuficiencia renal aguda","h after symptom onset","show clinical progression","increased by","could","young people","chronic pulmonary","chain reaction can have","embarazo","patolog\u00EDa pulmonar cr\u00F3nica","unidad de cuidados intensivos","cardiopat\u00EDa","alta frecuencia de fracaso","mitad","Therefore","October","factores de riesgo","Espa\u00F1a","obesidad","comorbilidades","Nueva Zelanda","signos de progresi\u00F3n cl\u00EDnica","Diagnosis through","invierno austral","poblaci\u00F3n","diagn\u00F3stico","PCR","diferencia","s\u00EDntomas","falsos negativos","mejor evoluci\u00F3n","j\u00F3venes"],"language":"es"},

As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the host\u2013virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, we debate the need for a model for staging COVID-19 based on neurological tissue involvement.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baig, Abdul Mannan; Khaleeq, Areeba; Ali, Usman; Syeda, Hira","journal":"ACS Chem Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd5d460f62f8e1c421c50eb0b9df0271a9b675cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094171.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167747/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00122","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["staging COVID","expression of ACE2","neurological tissue involvement","ongoing pandemic of COVID","SARS-CoV","expression levels of ACE2","possible contribution of neurological tissue damage","recent outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease","recent cases","virus interaction","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","CNS","morbidity","potential","receptor","mortality","enzyme","host","text","angiotensin","scare of epic proportion","complications","pathogenesis","entry","midst","need","model","density","transcriptomic level","apprehension","cells","COIVD","Image","short time","scientists","curiosity","world","humans"],"language":"en"},

The underlying mechanism on SAON was evaluated using a well-established quadrupedal rabbit model. Fifteen emus were established with SAON, and CD was performed along the femoral neck for the efficacy study. In this CD bone defect, a P/T scaffold with icaritin (P/T/I group) or without icaritin (P/T group) was implanted while no scaffold implantation was used as a control. For the mechanistic study in rabbits, the effects of icaritin and composite scaffolds on bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) recruitment, osteogenesis, and anti-adipogenesis were evaluated. Our efficacy study showed that P/T/I group had the significantly lowest incidence of femoral head collapse, better preserved cartilage and mechanical properties supported by more new bone formation within the bone tunnel. For the mechanistic study, our in vitro tests suggested that icaritin enhanced the expression of osteogenesis related genes COL1\u03B1, osteocalcin, RUNX2, and BMP-2 while inhibited adipogenesis related genes C/EBP-\u00DF, PPAR-\u03B3, and aP2 of rabbit BMSCs. Both P/T and P/T/I scaffolds were demonstrated to recruit BMSCs both in vitro and in vivo but a higher expression of migration related gene VCAM1 was only found in P/T/I group in vitro. In conclusion, both efficacy and mechanistic studies show the potential of a bioactive composite porous P/T scaffold incorporating icaritin to enhance bone defect repair after surgical CD and prevent femoral head collapse in a bipedal SAON emu model.","publish_time":"2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qin, Ling; Yao, Dong; Zheng, Lizhen; Liu, Wai-Ching; Liu, Zhong; Lei, Ming; Huang, Le; Xie, Xinhui; Wang, Xinluan; Chen, Yang; Yao, Xinsheng; Peng, Jiang; Gong, He; Griffith, James F.; Huang, Yanping; Zheng, Yongping; Feng, Jian Q.; Liu, Ying; Chen, Shihui; Xiao, Deming; Wang, Daping; Xiong, Jiangyi; Pei, Duanqing; Zhang, Peng; Pan, Xiaohua; Wang, Xiaohong; Lee, Kwong-Man; Cheng, Chun-Yiu","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e977b54f5d3d4141b92d5cd273fbdf77c125fba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111223.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.04.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961215004135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25968462/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961215004135","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["P/T","SAON"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T scaffold","T group","CD bone defect","bone tunnel","effects of icaritin","efficacy study","mechanistic study","bone defect repair","bone defect filler","bioactive composite porous P","joint collapse","surgical CD","bipedal SAON emu model","bipedal SAON animal model","new bone formation","sustained release of icaritin","lowest incidence of femoral head collapse","femoral neck","scaffold implantation","bone mesenchymal stem cells","expression of osteogenesis related genes COL1\u03B1","composite scaffolds","mechanistic studies","aP2 of rabbit BMSCs","inhibited adipogenesis related genes C","well-established quadrupedal rabbit model","higher expression of migration related gene VCAM1","anti-adipogenesis","surgical core-decompression","subsequent joint replacement","better preserved cartilage","EBP-\u00DF","mechanical properties","recruitment","tricalcium phosphate","potential","osteocalcin","Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid","PPAR-\u03B3","metabolite of Epimedium","BMP","RUNX2","large flightless bird","rabbits","tests","derived flavonoids","Steroid-associated osteonecrosis","conclusion","control","underlying mechanism","emus"],"language":"en"},

Both viruses can infect a broad range of mammalian species causing severe and often-lethal disease in humans and animals, and repeated outbreaks continue to occur. Extensive laboratory studies on the host cell infection stage of HeV and NiV and the roles of their envelope glycoproteins have been hampered by their highly pathogenic nature and restriction to biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a henipavirus envelope glycoprotein pseudotyped lentivirus assay system using either a luciferase gene or green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene encoding human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) genome in conjunction with the HeV and NiV fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins. RESULTS: Functional retrovirus particles pseudotyped with henipavirus F and G glycoproteins displayed proper target cell tropism and entry and infection was dependent on the presence of the HeV and NiV receptors ephrinB2 or B3 on target cells. The functional specificity of the assay was confirmed by the lack of reporter-gene signals when particles bearing either only the F or only G glycoprotein were prepared and assayed. Virus entry could be specifically blocked when infection was carried out in the presence of a fusion inhibiting C-terminal heptad (HR-2) peptide, a well-characterized, cross-reactive, neutralizing human mAb specific for the henipavirus G glycoprotein, and soluble ephrinB2 and B3 receptors. In addition, the utility of the assay was also demonstrated by an examination of the influence of the cytoplasmic tail of F in its fusion activity and incorporation into pseudotyped virus particles by generating and testing a panel of truncation mutants of NiV and HeV F. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results demonstrate that a specific henipavirus entry assay has been developed using NiV or HeV F and G glycoprotein pseudotyped reporter-gene encoding retrovirus particles. This assay can be conducted safely under BSL-2 conditions and will be a useful tool for measuring henipavirus entry and studying F and G glycoprotein function in the context of virus entry, as well as in assaying and characterizing neutralizing antibodies and virus entry inhibitors.","publish_time":"2010-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khetawat, Dimple; Broder, Christopher C","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e806597d3525be5b55b7bd8812217c2e53bced9f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2994542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21073718/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-312","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["HeV F","henipavirus F","henipavirus G glycoprotein","pseudotyped virus particles","specific henipavirus entry assay","context of virus entry","virus entry inhibitors","NiV fusion","G glycoproteins","G glycoprotein pseudotyped reporter-gene","G glycoprotein function","Nipah virus","Hendra virus","henipavirus envelope glycoprotein pseudotyped lentivirus assay system","NiV receptors ephrinB2","human immunodeficiency virus type","cytoplasmic tail of F","new Henipavirus genus","Functional retrovirus particles","host cell infection stage of HeV","luciferase gene","gene signals","envelope glycoproteins","panel of truncation mutants of NiV","fusion activity","B3 receptors","presence","RESULTS","BSL","human mAb specific","proper target cell tropism","soluble ephrinB2","target cells","lack of reporter","repeated outbreaks","neutralizing antibodies","functional specificity","fusion inhibiting C-terminal heptad","GFP","green fluorescent protein","incorporation","peptide","biosafety level","humans","animals","Queensland","Extensive laboratory studies","HIV","emerged zoonotic paramyxoviruses","broad range of mammalian species","conjunction","attachment","lethal disease","pathogenic nature","restriction","Australia","influence","useful tool","CONCLUSIONS","assaying","roles","conditions","examination","genome","BACKGROUND","peninsular Malaysia","addition","utility","containment","problem"],"language":"en"},

Calibrated to phylogenetic linkages of virus genomes, these spatial models provide unique insight into the disease mobility of EBOV in Sierra Leone without the need for human mobility data. Consistent with other investigations, our results show that the spread of EBOV during the beginning and middle portions of the epidemic strongly depended on the size of and distance between populations. Our phylodynamic analysis also revealed a change in model preference towards a spatial model with power-law characteristics in the latter portion of the epidemic, correlated with the timing of major intervention campaigns.

Case-fatality rates are as high as 50% and there are no approved vaccines or specific therapies for infection. Our laboratory has recently developed a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine that expressed the glycoproteins of Andes virus in place of the native VSV glycoprotein (G). This vaccine is highly efficacious in the Syrian hamster model of HCPS when given 28 days before challenge with ANDV, or when given around the time of challenge (peri-exposure), and even protects when administered post-exposure. Herein, we sought to test the durability of the immune response to a single dose of this vaccine in Syrian hamsters. This vaccine was efficacious in hamsters challenged intranasally with ANDV 6 months after vaccination (p = 0.025), but animals were not significantly protected following 1 year of vaccination (p = 0.090). The decrease in protection correlated with a reduction of measurable neutralizing antibody responses, and suggests that a more robust vaccination schedule might be required to provide long-term immunity.","publish_time":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prescott, Joseph; DeBuysscher, Blair L.; Brown, Kyle S.; Feldmann, Heinz","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22977df2b5a35dfe536faa4bd77a21ab316dc9f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3939469.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v6020516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492621/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV","HCPS","ANDV"],"locations":["South America"],"keyphrases":["ANDV","based vaccine","glycoproteins of Andes virus","Syrian hamsters","year of vaccination","robust vaccination schedule","Syrian hamster model of HCPS","time of challenge","peri-exposure","post-exposure","replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus","native VSV glycoprotein","primary etiologic agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome","place","single dose","humans","reduction of measurable neutralizing antibody responses","approved vaccines","specific therapies","infection","immune response","days","months","South America","Case-fatality rates","protection","durability","decrease","long-term immunity","laboratory","animals"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to identify the crucial domain of the S1 subunit of the S protein that interacts with NCAM. METHODS: Three truncated segments (S(1-291), S(277-794) and S(548-868)) of the S gene of PHEV and the NCAM gene were cloned individually into the Escherichia coli expression vectors and yeast two-hybrid expression vectors. The interaction between S(1-291), S(277-794), S(548-868) and NCAM were detected by a GST pull-down experiment and yeast two-hybrid assay. RESULTS: Three fusion proteins (S(1-291), S(277-794) and S(548-868)) were screened for their interactions with NCAM by protein-protein interaction assays. The results of these assays clarified that S(277-794) interacted with NCAM, while S(1-291) and S(548-868) did not. CONCLUSIONS: A small fragment (258-amino-acid fragment, residues 291-548) on the PHEV S protein was posited to be the minimum number of amino acids necessary to interact with NCAM. This fragment may be the receptor-binding domain that mediates PHEV binding to NCAM.","publish_time":"2015-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Bo; Gao, Wei; Lu, Huijun; Zhao, Kui; Ding, Ning; Liu, Wenfeng; Zhao, Jiakuan; Lan, Yungang; Tang, Bo; Jin, Zhao; He, Wenqi; Gao, Feng","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ceaf1ce77440c43549de7a989c28376495b57e61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179542.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000381060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25925196/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCAM","PHEV","GST","PHEV S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PHEV S protein","S gene of PHEV","NCAM gene","PHEV binding","protein-protein interaction assays","yeast","receptor-binding domain","hybrid expression vectors","amino-acid fragment","small fragment","RESULTS","protein of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","Escherichia coli expression vectors","crucial domain","hybrid assay","minimum number of amino acids necessary","cellular neural cell adhesion molecule","infection","S1 subunit","GST pull-down experiment","spike","residues","METHODS","truncated segments","fusion proteins","interactions","study","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.","publish_time":"2020-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, Zi-Wei; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yuen, Kit-San; Fung, Sin-Yee; Chan, Chi-Ping; Jin, Dong-Yan","journal":"Int J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd1973693386dff5704ca4460874257cb1f037dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7098031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226286/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45472","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","China"],"keyphrases":["different HCoVs","zoonotic origins of HCoVs","sister SARS-CoV","CoV pathogenesis","human CoVs","CoV-host interactions","current CoV disease","implications of virus evolution","perspective of virus evolution","emergence of SARS","animal hosts","human beings","HCoV infection","co-evolution of coronaviruses","prevention of human diseases","intermediate reservoir hosts","direct implications","Middle East respiratory syndrome","disease severity","outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome","successful host switches","important insight","reduced pathogenicity","MERS","animals","requirements","discovery","humans","genome recombination","COVID","zoonosis","mild illness","central China","overview","high transmissibility","coin","addition","end","thousands of years","adaptation","interspecies transmission","focus","existing knowledge","epidemic","history","Mutation","bats","context","review","spotlight"],"language":"en"},

These works testify to the students\u0027 ability to analyze the consequences of an exceptional pandemic situation and their reflexive capacities.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mauduit, Laurence; Ferring, Vincent","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6de88d3372bcb0a2a68d4a19ddf7e7aef79b3d0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1779012320301753?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1779012320301753","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the confinement","the sociological","with the human","explaining the links","ability to analyze the consequences","These works testify to the students","Abstract After the beginning","press article dealing with the consequences","arch\u00E9ologie du confinement","d\u00E9but du confinement","capacit\u00E9 des \u00E9tudiants","physiotherapy to select","an exceptional pandemic situation","article scientifique","social sciences","sciences humaines","analyse des cons\u00E9quences","travaux pertinents","we asked first year students","justifying their choice","their reflexive capacities","situation pand\u00E9mique exceptionnelle","rich work that could constitute an archaeology","scientific","psychological","educational","th\u00E9matiques sociologiques","liens effectu\u00E9s","philosophical themes treated","kin\u00E9sith\u00E9rapie","premi\u00E8re ann\u00E9e","masso","capacit\u00E9s r\u00E9flexives","presse","choix","R\u00E9sum\u00E9"],"language":"fr"},

The first cases were noted as a cluster of patients with pneumonia who were all linked to a live animal market, and testing found the presence of a previously unknown coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that affect both animals and humans, and several (OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63) are a cause of the common cold.1, 2 However, two coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more severe disease: the SARS coronavirus in 2002\u20132003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012.1, 2 Chinese authorities and researchers should be commended for their rapid sharing of viral sequences which enabled laboratories worldwide to develop diagnostic tests within weeks of discovery of the pathogen.3 An Australian laboratory subsequently isolated the virus from a clinical sample (the first to do so outside of China), and rapidly shared this virus with relevant global agencies, further aiding diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine development efforts. Information on the new virus and its impact is being updated constantly. We know that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can cause severe disease, although active surveillance of contacts is required to define the milder end of the disease spectrum and to estimate the true hospitalisation and case fatality ratio. The cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults; it is currently unclear whether comorbidities reflect the age group affected or whether they are risk factors for severe disease.4, 5 Early studies using data before the institution of public health interventions in China suggest that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is as transmissible as SARS coronavirus and probably more transmissible than influenza viruses.6, 7 The timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset is a particularly important parameter with implications for public health control. While reports suggest that asymptomatic infection and transmission may result from minimally symptomatic cases, the contribution of this to transmission is not yet known.8 Careful analysis of early data suggests that the mean incubation period is 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days.9 Reports of large outbreaks, particularly associated with hospitals and closed communities, raise the possibility of \u201Csuperspreading\u201D events, a feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks.10 The importance of infection control is also reinforced by a report that 41% of cases in Wuhan were acquired nosocomially (including 40 health care workers and 17 patients).4 As at 26 February 2020, there were 23 confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 in Australia, across five jurisdictions. Although reported case numbers in China are slowing, large outbreaks on a cruise ship in Japan, and in South Korea, Iran and Italy are concerning and highlight our interconnected world. However, it is likely that this will change in the days or weeks ahead. Although absolute case numbers are small in Australia, the public health, political and societal ramifications have already been considerable, ranging from travel restrictions on non\u2010Australians coming from China, the use of offshore and remote quarantine facilities, and disturbing reports of racism against members of our Asian community (https://insig\u200Bhtplus.mja.com.au/2020/5/coron\u200Bavirus-no-place-for-racism-xenop\u200Bhobia/).","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Allen C; Williamson, Deborah A","journal":"The Medical journal of Australia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32146721/; https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.50530","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hubei","China","Middle East","Australia","South Korea","Iran"],"keyphrases":["coronavirus disease","SARS coronavirus","severe disease","novel coronavirus","unknown coronavirus","feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","public health control","disease spectrum","Reports of large outbreaks","central China","days","symptomatic cases","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","confirmed cases of COVID","significant outbreaks","reported case numbers","institution of public health interventions","health care workers","absolute case numbers","group of viruses","new virus","transmission","Coronaviruses","cause","disturbing reports of racism","case fatality ratio","importance of infection control","aiding diagnostic","diagnostic tests","Early studies","Careful analysis of early data","influenza viruses","age group","weeks of discovery","city of Wuhan","asymptomatic infection","cluster of patients","important parameter","remote quarantine facilities","symptom onset","use of offshore","true hospitalisation","relevant global agencies","timing of infectiousness relative","laboratories","members","Japan","events","Hubei province","societal ramifications","implications","vaccine development efforts","mean incubation period","South Korea","travel restrictions","non\u2010Australians","cruise ship","Italy","testing","possibility","rapid sharing of viral sequences","HKU1","pathogen","presence","hospitals","active surveillance of contacts","risk factors","milder end","Chinese authorities","live animal market","OC43","closed communities","older adults","researchers","Iran","Asian community","superspreading","NL63","humans","comorbidities","Australian laboratory","animals","date","contribution","coron\u200Bavirus","place-fo","pneumonia","clinical sample","Information","impact","range","interconnected world","jurisdictions"],"language":"en"},

Though these two viral spikes were both expressed, each associated independently with Gag and gave rise to two distinct virion populations, each with a spike of a single type. Confocal imaging demonstrated that HIV Env(89.6) and Ebola GP localized to distinct lipid raft microdomains within the same cell, where each associated with distinct Gag particles. Similar Env localization was observed in HIV-infected T cells, where ~14 percent of Env was associated with Gag during productive infection.

Strain H165 has been proven to be safe in piglets and pregnant sows and displays efficacy against TGEV infection. In this study, we report the complete genome sequences of strains H165 and H16, obtained by sequencing several overlapping fragments amplified from viral RNA and our findings from sequence and phylogenetic analyses. The genomes were 28,569 nucleotides in length, including the poly (A) tail. No deletions or insertions were detected in the H16 genome sequence after continuous passage in vitro; however, we found 27 nucleotide mutations in strain H165 compared with strain H16, resulting in 16 amino acid changes distributed among the genes 1, S, 3, and sM. An A to G nucleotide mutation was found in the intergenic region between the 3a and 3b genes. Furthermore, six unique nucleotides identified in the genome sequence of H165 could be used as makers to differentiate the H165 vaccine strain from wild-type TGEV strains. Our findings from phylogenetic analysis may enhance our understanding of the evolution of TGEV, as well as the other coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2010-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chengbao; Chen, Jianfei; Shi, Hongyan; Qiu, Huaji; Xue, Fei; Liu, Changming; Zhu, Yuanmao; Liu, Shengwang; Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando; Enjuanes, Luis; Feng, Li","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22060d8bc544aa2b2d5ed5e85159ee62410b139e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088588.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20229183/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-010-0467-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H165 vaccine strain","Chinese vaccine strain H165 of TGEV","genome sequence of H165","H16 genome sequence","virulent field strain H16","TGEV infection","evolution of TGEV","complete genome sequences of strains H165","wild-type TGEV strains","findings","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","swine neonates","viral RNA","swine industry","serial passage","continuous passage","etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis","nucleotide mutations","phylogenetic analysis","phylogenetic analyses","unique nucleotides","b genes","G nucleotide mutation","major cause of viral enteritis","fetal diarrhea","significant economic losses","pregnant sows","efficacy","piglets","amino acid changes","understanding","makers","overlapping fragments","poly","length","insertions","intergenic region","genomes","study","tail","deletions","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

The results show that the isomer \u03B1-1,2 is superior to other isomers as a potential inhibitor to neuraminidase. The positively charged arginine residues around the active site of NA could be induced by negatively charged POM to adapt themselves and could form salt bridge interactions and hydrogen bond interactions with POM. The binding free energies of POM/NA complexes range from \u22125.36 to \u22128.31 kcal mol(\u22121). The electrostatic interactions are found to be the driving force during the binding process of POM to NA. The conformational analysis shows that POM tends to bind primarily with N1 and N8 at the edge of the active pocket, which causes the conformational change of the pincers structure comprising residue 347 and loop 150. Whereas, the active pockets of N2, N9 and N4 are found to be more spacious, which allows POM to enter into the active pockets directly and anchor there firmly.

Sensing the level and distributions of impurities help in the control of building systems and mitigate long term health risks. Rapid detection of infectious diseases in large public areas like airports and train stations may help limit exposure and aid in reducing the spread of the disease. Complete coverage by sensors to account for any release scenario of chemical or biological warfare agents may provide the opportunity to develop isolation and evacuation plans that mitigate the impact of the attack. All these scenarios involve strategic placement of sensors to promptly detect and rapidly respond. This paper presents a data driven sensor placement algorithm based on a dynamical systems approach. The approach utilizes the finite dimensional Perron-Frobenius (PF) concept. The PF operator (or the Markov matrix) is used to construct an observability gramian that naturally incorporates sensor accuracy, location constraints, and sensing constraints. The algorithm determines the response times, sensor coverage maps, and the number of sensors needed. The utility of the procedure is illustrated using four examples: a literature example of the flow field inside an aircraft cabin and three air flow fields in different geometries. The effect of the constraints on the response times for different sensor placement scenarios is investigated. Knowledge of the response time and coverage of the multiple sensors aides in the design of mechanical systems and response mechanisms. The methodology provides a simple process for place sensors in a building, analyze the sensor coverage maps and response time necessary during extreme events, as well as evaluate indoor air quality. The theory established in this paper also allows for future work in topics related to construction of classical estimator problems for the sensors, real-time contaminant transport, and development of agent dispersion, contaminant isolation/removal, and evacuation strategies.","publish_time":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fontanini, Anthony D.; Vaidya, Umesh; Ganapathysubramanian, Baskar","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f704c5b425905a6a1d4f37cd2663c01c3b82048.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126557.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132316300403; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.02.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287963/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132316300403","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":["Abstract Air","PF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensor coverage maps","response times","place sensors","number of sensors","strategic placement of sensors","sensor accuracy","response mechanisms","different sensor placement scenarios","response time necessary","multiple sensors aides","Complete coverage","sensing constraints","data driven sensor placement algorithm","contaminant isolation","public health","control of building systems","air flow fields","dynamical systems approach","location constraints","indoor air quality","Abstract Air quality","paper","design of mechanical systems","different geometries","evacuation plans","PF operator","evacuation strategies","large public areas","real-time contaminant transport","long term health risks","development of agent dispersion","release scenario of chemical","train stations","airports","opportunity","removal","aircraft cabin","account","important issue","biological warfare agents","construction of classical estimator problems","Rapid detection of infectious diseases","finite dimensional Perron-Frobenius","topics","extreme events","simple process","exposure","literature example","future work","distributions of impurities","spread","examples","methodology","impact","Markov matrix","concept","years","observability gramian","Knowledge","procedure","level","effect","utility","attack","theory"],"language":"en"},

The interaction of chymostatin to Norwalk virus protease was validated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.","publish_time":"2012-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Kyeong-Ok; Takahashi, Daisuke; Prakash, Om; Kim, Yunjeong","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b94d744920dd9f5c6ea3e53b50755919f3fc379.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3259199.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22200497/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682211005599; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682211005599; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.12.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Norwalk virus protease","proteases of Norwalk virus","norovirus protease","GII proteases","virus replication","MD145 virus","G1 norovirus","humans","commercial protease inhibitors","majority of norovirus infections","enzymatic activities","enzymatic activity","interaction of chymostatin","Abstract Noroviruses","fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrates","nuclear magnetic resonance","nonstructural proteins","attractive target","large viral polyprotein","water","open reading frame","major cause of food","ORF","genogroups","similar efficiency","cleavage site","antiviral drug development","high genetic diversity","NMR","spectroscopy","GV","gastroenteritis outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

At present, little is known about how viruses overcome IFITM restriction. In this study, we have utilized HIV-1 as a model and selected IFITM1-resistant viruses after multiple passages of HIV-1 in IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells. Sequencing the entire viral genome revealed several mutations in the vpu and envelope genes, among which mutations Vpu34 and EnvG367E together enable efficient HIV-1 replication in IFITM1-expressing cells. Vpu34 introduces a stop codon at amino acid position 35 of Vpu, whereas EnvG367E changes the G367 residue at the CD4-binding site of gp120. These two mutations do not appear to overcome the downregulation of viral p24 expression caused by IFITM1, but rather enhance HIV-1 replication by promoting cell-to-cell virus transmission. Altogether, our data demonstrate that HIV-1 can mutate to evade IFITM1 restriction by increasing cell-to-cell transmission.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Shilei; Pan, Qinghua; Liu, Shan-Lu; Liang, Chen","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebc43d816d42000ef2dbae52769965bca0a27b33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4274668.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725927/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.01.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682214000336; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682214000336","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFITM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficient HIV","IFITM1 restriction","cell transmission","multiple passages of HIV","cell virus transmission","selected IFITM1-resistant viruses","mutations Vpu34","EnvG367E","replication","IFITM restriction","wide range of viruses","SupT1 cells","entire viral genome","human immunodeficiency virus type","downregulation of viral p24 expression","amino acid position","stop codon","G367 residue","infection","envelope genes","model","CD4-binding site of gp120","proteins","Abstract Interferon","data","study","present"],"language":"en"},

Since its discovery more than 40 years ago, the IL-6 pathway has emerged as a pivotal pathway involved in immune regulation in health and dysregulation in many diseases. Targeting of the IL-6 pathway has led to innovative therapeutic approaches for various rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still\u2019s disease, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, as well as other conditions such as Castleman disease and cytokine release syndrome. Targeting this pathway has also identified avenues for potential expansion into several other indications, such as uveitis, neuromyelitis optica and, most recently, COVID-19 pneumonia. To mark the tenth anniversary of anti-IL-6 receptor therapy worldwide, we discuss the history of research into IL-6 biology and the development of therapies that target IL-6 signalling, including the successes and challenges and with an emphasis on rheumatic diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choy, Ernest H.; De Benedetti, Fabrizio; Takeuchi, Tsutomu; Hashizume, Misato; John, Markus R.; Kishimoto, Tadamitsu","journal":"Nat Rev Rheumatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5dff7bfd64059218ad19e8d7989067dddbfa37fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178926.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-020-0419-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327746/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Castleman"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anniversary of anti-IL","pivotal pathway","various rheumatic diseases","rheumatoid arthritis","Castleman disease","Takayasu arteritis","T cells","B cells","juvenile idiopathic arthritis","giant cell arteritis","adult-onset Still\u2019s disease","innovative therapeutic approaches","antibody production","immune regulation","health","cytokine release syndrome","indications","challenges","dysregulation","conditions","signalling","receptor therapy","biology","emphasis","development of therapies","potential expansion","neuromyelitis optica","uveitis","successes","avenues","history of research","soluble factor","COVID","years","pneumonia","discovery"],"language":"en"},

The results showed that three Japanese type II FCoVs, M91-267, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627, also emerged by homologous recombination between type I FCoV and type II CCoV and their parent viruses were genetically different from one another. In addition, the 3\u2032-terminal recombination sites of M91-267, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627 were different from one another within the genes encoding membrane and spike proteins, and the 5\u2032-terminal recombination sites were also located at different regions of ORF1. These results indicate that at least three Japanese type II FCoVs emerged independently. Sera from a cat experimentally infected with type I FCoV was unable to neutralize type II CCoV infection, indicating that cats persistently infected with type I FCoV may be superinfected with type II CCoV. Our previous study reported that few Japanese cats have antibody against type II FCoV. All of these observations suggest that type II FCoV emerged inside the cat body and is unable to readily spread among cats, indicating that these recombination events for emergence of pathogenic coronaviruses occur frequently.","publish_time":"2014-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Terada, Yutaka; Matsui, Nobutaka; Noguchi, Keita; Kuwata, Ryusei; Shimoda, Hiroshi; Soma, Takehisa; Mochizuki, Masami; Maeda, Ken","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19b9ee3dcd89f01eea3e48b333888b1ce70b296f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4152292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180686/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0106534","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":["KUK-H/L"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Japanese type","FCoVs","recombination events","double recombination","Japanese cats","homologous recombination","terminal recombination sites of M91","CCoV infection","cat body","KUK-H","Tokyo","results","different regions of ORF1","canine coronavirus","feline coronavirus","previous study","genes","emergence of pathogenic coronaviruses","parent viruses","antibody","membrane","spike proteins","CCoVs","observations","addition","Sera"],"language":"en"},

An observational study was performed to determine how rapidly conventional treatment improves airway inflammation in patients admitted to hospital with AECOPD. Methods: Twenty\u2010four consecutive patients with AECOPD were recruited and changes in sputum inflammatory indices were assessed after 2 and 4 days of treatment. The primary end\u2010points included presence of bacteria and viruses, changes in sputum total cell counts (TCC) and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) differential counts, and levels of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), IL\u20108 and TNF\u2010\u03B1. Results: All patients received oral corticosteroids and 17 (71%) were also treated with oral antibiotics. A bacterial or viral pathogen was isolated from 12 patients (50%), and Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from one. A positive bacterial culture was associated with increased sputum TCC and PMN count (P \u003C 0.05), as well as higher levels of IL\u20108 and TNF\u2010\u03B1 (P \u003C 0.05), and a trend towards lower sputum SLPI levels (P = 0.06).

One health approaches \u2013 which combine multidisciplinary efforts to stimulate collaborations between different health professionals such as veterinarians, medical practitioners, biologists, and public health professionals \u2013 can be understood as a response to this complex interconnectedness. Integrating a social science perspective might prove beneficial to this endeavor. This essay locates the one health discussion on disease ecologies in a more than human world within recent developments in cultural and medical anthropology that focus on the entanglements between health and a multitude of animals, plants or microbes, as they are characteristic of a globalized modernity. The paper aims to examine the social dimensions of human\u2013animal-disease-interactions, claiming that disease is a biocultural phenomenon and that social factors generally play a crucial role in the emergence, spread and management of (infectious) disease. Consequently, it will be argued that there is a need to rethink our objects of inquiry and any given assumptions of human health, the human body or the constitution of \u201Cthe global\u201D as such. Incorporating the social sciences into one health approaches can help address topics such as consumption patterns, human\u2013animal behavior or environmental conflicts in a novel way and on a grander scale than ever before. Yet, a greater sensitivity to context may entail some skepticism about the idea of one health \u2013 not in spite of the complex entanglements between humans, environments, animals and pathogens, but precisely because of them.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolf, Meike","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb6b46eb5164f5673399db2a3a5ee143f7224557.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131074.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953614003773; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.06.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961737/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614003773","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health approaches","health discussion","given assumptions of human health","social dimensions of human","different health professionals","public health professionals","human world","human body","animal-disease","social factors","social sciences","disease ecologies","social science perspective","medical practitioners","medical anthropology","interplay of medical","complex entanglements","emergence of infectious diseases","animal behavior","multitude of animals","complex interconnectedness","humans","environmental conflicts","recent developments","biologists","veterinarians","novel way","multidisciplinary efforts","environments","consumption patterns","collaborations","topics","ecological concerns","objects of inquiry","interspecies encounters","microbes","skepticism","crucial role","biocultural phenomenon","spite","interactions","Abstract Today\u0027s era of globalization","context","grander scale","plants","pathogens","constitution","political processes","management","greater sensitivity","globalized modernity","endeavor","need","response","paper","idea","essay"],"language":"en"},

In the past years, a few commercial multiplex RT-PCR assays have been used to detect respiratory viruses in spite of the high cost. In the present study, an improved single-tube multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay for simultaneous detection of 13 respiratory viruses was evaluated and compared with a previously reported two-tube assay as the reference method using clinical nasopharyngeal aspirates samples. Of 310 prospectively tested respiratory specimens selected from children hospitalized with acute respiratory illness, 226 (72.90%, 226/310) and 214 (69.03%, 214/310) positive for one or more viruses were identified by the single-tube and the two-tube assays, respectively, with combined test results showing good concordance (Kappa value = 0.874). Individually, the single-tube assay for adenovirus (Adv), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) and parainfluenza virus type 4 (PIV4) showed the significantly superior sensitivities to those of the two-tube assay. No false positives were found.

We conducted adult SARI surveillance in Blantyre, Malawi. From January 2011 to December 2013, individuals aged \u2265 15 years with SARI (both inpatients and outpatients) were enrolled at a large teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. We estimated hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI incidence rates and assessed factors associated with influenza positivity and clinical severity (Modified Early Warning Score \u003E 4). We enrolled 1,126 SARI cases; 163 (14.5%) were positive for influenza. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence was 50.3%. Annual incidence of hospital-attended influenza-associated SARI was 9.7\u201316.8 cases per 100,000 population. Human immunodeficiency virus was associated with a 5-fold greater incidence (incidence rate ratio 4.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.83\u20136.32). On multivariable analysis, female gender, as well as recruitment in hot, rainy season (December to March; adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.82, 95% CI: 1.57\u20135.06) and cool, dry season (April to August; aOR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.35\u20134.15), was associated with influenza positivity, whereas influenza-positive patients were less likely to be HIV-infected (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43\u20130.80) or have viral coinfection (aOR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.36\u20130.73).

In this high HIV prevalence population, influenza was associated with nearly 15% of hospital-attended SARI. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is an important risk factor for clinical severity in all-cause and influenza-associated SARI.

Within the past years, a great number of disease-modifying treatments have emerged; however, efficacious treatments and a cure for MS await discovery. Thymosins, soluble hormone-like peptides produced by the thymus gland, can mediate immune and non-immune physiological processes and have gained interest in recent years as therapeutics in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Methods: Pubmed was searched with no time constraints for articles using a combination of the keywords \u201Cthymosin/s\u201D or \u201Cthymus factor/s\u201D AND \u201Cmultiple sclerosis\u201D, mesh terms with no language restriction. Results: Here, we review the state-of-the-art on the effects of thymosins on MS and its experimental models. In particular, we describe what is known in this field on the roles of thymosin-\u03B11 (T\u03B11) and -\u03B24 (T\u03B24) as potential anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective and remyelinating molecules and their mechanisms of action. Conclusion: Based on the data that T\u03B11 and T\u03B24 act as anti-inflammatory molecules and as inducers of myelin repair and neuronal protection, respectively, a possible therapeutic application in MS for T\u03B11 and T\u03B24 alone or combined with other approved drugs may be envisaged. This approach is reasonable in light of the current clinical usage of T\u03B11 and data demonstrating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of T\u03B24 in clinical practice.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Severa, Martina; Zhang, Jing; Giacomini, Elena; Rizzo, Fabiana; Etna, Marilena Paola; Cruciani, Melania; Garaci, Enrico; Chopp, Michael; Coccia, Eliana Marina","journal":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c55bcbbc026105e30552c1c955cabef0bffcdba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104151.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30317071/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034818303584; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2018.09.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034818303584","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T\u03B24 act","efficacy of T\u03B24","anti-inflammatory molecules","current clinical usage of T\u03B11","data","Multiple sclerosis","remyelinating molecules","potential anti-inflammatory","clinical practice","recent years","roles of thymosin","past years","effects of thymosins","thymus gland","efficacious treatments","thymus factor","time constraints","great number of disease","non-immune physiological processes","inducers of myelin repair","neuronal protection","possible therapeutic application","therapeutics","light","peptides","combination","mesh terms","tolerability","safety","articles","keywords","cure","Abstract Background","autoimmune diseases","mechanisms of action","language restriction","Pubmed","soluble hormone","experimental models","approach","field","discovery","approved drugs","Methods","individuals","Conclusion","Results"],"language":"en"},

Ursidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, research on T cell immunology in this family, especially structural immunology, is lacking. In this study, the structure of the key trimolecular complex pMHC-1 (aka pAime-128), which binds a peptide from canine distemper virus, was solved for the first time using giant panda as a representative species of Ursidae. The structural characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complex, including the unique pockets in the peptide-binding groove (PBG), were analyzed in detail. Comparing the panda pMHC-I to others in the bear family and extending the comparison to other mammals revealed distinct features. The interaction between MHC-I and \u03B22m, the features of pAime-128 involved in TCR docking and CD8 binding, the anchor sites in the PBG, and the CTL epitopes of potential viruses that infect pandas were concretely clarified. Unique features of pMHC-I viral antigen presentation in the panda were revealed by solving the three-dimensional structure of pAime-128. The distinct characteristics of pAime-128 indicate an unusual event that emerged during the evolution of the MHC system in the bear family. These results provide a new platform for research on panda CTL immunity and the design of vaccines for application in the bear family. IMPORTANCE Ursidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, the study of its immunology, especially structural immunology, is extremely rare to date. In this paper, we first crystallized the key complex pMHC-I, taking the giant panda as its representative species. Structural characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complexes, contains the unique pockets of PBG were analyzed in detail. Comparison of the panda pMHC-I in the bear family and other mammals, almost definite features was displayed. Meanwhile, the interaction between HC and LV, the unique features of pMHC-I in the CD8 binding and TCR docking, validation of anchor site in the PBG, and epitopes of potential viruses infected with the pandas, were concretely clarified. These unique characteristics of pMHC-I clearly indicate an unusual situation during the evolution of MHC molecules in the endangered pandas.

In this work, we report the structure of a biologically relevant G-quadruplex within the LTR promoter region of HIV-1. The guanine-rich sequence designated LTR-IV forms a well-defined structure in physiological cationic solution. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of this sequence reveals a parallel-stranded G-quadruplex containing a single-nucleotide thymine bulge, which participates in a conserved stacking interaction with a neighboring single-nucleotide adenine loop. Transcription analysis in a HIV-1 replication competent cell indicates that the LTR-IV region may act as a modulator of G-quadruplex formation in the LTR promoter.

Moreover, the input/output transmission networks of the SARS epidemic are built according to the definition of in-out flow. The spatiotemporal distribution of the SARS in-out flow, spatial distribution and temporal change of node characteristic parameters, and the structural characteristics of the SARS transmission networks are comprehensively and systematically explored. The results show that (1) Beijing and Guangdong had the highest risk of self-spread and output cases, and prevention/control measures directed toward self-spread cases in Beijing should have focused on the later period of the SARS epidemic; (2) the SARS transmission networks in mainland China had significant clustering characteristics, with two clustering areas of output cases centered in Beijing and Guangdong; (3) Guangdong was the original source of the SARS epidemic, and while the infected cases of most other provinces occurred mainly during the early period, there was no significant spread to the surrounding provinces; in contrast, although the input/output interactions between Beijing and the other provinces countrywide began during the mid-late epidemic period, SARS in Beijing showed a significant capacity for spatial spreading; (4) Guangdong had a significant range of spatial spreading throughout the entire epidemic period, while Beijing and its surrounding provinces formed a separate, significant range of high-risk spreading during the mid-late period; especially in late period, the influence range of Beijing\u2019s neighboring provinces, such as Hebei, was even slightly larger than that of Beijing; and (5) the input network had a low-intensity spread capacity and middle-level influence range, while the output network had an extensive high-intensity spread capacity and influence range that covered almost the entire country, and this spread and influence indicated that significant clustering characteristics increased gradually. This analysis of the epidemic in-out flow and its corresponding transmission network helps reveal the potential spatiotemporal characteristics and evolvement mechanism of the SARS epidemic and provides more effective theoretical support for prevention and control measures.","publish_time":"2012-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, BiSong; Gong, JianHua; Sun, Jun; Zhou, JiePing","journal":"Chin Sci Bull","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/334df63353e00d65b2c41452d0385053683eda5b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214741/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5501-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Beijing","China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic spread","significant spread","SARS transmission networks","entire epidemic period","mid-late epidemic period","epidemic process","significant capacity","significant clustering characteristics","self-spread cases","significant range of spatial spreading","output network","output transmission networks","Guangdong","significant range of high-risk spreading","mid-late period","output interactions","later period","early period","surrounding provinces","clustering areas of output cases","influence range of Beijing\u2019s neighboring provinces","infected cases","input network","middle-level influence range","highest risk of self-spread","potential spatiotemporal characteristics","corresponding transmission network","structural characteristics","spatial distribution","spatiotemporal distribution","mainland China","prevention","control measures","changing spatiotemporal patterns","low-intensity","reporting unit","interactions of information","entire country","extensive high-intensity","individual susceptible-infected","epidemiological investigation data","temporal change of node characteristic parameters","home address","effective theoretical support","onset location","evolvement mechanism","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","typical locations of individuals","material flows","Hebei","contrast","original source","regions","definition","results","analysis"],"language":"en"},

However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kobayashi, Tetsuro; Jung, Sung-mok; Linton, Natalie M.; Kinoshita, Ryo; Hayashi, Katsuma; Miyama, Takeshi; Anzai, Asami; Yang, Yichi; Yuan, Baoyin; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.; Suzuki, Ayako; Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"J Clin Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7073841.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32098019/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020580","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of death","actual risk","case fatality risk","infected individuals","ongoing COVID","high-risk individuals","observed dataset of reported cases","cumulative number of deaths","substantial number of asymptomatic","shorter virus detection windows","elderly","common epidemiological practice","given disease","underlying comorbidities","sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests","seasonal influenza","health authorities","general population","young adults","majority","additional care","epidemic","time","illness onset","uncertainty","proportion","mild infections","delay","severity of infection","approaches","division","ascertainment bias","technical obstacles","problems"],"language":"en"},

We modeled an individually randomized vaccine trial by generating a network of individuals and simulating an epidemic. The disease natural history followed a \u201Csusceptible-exposed-infectious/symptomatic (or infectious/asymptomatic)-recovered\u201D model. We then used 7 approaches to estimate VE(S), and we also estimated vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VE(P)). A corrected relative risk and an interval-censored Cox model accurately estimate VE(S) and only require serological testing of participants once, while a Cox model using only symptomatic infections returns biased estimates. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10% sample and imputing the remaining infection statuses yields unbiased VE(S) estimates across values of the basic reproduction number (R(0)) and accurate estimates of VE(P) for higher R(0) values. Identifying resource-preserving methods for accurately estimating VE(S) and VE(P) is important in designing trials for diseases with a high proportion of asymptomatic infection.","publish_time":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kahn, Rebecca; Hitchings, Matt; Wang, Rui; Bellan, Steven E; Lipsitch, Marc","journal":"American Journal of Epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e78a31fc6fa0f5a64e0cafd103bccbf76f824409.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6357804.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwy239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30329134/; https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-pdf/188/2/467/27689961/kwy239.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unbiased VE","accurate estimates of VE","Vaccine efficacy","high proportion of asymptomatic infection","important endpoint of vaccine trials","remaining infection statuses","symptomatic infections","values","biased estimates","symptoms","randomized vaccine trial","approaches","interval-censored Cox model","higher R","serological endpoints","resource-intensive","serological testing of participants","pathogens","long-term sequelae","sample","diseases","progression","susceptibility","basic reproduction number","corrected relative risk","network of individuals","onward transmission","information","congenital Zika syndrome","disease natural history","methods","epidemic","resources"],"language":"en"},

Thus, a coronaviral infection of glial cells could lead to the production of inflammatory molecules that have been associated with central nervous system pathologies such as MS.","publish_time":"2000-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edwards, Julie A; Denis, Fran\u00E7ois; Talbot, Pierre J","journal":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c46612b3da6c1968adba5d16892f1024b0d1b1fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119868.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165572800002666; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572800002666","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human astrocytic cell line U","human microglial cell line CHME","MS","primary cultures of human astrocytes","OC43 strain of human coronavirus","coronaviral infection of glial cells","production of inflammatory molecules","augmented nitric oxide production","immune-mediated demyelinating disease","upregulation of IL","MCP","TNF-\u03B1","humans","neuroinvasive","rodents","Abstract Multiple sclerosis","central nervous system pathologies","activity of matrix metalloproteinases","mRNA expression","Coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

The causative agent of this deadly disease, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), arises from feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). The review summarizes our current knowledge of the genome and proteome of feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), focusing on the viral surface (spike) protein S and the five accessory proteins. We also review the current classification of FCoVs into distinct serotypes and biotypes, cellular receptors of FCoVs and their presumed role in viral virulence, and discuss other aspects of FIPV-induced pathogenesis. Our current knowledge of genetic differences between FECVs and FIPVs has been mainly based on comparative sequence analyses that revealed \u201Cdiscriminatory\u201D mutations that are present in FIPVs but not in FECVs. Most of these mutations result in amino acid substitutions in the S protein and these may have a critical role in the switch from FECV to FIPV. In most cases, the precise roles of these mutations in the molecular pathogenesis of FIP have not been tested experimentally in the natural host, mainly due to the lack of suitable experimental tools including genetically engineered virus mutants. We discuss the recent progress in the development of FCoV reverse genetics systems suitable to generate recombinant field viruses containing appropriate mutations for in vivo studies.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tekes, G.; Thiel, H.-J.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b699edbd45249b3ffc2809281c2bf75c42cd70d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112361.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2016.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27712624/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352716300410; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352716300410","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feline infectious peritonitis virus","appropriate mutations","current classification of FCoVs","small number of mutations","Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis","protein S","S protein","proteome of feline coronaviruses","engineered virus mutants","feline enteric coronavirus","animal virus diseases","aspects of FIPV","FIPVs","FECVs","review","current knowledge of genetic differences","cellular receptors of FCoVs","molecular pathogenesis of FIP","presumed role","viral virulence","viral surface","critical role","induced pathogenesis","lack of suitable experimental tools","development of FCoV reverse genetics systems suitable","recombinant field viruses","distinct serotypes","deadly disease","biotypes","amino acid substitutions","genome","harmless persistent infection","course","spike","switch","comparative sequence analyses","recent progress","causative agent","precise roles","accessory proteins","studies","cases","pathogenicity","fatal outcome","natural host"],"language":"en"},

Many proteins regulate these signaling pathways including ubiquitin enzymes. The ubiquitin-activating (E1), -conjugating (E2), and -ligating (E3) enzymes work together to link ubiquitin, a small protein, onto other ubiquitin molecules or target proteins to mediate various effector functions. The tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family is a group of E3 ligases implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions including cell cycle progression, autophagy, and innate immunity. Many antiviral signaling pathways, including type-I interferon and NF-\u03BAB, are TRIM-regulated, thus influencing the course of infection. Additionally, several TRIMs directly restrict viral replication either through proteasome-mediated degradation of viral proteins or by interfering with different steps of the viral replication cycle. In addition, new studies suggest that TRIMs can exert their effector functions via the synthesis of unconventional polyubiquitin chains, including unanchored (non-covalently attached) polyubiquitin chains. TRIM-conferred viral inhibition has selected for viruses that encode direct and indirect TRIM antagonists. Furthermore, new evidence suggests that the same antagonists encoded by viruses may hijack TRIM proteins to directly promote virus replication.

Heterologous polyclonal antibodies are obtained from animals hyperimmunised with a pathogen or toxin. Aims The aims of this review are to examine the history of animal polyclonal antibody therapy use, their development into safe and effective products and the potential application to humans for emerging and neglected infectious diseases. Methods A literature search of OVID Medline and OVID Embase databases was undertaken to identify articles on the safety, efficacy and ongoing development of polyclonal antibodies. The search contained database-specific MeSH and EMTREE terms in combination with pertinent text-words: polyclonal antibodies and rare/neglected diseases, antivenins, immunoglobulins, serum sickness, anaphylaxis, drug safety, post marketing surveillance, rabies, human influenza, Dengue, West Nile, Nipah, Hendra, Marburg, MERS, Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, and Crimean-Congo. No language limits were applied. The final search was completed on 20.06.2015. Of 1960 articles, title searches excluded many irrelevant articles, yielding 303 articles read in full. Of these, 179 are referenced in this study. Results Serum therapy was first used in the 1890s against diphtheria. Early preparation techniques yielded products contaminated with reactogenic animal proteins. The introduction of enzymatic digestion, and purification techniques substantially improved their safety profile. The removal of the Fc fragment of antibodies further reduces hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of polyclonal antibodies against various infections, toxins and venoms. Products are being developed against infections for which prophylactic and therapeutic options are currently limited, such as avian influenza, Ebola and other zoonotic viruses. Conclusions Polyclonal antibodies have been successfully applied to rabies, envenomation and intoxication. Polyclonal production provides an exciting opportunity to revolutionise the prognosis of both longstanding neglected tropical diseases as well as emerging infectious threats to humans.","publish_time":"2016-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dixit, Rashmi; Herz, Jenny; Dalton, Richard; Booy, Robert","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c79b541523d38fd66a8ccb50ab64c6643b76af7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131169.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16000426; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16000426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26802604/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.01.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OVID Medline","OVID Embase"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["efficacy of polyclonal antibodies","Heterologous polyclonal antibodies","Conclusions Polyclonal antibodies","ongoing development of polyclonal antibodies","Polyclonal production","Fc fragment of antibodies","neglected diseases","infectious diseases","history of animal polyclonal antibody therapy use","irrelevant articles","drug safety","rabies","immunoglobulins","longstanding neglected tropical diseases","effective products","safety profile","humans","toxins","final search","aims","literature search of OVID Medline","emerging infectious threats","Results Serum therapy","post-exposure prophylaxis of various infections","human influenza","avian influenza","purification techniques","serum sickness","OVID Embase databases","Early preparation techniques","reactogenic animal proteins","post marketing surveillance","Marburg","EMTREE terms","combination","anaphylaxis","West Nile","pertinent text-words","Hemorrhagic Fever Virus","MERS","Hendra","Nipah","Dengue","prognosis","antivenins","database-specific MeSH","potential application","Abstract Background Passive immunotherapy","treatment","animals","Ebola","therapeutic options","exciting opportunity","Methods","title searches","introduction of enzymatic digestion","Crimean-Congo","zoonotic viruses","hypersensitivity reactions","century","removal","venoms","Clinical studies","pathogen","review","envenomation","intoxication","language limits","diphtheria","study"],"language":"en"},

By using a fluorescently labeled antigen as a tag for a complementary cell surface immunoglobulin, antigen-specific plasma/plasmablast cells were sorted from the rest of the cell population by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Amplification of cognate pairs of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes followed by DNA transfection into 293FT cells resulted in the highly efficient production of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies from a variety of immunized animals.

Five such samples, originating from insect pools, skunk brain, human feces and sewer effluent, collected between 1955 and 1980, resulted in pathology when inoculated into suckling mice. In this study, sequence-independent amplification of partially purified viral nucleic acids and small scale shotgun sequencing was used on mouse brain and muscle tissues. A single viral agent was identified in each sample. For each virus, between 16% to 57% of the viral genome was acquired by sequencing only 42\u2013108 plasmid inserts. Viruses derived from human feces or sewer effluent belonged to the Picornaviridae family and showed between 80% to 91% amino acid identities to known picornaviruses. The complete polyprotein sequence of one virus showed strong similarity to a simian picornavirus sequence in the provisional Sapelovirus genus. Insects and skunk derived viral sequences exhibited amino acid identities ranging from 25% to 98% to the segmented genomes of viruses within the Reoviridae family. Two isolates were highly divergent: one is potentially a new species within the orthoreovirus genus, and the other is a new species within the orbivirus genus. We demonstrate that a simple, inexpensive, and rapid metagenomics approach is effective for identifying known and highly divergent new viruses in homogenized tissues of acutely infected mice.","publish_time":"2008-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Victoria, Joseph G.; Kapoor, Amit; Dupuis, Kent; Schnurr, David P.; Delwart, Eric L.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d0b62b91c66f47c6aff69dfa0ed2c25ffe064ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2533695.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18818738/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000163","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral sequences","viral genome","viral nucleic acids","divergent new viruses","new species","Viral surveillance programs","single viral agent","amino acid identities","skunk brain","human feces","sewer effluent","nucleic acid tests","orthoreovirus genus","orbivirus genus","simian picornavirus sequence","sequence-independent amplification","complete polyprotein sequence","segmented genomes of viruses","provisional Sapelovirus genus","mouse brain","homogenized tissues","muscle tissues","Reoviridae family","infectious samples","infected mice","Picornaviridae family","suckling mice","small scale shotgun sequencing","strong similarity","diagnostic labs","rapid metagenomics approach","insect pools","available cell culture","study","Insects","picornaviruses","pathology","plasmid inserts","isolates"],"language":"en"},

Materials and methods A prospective, observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Chennai, Tamil Nadu from September 2015 to July 2016. Respiratory samples from patients hospitalised with suspected acute viral respiratory infections were sent for molecular PCR based technique. Results Total 40 patients were studied. The most common respiratory virus was rhino virus in 9(22.5%) patients followed by influenza H3/H3N2 in 7(17.5%), H1N1 in 6(15%) and RSV in 4 (10%). After the diagnosis of the viral infection, antibiotics were completely stopped in 10(30.3%) patients and de-escalated to a narrower spectrum agent in another 10 (30.3%) patients. No patient whose antibiotics were de-escalated died, whereas there were 5 deaths in patients in whom de-escalation was not done. Conclusion Diagnosis with PCR facilitates early use of antiviral agents, droplet isolation, prevention of cross-transmission of viruses and antibiotic stewardship practice.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rao, P Vishnu; Tarigopula, Anil; Bansal, Nitin; Sethuraman, Nandini; Gopalakrishnan, Ram","journal":"Indian Journal of Medical Specialities","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b9366e8170794dc98b4116bfc2832f4fa9a6fdf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0976288417300772; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0976288417300772","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","RSV"],"locations":["Chennai"],"keyphrases":["hospitalised patients","hospitalized patients","influenza respiratory viral infections","importance of influenza","influenza strains","Respiratory samples","influenza H3","suspected acute viral respiratory infections","common respiratory virus","recent influenza pandemic","antibiotics","molecular PCR","rhino virus","Conclusion Diagnosis","observational study","early use of antiviral agents","droplet isolation","transmission of viruses","prevention of cross","outcome","tertiary care hospital","California H1N1strain increased awareness","Chennai","Tamil Nadu","antibiotic stewardship practice","methods","Abstract Background","clinical profile","reports","Materials","H3N2","narrower spectrum agent","technique","deaths","de-escalation","RSV"],"language":"en"},

The functional unit of Mpro is a homodimer, and each subunit has a His-41\u22EFCys-145 catalytic dyad. Current thinking in this area is that Mpro dimerization is essential for catalysis, although the influence of the substrate binding on the dimer formation has never been explored. Here, we delineate the contributions of the peptide substrate to Mpro dimerization. Enzyme kinetic assays indicate that the monomeric mutant R298A/L exhibits lower activity but in a cooperative manner. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that in the presence of substrates, the major species of R298A/L shows a significant size shift toward the dimeric form and the monomer-dimer dissociation constant of R298A/L decreases by 12- to 17-fold, approaching that for wild-type. Furthermore, this substrate-induced dimerization was found to be reversible after substrates were removed. Based on the crystal structures, a key residue, Glu-166, which is responsible for recognizing the Gln-P1 of the substrate and binding to Ser-1 of another protomer, will interact with Asn-142 and block the S1 subsite entrance in the monomer. Our studies indicate that mutation of Glu-166 in the R298A mutant indeed blocks the substrate-induced dimerization. This demonstrates that Glu-166 plays a pivotal role in connecting the substrate binding site with the dimer interface. We conclude that protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions are closely correlated in Mpro.","publish_time":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Shu-Chun; Chang, Gu-Gang; Chou, Chi-Yuan","journal":"Biophysical Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9040df65fd6030f6ca38340e00ce9d108b3e8725.json; document_parses/pdf_json/318e5aa581fd8f7c618d5fb7468df36720a75a57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2849084.xml.json","url":"http://www.cell.com/article/S0006349509060858/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20371333/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349509060858; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349509060858; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2009.12.4272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mpro dimerization","substrate-induced dimerization","peptide substrate","substrate binding site","R298A mutant","monomeric mutant R298A","protein-protein interactions","functional unit of Mpro","monomer-dimer dissociation constant of R298A","major species of R298A","dimer interface","dimer formation","protein-ligand","mutation of Glu","presence of substrates","main protease","maturation of SARS coronavirus","development of anti-SARS drugs","dimeric form","exhibits lower activity","area","significant size shift","attractive targets","pivotal role","autocleavage of polyproteins","Enzyme kinetic assays","key residue","homodimer","ab","influence","catalysis","cooperative manner","crystal structures","Gln-P1","S1 subsite entrance","decreases","Ser","papain","contributions","Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses","Current thinking","Cys","catalytic dyad","protomer","Asn","studies","wild-type","fold","subunit"],"language":"en"},

Neurological examination revealed non-ambulatory tetraparesis with decreased postural reactions in all four limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal nerve root swelling on the right at C6/C7 and C7/T1, while ultrasonography demonstrated swelling of the right brachial plexus. To understand the cause of the nerve swelling, the right musculocutaneous nerve arising from the brachial plexus and the pectoralis muscle were biopsied. Histologically, there was evidence of neurolymphomatosis (neurotropic lymphoma) with Wallerian degeneration and denervation atrophy of myofibres. The neoplastic lymphoid cells expressed CD79a, CD20 and CD56. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of B-cell neurolymphomatosis was made. Expression of CD56, synonymous with neural cell adhesion molecule, is rare in B-cell lymphomas and has not been reported in feline B-cell lymphomas or feline neurolymphomatosis. CD56 expression was suspected to have played an important role in neurotropism of the neoplastic cells in this case.","publish_time":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsueh, C.-S.; Tsai, C.-Y.; Lee, J.C.-S.; Kao, C.-L.; Wang, F.-I.; Jeng, C.-R.; Chang, H.-W.; Pang, V.

Sensitive diagnostic assays have increased the detection of viruses in asymptomatic individuals. The clinical significance of asymptomatic respiratory viral infection in infants is unknown. Methods. High-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect 13 common respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal specimens collected during 2028 visits from 362 infants followed from near birth up to 12 months of age. Specimens were collected at monthly interval (months 1\u20136 and month 9) and during upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) episodes. Subjects were followed closely for acute otitis media (AOM) development. Results. Viruses were detected in 76% of 394 URTI specimens and 27% of asymptomatic monthly specimens. Rhinovirus was detected most often; multiple viruses were detected in 29% of the specimens. Generalized mixed-model analyses associated symptoms with increasing age and female sex; detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and adenovirus was highly associated with symptoms. Increasing age was also associated with multiple virus detection. Overall, 403 asymptomatic viral infections in 237 infants were identified. Viral load was significantly higher in URTI specimens than asymptomatic specimens but did not differentiate cases of URTI with and without AOM complication. The rate of AOM complicating URTI was 27%; no AOM occurred following asymptomatic viral infections. AOM development was associated with increasing age and infection with RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus. Conclusions. Compared to symptomatic infection, asymptomatic viral infection in infants is associated with young age, male sex, low viral load, specific viruses, and single virus detection. Asymptomatic viral infection did not result in AOM.","publish_time":"2014-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chonmaitree, Tasnee; Alvarez-Fernandez, Pedro; Jennings, Kristofer; Trujillo, Rocio; Marom, Tal; Loeffelholz, Michael J.; Miller, Aaron L.; McCormick, David P.; Patel, Janak A.; Pyles, Richard B.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f998dab60e13c3df179653ab1f8014863e544ba1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4318943.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/60/1/1/17352278/ciu714.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25205769/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciu714","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URTI","AOM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic specimens","URTI specimens","asymptomatic viral infections","asymptomatic monthly specimens","clinical significance of asymptomatic respiratory viral infection","detection of viruses","asymptomatic individuals","increasing age","infants","nasopharyngeal specimens","AOM development","symptomatic infection","months of age","multiple viruses","rate of AOM","AOM complication","low viral load","common respiratory viruses","upper respiratory tract infection","detection of respiratory syncytial virus","young age","multiple virus detection","specific viruses","cases of URTI","Rhinovirus","single virus detection","RSV","symptoms","adenovirus","female sex","monthly interval","Sensitive diagnostic assays","quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays","High-throughput","influenza","enterovirus","acute otitis media","mixed-model analyses","near birth","visits","episodes","metapneumovirus","Subjects","bocavirus","Conclusions","Background","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

We have previously confirmed the immunogenic potential of recombinant L. lactis expressing OmpA (LacVax\u00AE OmpA) in BALB/c mice. In the present study, we have characterized the humoral and cellular immune profile of LacVax\u00AE OmpA and assessed its protective efficacy using a newly developed human like murine shigellosis model. The significant increase in OmpA specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA and a Th1 dominant immune response (indicated by high INF-\u03B3/IL-4 ratio) in LacVax\u00AE OmpA immunized mice revealed successful activation of humoral and cellular immunity.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. METHODS: It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. These confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD \u00B1 22.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of Saudi Arabia as well and explore potential preventable risk factors.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Altamimi, Asmaa; Abu-Saris, Raghib; El-Metwally, Ashraf; Alaifan, Taghreed; Alamri, Aref","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edee452881f826fb72c58ee68a982789b12aa99d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7049846.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32149148/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/9629747","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Al Qassim"],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","Riyadh"],"keyphrases":["cases of MERS","confirmed cases","identification of suspected cases","suspected patients","MERS-CoV epidemic","prevalence of MERS","suspected specimen","regions of Saudi Arabia","years","non-MERS SARI","clinical presentations of MERS","subject regions","confirmation","potential demographic risk factors","demographic markers","potential preventable risk factors","surveillance system-based study","Al Qassim regions","future plans","mean age","contagious disease","Future studies","laboratory results","summer season admission","Riyadh","specific characteristics","management","male gender","independent predictors","evidence","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","prevention","total","data","findings","higher chances","SD","METHODS","real challenge","males","CONCLUSION","nature","diagnosis","Introduction"],"language":"en"},

These are waves of huge social energy. Often they are of the destructive character, a kind of information tsunami. But, they can carry as well positive improvements in the human society, as waves of decision making matching rational recommendations of societal institutes. The main distinguishing features of these waves are their high amplitude, coherence (homogeneous character of social actions generated by them), and short time needed for their generation and relaxation. Such waves can be treated as large scale exhibition of the Bandwagon effect. We show that this socio-psychic phenomenon can be modeled on the basis of the recently developed {\\it social laser theory}. This theory can be used to model {\\it stimulated amplification of coherent social actions}.\u0022Actions\u0022are treated very generally, from mass protests to votes and other collective decisions, as, e.g., acceptance (often unconscious) of some societal recommendations. In this paper, we concentrate on theory of laser resonators, physical vs. social. For the latter, we analyze in very detail functioning of the internet based Echo-Chambers.

The nodes of the network represent different types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships. An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on day $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals\u0027 social behaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability distributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is given for the basic SI (\u0022susceptible-infective\u0022) network contagion model, which focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main result is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of the system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves only one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network models, including\u0022removed\u0022(R) and\u0022exposed\u0022(E) classes, are formulated. These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for the SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of different kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social distancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an algorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a number of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as the framework\u0027s relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent based contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic modelling.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hurd, T.

From an initial individual (the patient zero), the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates, creating new populations of infected people. Every individual can either die or infect and, afterwards, be sent to the recovered population. Relevant terms such as re-infection probability, super-spreading rate or traveling rate are introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity. The Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability of ending after several iterations, without setting this value either. Infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some iterations, when considering social isolation measures and the high number recovered and dead people, the number of infected people starts decreasing in subsequent iterations. Furthermore, a parallel multi-virus version is proposed in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations. Finally, the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models, in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase. As application case, the problem of electricity load time series forecasting has been addressed, showing quite remarkable performance.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u0027inez-\u0027Alvarez, F.; Asencio-Cort\u0027es, G.; Torres, J.

Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adapt our previously developed CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC), for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability of DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset collected from several hospitals around the world.

To accelerate this process, we present a deep learning based generative modeling framework, CogMol, to design drug candidates specific to a given target protein sequence with high off-target selectivity. We augment this generative framework with an in silico screening process that accounts for toxicity, to lower the failure rate of the generated drug candidates in later stages of the drug development pipeline. We apply this framework to three relevant proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, namely non-structural protein 9 (NSP9) replicase, main protease, and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Docking to the target proteins demonstrate the potential of these generated molecules as ligands. Structural similarity analyses further imply novelty of the generated molecules with respect to the training dataset as well as possible biological association of a number of generated molecules that might be of relevance to COVID-19 therapeutic design. While the validation of these molecules is underway, we release ~ 3000 novel COVID-19 drug candidates generated using our framework.

Here we propose an integrative maximum likelihood analysis of both cluster data in the ME region and importations in Europe to assess transmission scenario and incidence of sporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model integrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the zoonotic/environmental transmission and underascertainment. Maximum likelihood estimates for the ME region indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic (R=0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.77) associated with a 0.28 (95% CI 0.12-0.85) daily rate of sporadic introductions. Infections in the region appear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with possible underascertainment (95% CI of estimated to observed sporadic cases in the range 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of flight passenger data from the region indicate areas at high risk of importation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security, this analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates, suggests reinforced surveillance to limit underascertainment, and calls for increased alertness in high-risk areas worldwide.","publish_time":"2013-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poletto, Chiara; Pelat, Camille; Levy-Bruhl, Daniel; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Boelle, Pierre-Yves; Colizza, Vittoria","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4016fe18801a8c01232ecdbb6767f73ef671d02c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.1481v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Europe"],"keyphrases":["region","transmission scenario","cluster data","mobility data","possible underascertainment","future evolution","incidence of sporadic infections","sporadic cases","integrative maximum likelihood analysis","global health security","spatial-transmission model","Maximum likelihood estimates","baseline scenario","global public health concerns","future reference","current situation","Analyses of flight passenger data","novel coronavirus","high-risk areas","environmental transmissions","daily rate of sporadic introductions","time evolution","Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","Middle East","updates","MERS-CoV","Europe","variations","importations","reinforced surveillance","subcritical epidemic","occurrence","immediate threat","increased alertness","high risk of importation","confidence interval","appearance","range","approach"],"language":"en"},

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: 1) people actively share their experience of COVID-19 via online social media, 2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting on social media, and 3) online users are frequently equipped with powerful mobile devices that can perform data processing and analytics. We envision unprecedented opportunities to leverage posts generated by ordinary people to build real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating COVID-19 propagation data. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information on COVID-19 with prevailing rumors and misinformation? How to inform the general public about the state of the spread timely and effectively? How to leverage the computational power on edge devices to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing based risk alert systems.

While traditional journalistic media has tried to adapt to the rapidly evolving situation, alternative news media on the Internet have given the events their own ideological spin. Such voices have been criticized for furthering societal confusion and spreading potentially dangerous\u0022fake news\u0022or conspiracy theories via social media and other online channels. The current study analyzes the factual basis of such fears in an initial computational content analysis of alternative news media\u0027s output on Facebook during the early Corona crisis, based on a large German data set from January to the second half of March 2020. Using computational content analysis, methods, reach, interactions, actors, and topics of the messages were examined, as well as the use of fabricated news and conspiracy theories. The analysis revealed that the alternative news media stay true to message patterns and ideological foundations identified in prior research. While they do not spread obvious lies, they are predominantly sharing overly critical, even anti-systemic messages, opposing the view of the mainstream news media and the political establishment. With this pandemic populism, they contribute to a contradictory, menacing, and distrusting worldview, as portrayed in detail in this analysis.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boberg, Svenja; Quandt, Thorsten; Schatto-Eckrodt, Tim; Frischlich, Lena","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08b769b0017cd515b2f3fa802fb460cfb2208a63.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02566v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mainstream news media","fake news","social media","use of fabricated news","traditional journalistic media","initial computational content analysis of alternative news media\u0027s output","conspiracy theories","ideological foundations","political establishment","societal effects","ideological spin","pandemic populism","furthering societal confusion","anti-systemic messages","Facebook","message patterns","methods","reach","fears","early Corona crisis","actors","interactions","factual basis","large German data set","communication systems","unprecedented ways","Internet","evolving situation","prior research","online channels","contradictory","current study","events","topics","distrusting worldview","voices","obvious lies","half","COVID"],"language":"en"},

Using this to compare the relative decay of the number of deaths per day between different regions in Italy, Spain and England, each applying in principle the same social distancing procedures across the whole country, I obtain an estimate of the total fraction of the population which had already become infected by April 10th. In the most heavily affected regions, Lombardy, Madrid and London, this fraction is higher than expected, i.e. $\\approx 0.3$. This result can then be converted to a determination of the infection fatality rate $ifr$, which appears to be $ifr \\approx 0.0025-0.005$, and even smaller in London, somewhat lower than usually assumed. Alternatively, the result can also be interpreted as an effectively larger fraction of the population than simple counting would suggest if there is a variation in susceptibility to infection with a variance of up to a value of about 2. The implications are very similar for either interpretation or for a combination of effects.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thorne, Robert S","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00495v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain","England","Madrid"],"keyphrases":["London","total fraction","larger fraction","large population","ifr","approx","result","different regions","affected regions","simple counting","infection fatality rate","simple deterministic model","number of deaths","Italy","day","Madrid","spread of Covid","interpretation","country","social distancing procedures","principle","England","Spain","Lombardy","relative decay","variance","susceptibility","determination","estimate","implications","combination of effects","variation","value"],"language":"en"},

Here we show that the decrease in global fossil CO2 emissions during the first quarter of 2020 was of 5.8% (542 Mt CO2 with a 20% 1-{\\sigma} uncertainty). Unlike other emerging estimates, ours show the temporal dynamics of emissions based on actual emissions data from power generation (for 29 countries) and industry (for 73 countries), on near real time activity data for road transportation (for 132 countries), aviation and maritime transportation, and on heating degree days for commercial and residential sectors emissions (for 206 countries). These dynamic estimates cover all of the human induced CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. The largest share of COVID-related decreases in emissions are due to decreases in industry (157.9 Mt CO2, -7.1% compared to 2019), followed by road transportation (145.7 Mt CO2, -8.3%), power generation (131.6 Mt CO2, -3.8%), residential (47.8 Mt CO2, -3.6%), fishing and maritime transport (35.5Mt CO2, -13.3%) and aviation (33.4 Mt CO2, -8.0%). Regionally, decreases in emissions from China were the largest and earliest (-10.3%), followed by Europe (EU-27\u0026UK) (-4.3%) and the U.S. (-4.2%). Relative decreases of regional CO2 emissions are consistent with regional nitrogen oxides concentrations observed by satellites and ground-based networks. Despite the unprecedented decreases in CO2 emissions and comparable decreases in economic activities, we monitored decreases in the carbon intensity (Emission per unit of GDP) in China (3.5%), the U.S. (4.5%) and Europe (5.4%) over the first quarter, suggesting that carbon-intensive activities have been disproportionally impacted.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zhu; Deng, Zhu; Ciais, Philippe; Lei, Ruixue; Davis, Steven J.; Feng, Sha; Zheng, Bo; Cui, Duo; Dou, Xinyu; He, Pan; Zhu, Biqing; Lu, Chenxi; Ke, Piyu; Sun, Taochun; Wang, Yuan; Yue, Xu; Wang, Yilong; Lei, Yadong; Zhou, Hao; Cai, Zhaonan; Wu, Yuhui; Guo, Runtao; Han, Tingxuan; Xue, Jinjun; Boucher, Olivier; Chevallier, Frederic; Boucher, Eulalie; Wei, Yimin; Zhang, Qiang; Guan, Dabo; Gong, Peng; Kammen, Daniel M.; He, Kebin; Schellnhuber, Hans Joachim","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7a821216e5187358350e37331cf9838043a0c92.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13614v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU"],"locations":["U.S.","China","Europe"],"keyphrases":["Mt CO2","global fossil CO2 emissions","Relative decreases of regional CO2 emissions","human induced CO2 emissions","unprecedented decreases","actual emissions data","residential sectors emissions","temporal dynamics of emissions","comparable decreases","related decreases","countries","road transportation","maritime transportation","fossil fuel use","fossil fuel combustion","cement production","economic activities","unprecedented cessation of human activities","power generation","carbon-intensive activities","China","quarter","aviation","industry","Europe","global energy use","largest share of COVID","carbon intensity","emerging estimates","dynamic estimates","ground-based networks","regional nitrogen oxides concentrations","near real time activity data","satellites","heating degree days","pandemic","unit of GDP","fishing","UK","sigma","uncertainty"],"language":"en"},

The basic reproduction number, R0 is derived using the Next Generation Matrix method, while the importance of the position of patients within the meta-population model is assessed via stochastic simulation.

The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less dangerous...","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madas, Bal\u0027azs G.; Furi, P\u0027eter; Farkas, \u0027Arp\u0027ad; Nagy, Attila; Czitrovszky, Alad\u0027ar; Bal\u0027ash\u0027azy, Imre; Schay, Guszt\u0027av G.; Horv\u0027ath, Alp\u0027ar","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/608fc62ae7d10710dd49a9bc0cd3d87fcf8d282d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05882v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peripheral airways","upper airways","SARS-CoV","extrathoracic airways","deposition distribution of SARS","induction of COVID","cases COVID","pathogen of COVID","cough-generated aerosol","respiratory droplets","inhalation of aerosol","infected person coughs","Aerosol size distribution","cellular entry","fatal pneumonia","new coronavirus disease","target cells","spread","experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","probability of direct infection","bystander cough","normal breathing","Stochastic Lung Deposition Model","people infections","times higher","enhancement of viral load","literature","purpose","sneezes","parameters","targets","exposure","attention","present study","enzyme","nose","angiotensin","ACE2","receptors","talks","environment","pathogenesis","number of pathogens","majority of persons","aim","huge efforts","results","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

There have been many advancements in the design of a face mask and the present treatise describes a face mask in which a simple textile triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) serves the purpose of filtration of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed mask is designed with multilayer protection sheets, in which the first two layers act as triboelectric (TE) filter and the outer one is a smart filter. The conjugated effect of contact electrification, and electrostatic induction of the proposed smart mask are effective in inactivating the span of virus-ladden aerosols in a bidirectional way. Five pairs of triboseries fabrics i.e. nylon - polyester, cotton - polyester, poly(methyl methacrylate) - PVDF, lylon - PVDF and polypropylene - polyester have been optimized in this study in terms of their effective tribo-electric charge densities as 83.13, 211.48, 38.62, 69 and 74.25 nC/m2, respectively.

A literature search of the MEDLINE database and hand-search of Cochrane Database of systematic reviews retrieved 1,423 unique studies, and eight studies were included in this scoping review. Four studies examined a target population with ventilator-related pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, while the other four studies included patients who were at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia. Interventions included intravenous vitamin C, intramuscular vitamin D, enteral and intramuscular vitamin E, enteral zinc sulfate, and oral and parenteral glutamine. In six of the eight included studies, baseline status of the nutrient of interest was not reported and, thus, it is uncertain how outcomes may vary in the context of nutrient deficiency or insufficiency compared to sufficiency.

China is now using its hard-gained experience to support the fight against Ebola in Africa and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in its own country.","publish_time":"2016-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Pengfei; Cai, Zelang; Hua, Jinwen; Yu, Weijia; Chen, Jiajie; Kang, Kang; Qiu, Congling; Ye, Lanlan; Hu, Jiayun; Ji, Kunmei","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a0f2ecf39a72ca6067517375a485d98b308e2aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4971293.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27525272/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/5717108","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China","Africa","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["control system","H7N9 virus","China\u0027s infectious disease prevention system","H5N1 virus","unified public health emergency management system","emerging virus outbreaks","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","SARS tragedy","Chinese government","enduring government administration reforms","severe acute respiratory syndrome","rapid-response infectious diseases prevention","H7N9 avian flu epidemics","legislation","subsequent H1N1","faults","Africa","establishment","drug production","Ebola","better combating","coronavirus","areas of pathogen identification","biomedicine industrialization","funding","Cov","development of vaccines","reinforcing components","recent decades","experience","biotechnology","fight","country","investment","diagnostics"],"language":"en"},

Numerous severe forms of the infection have been described that put emphasis on the lack of efficient antiviral therapy. Among the virus-encoded enzymes, nsP2 constitutes an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. It is a multifunctional protein of approximately 90kDa with a helicase motif in the N-terminal portion of the protein while the papain-like protease activity resides in the C-terminal portion. The nsP2 proteinase is an essential enzyme whose proteolytic activity is critical for virus replication. In this work, a recombinant CHIKV nsP2pro and a C-terminally truncated variant were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by metal\u2013chelate chromatography. The enzymatic properties of the proteinase were then determined using specific synthetic fluorogenic substrates.

The use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in these patients is controversial, as the aerosol dispersion may contaminate the environment and health-care co-workers. METHODS: Describe the respiratory profile, the mortality rate, and the benefit of using NIV in patients with confirmed diagnosis of influenza AH1N1 who were admitted in the ICU during the year 2009. RESULTS: A total of 1, 401 cases of influenza A H1N1 were confirmed in our hospital by real-time RT-PCR in 2009, and 20 patients were admitted to the ICU. The patients\u0027 ages ranged from 18 to 74 years (median of 42). Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) was present in 70% of patients. The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 7 (range 7 to 25). Of the 14 patients who developed ARF, 85.7% needed NIV and 14% needed invasive MV at admission. Our success rate (41.6%) with NIV was higher than that described by others. The hospital mortality rate was 2.1%. When influenza A H1N1 arrived in Brazil, the disease was already on endemic alert in other countries. The population was already aware of the symptoms and the health-care system of the treatment. This allowed patients to be properly and promptly treated for influenza A H1N1, while health-care workers took protective measures to avoid contamination.

By real-time RT-PCR analysis of 986 biological samples collected from cattle herd with clinical signs suggestive of pestivirus infection and from animals recruited in a pestivirus surveillance programme, 165 pestivirus positive samples were detected, including 6 specimens, 2 nasal swabs, and 4 EDTA\u2013blood samples, that tested negative by a gel-based RT-PCR assay targeting the 5\u2032UTR. The developed TaqMan assay represents a new reliable and effective tool for rapid and sensitive diagnosis of infections caused by all pestiviruses circulating in cattle, thus being useful for extensive surveillance programs in geographic areas where HoBi-like pestiviruses are co-circulating with BVDV-1 and BVDV-2.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Losurdo, Michele; Mari, Viviana; Lucente, Maria Stella; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Padalino, Iolanda; Cavaliere, Nicola; Buonavoglia, Canio; Decaro, Nicola","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3429fc8d234966efe5bdd556a9cc2bfd0f7ee5e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113749.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.08.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609341500289X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609341500289X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26300370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EDTA","BVDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BVDV","real-time RT-PCR assay","developed TaqMan assay","gel-based RT-PCR assay","pestivirus positive samples","real-time RT-PCR analysis","sensitive detection of pestiviruses infecting cattle","cattle herd","pestivirus surveillance programme","biological samples","blood samples","TaqMan technology","emerging HoBi","co-circulating","clinical signs suggestive of pestivirus infection","extensive surveillance programs","sensitive diagnosis of infections","copies of viral RNA","bovine viral diarrhea virus","effective tool","geographic areas","animals","EDTA","nasal swabs","specimens","UTR"],"language":"en"},

P-eIF2\u03B1 inhibits eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor that recycles inactive eIF2\u2022GDP to active eIF2\u2022GTP. eIF2 phosphorylation thereby represses translation. Persistent activation of the ISR has been linked to the development of several neurological disorders, and modulation of the ISR promises new therapeutic strategies. Recently, a small-molecule ISR inhibitor (ISRIB) was identified that rescues translation in the presence of P-eIF2\u03B1 by facilitating the assembly of more active eIF2B. ISRIB enhances cognitive memory processes and has therapeutic effects in brain-injured mice without displaying overt side effects. While using ISRIB to investigate the ISR in picornavirus-infected cells, we observed that ISRIB rescued translation early in infection when P-eIF2\u03B1 levels were low, but not late in infection when P-eIF2\u03B1 levels were high. By treating cells with varying concentrations of poly(I:C) or arsenite to induce the ISR, we provide additional proof that ISRIB is unable to inhibit the ISR when intracellular P-eIF2\u03B1 concentrations exceed a critical threshold level. Together, our data demonstrate that the effects of pharmacological activation of eIF2B are tuned by P-eIF2\u03B1 concentration. Thus, ISRIB can mitigate undesirable outcomes of low-level ISR activation that may manifest neurological disease but leaves the cytoprotective effects of acute ISR activation intact. The insensitivity of cells to ISRIB during acute ISR may explain why ISRIB does not cause overt toxic side effects in vivo.","publish_time":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rabouw, Huib H.; Langereis, Martijn A.; Anand, Aditya A.; Visser, Linda J.; de Groot, Raoul J.; Walter, Peter; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.

High\u2010throughput, accurate, broad\u2010range tools for etiologic diagnosis are critical for effective epidemic control. In this study, the diagnostic capacities of an Ibis platform based on the PCR/ESI\u2010MS assay were evaluated using clinical samples. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from 120 children (\u003C5 years old) who were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections between November 2010 and October 2011. The respiratory virus detection assay was performed using the PCR/ESI\u2010MS assay and the DFA. The discordant PCR/ESI\u2010MS and DFA results were resolved with RT\u2010PCR plus sequencing. The overall agreement for PCR/ESI\u2010MS and DFA was 98.3% (118/120). Compared with the results from DFA, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR/ESI\u2010MS assay were 100% and 97.5%, respectively. The PCR/ESI\u2010MS assay also detected more multiple virus infections and revealed more detailed subtype information than DFA. Among the 12 original specimens with discordant results between PCR/ESI\u2010MS and DFA, 11 had confirmed PCR/ESI\u2010MS results. Thus, the PCR/ESI\u2010MS assay is a high\u2010throughput, sensitive, specific and promising method to detect and subtype conventional viruses in respiratory tract infections and allows rapid identification of mixed pathogens.

This is the case in Italy, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic. Given the heightened fear concerning COVID-19 in Italy., the present study analyzed the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). METHODS: The sample comprised 250 Italian participants who were administered Italian versions of the FCV-19S, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Severity Measure for Specific Phobia\u2013Adult (SMSP-A). Several psychometric tests were performed to investigate the validity and reliability of the test including confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of the data showed satisfactory psychometric characteristics and confirmed the scale\u2019s unidimensional properties. The seven FCV-19S items had acceptable correlations with the test total (from .443 to .784). Furthermore, the loadings on the factor were significant and strong (from .684 to .897). The internal consistency was very good (\u03B1 = .871). Construct validity for the FCV-19S was supported by significant and positive correlations with the HADS (r=.649) and SMSP-A (r=.703). CONCLUSIONS: The Italian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale is valid and reliable in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general Italian population.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soraci, Paolo; Ferrari, Ambra; Abbiati, Francesco A.; Del Fante, Elena; De Pace, Rosanna; Urso, Antonino; Griffiths, Mark D.","journal":"Int J Ment Health Addict","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/710565d476b4567a945b323a4dc21cd3adf482ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198091.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372892/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00277-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HADS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Fear of COVID","FCV","Italian versions","Italian participants","advent of COVID","heightened fear","psychometric properties","S items","general Italian population","HADS","Depression Scale","psychometric tests","Italy","SMSP","satisfactory psychometric characteristics","confirmatory factor analysis","acceptable correlations","positive correlations","test total","Hospital Anxiety","Construct validity","scale\u2019s unidimensional properties","Specific Phobia","Adult","Severity Measure","data","people\u2019s health","reliability","present study","internal consistency","consequences","sample","countries","RESULTS","loadings","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","pandemic","case"],"language":"en"},

The reduction of this inflammatory immune-response could be considered as a potential therapeutic target against severe COVID-19. The relationship between inflammation and clot activation must also be considered. Furthermore, we must keep in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS-CoV-2. While moderate-severe forms need in-hospital surveillance plus antivirals and/or hydroxychloroquine; in severe and life-threating subsets a high intensity anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy could be a therapeutic option.

Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are similar to short single-stranded DNA oligomers, but possess a modified backbone that confers highly specific binding and resistance to nucleases. In this study, RTA and LANA mRNA in PEL cells were targeted by antisense peptide-conjugated PMO (P-PMO) in an effort to suppress KSHV replication. Highly efficient P-PMO uptake by PEL cells was observed. Treatment of PEL cells with a RTA P-PMO (RP1) reduced RTA expression in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner. There was also a significant decrease in several KSHV early and late gene products, including vIL-6, vIRF-1, and ORF-K8.1A. KSHV viral DNA levels were reduced both in cells and culture supernatants of RP1 P-PMO-treated cells, which indicate that KSHV lytic replication was supressed.

Current submission guidelines for surgical conferences and journals were analyzed for data release embargos and social media use policies. RESULTS: Conference abstract guidelines mentioned data embargos half of the time and the use of social media less than one third of the time. Eighty percentage of journal instructions to authors contained guidelines on both. CONCLUSIONS: In nonsurgical fields, the appropriateness of the use of social media to release prepublication data is increasingly being discussed. Little guidance exists on how surgical conference attendees should use social media while at conferences.

METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peeri, Noah C; Shrestha, Nistha; Rahman, Md Siddikur; Zaki, Rafdzah; Tan, Zhengqi; Bibi, Saana; Baghbanzadeh, Mahdi; Aghamohammadi, Nasrin; Zhang, Wenyi; Haque, Ubydul","journal":"Int J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02dba87a4db7b81555e49f836832297dbe6b2d4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197734.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32086938/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Middle East","East"],"keyphrases":["West of China","mainland China","rapid spread of COVID","Wuhan","risk factors","spread of infection","transmission methods","protection methods","Inadequate risk assessment","MERS","deadly coronavirus outbreaks","SARS","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","current novel coronavirus","major deadly coronaviruses","prior epidemics of coronavirus","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","large hub","critical assessment","Future research","major international airport","massive rail transit hub","improvement of future preparedness plans","areas","diagnosis","Prevention","symptoms","treatment","railways","South","New Year","initial reports","Chinese","things","website","information","USA","CDC","clinical signs","Disease Control","technologies","IoT","North","urgency","comprehensive review of PubMed literature","implications of internet","limited reporting","actionable items","timing","Lunar","situation","Centers","overview","challenges","distant countries","flights","RESULTS","availability","globalization","focus","lessons","Comparisons","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In group 4, lambs with cryptosporidiosis were subjected to normal feeding as control without drug administration. Clinical examinations of lambs were made before treatment (day 0) and on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after treatment and 5 ml of blood was collected from vena jugularis for blood analysis of all lambs. Weight changes of lambs were recorded at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days.

Although the pathogenesis of ZIKV-associated neurological complications has been reported in recent studies, key questions on the pathogenesis of the other clinical manifestations, non-vector-borne transmission and potential animal reservoirs of ZIKV remain unanswered. We systematically characterized the differential cell line susceptibility of 18 human and 15 nonhuman cell lines to two ZIKV isolates (human and primate) and dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). Productive ZIKV replication (\u2A7E2 log increase in viral load, ZIKV nonstructural protein-1 (NS1) protein expression and cytopathic effects (CPE)) was found in the placental (JEG-3), neuronal (SF268), muscle (RD), retinal (ARPE19), pulmonary (Hep-2 and HFL), colonic (Caco-2),and hepatic (Huh-7) cell lines. These findings helped to explain the trans-placental transmission and other clinical manifestations of ZIKV. Notably, the prostatic (LNCaP), testicular (833KE) and renal (HEK) cell lines showed increased ZIKV load and/or NS1 protein expression without inducing CPE, suggesting their potential roles in sexual transmission with persistent viral replication at these anatomical sites. Comparatively, none of the placental and genital tract cell lines allowed efficient DENV-2 replication. Among the nonhuman cell lines, nonhuman primate (Vero and LLC-MK2), pig (PK-15), rabbit (RK-13), hamster (BHK21) and chicken (DF-1) cell lines supported productive ZIKV replication. These animal species may be important reservoirs and/or potential animal models for ZIKV. The findings in our study help to explain the viral shedding pattern, transmission and pathogenesis of the rapidly disseminating ZIKV, and are useful for optimizing laboratory diagnostics and studies on the pathogenesis and counter-measures of ZIKV.","publish_time":"2016-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Tsang, Jessica Oi-Ling; Tee, Kah-Meng; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chik, Kenn Ka-Heng; Zhu, Zheng; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Choi, Garnet Kwan-Yue; Sridhar, Siddharth; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Lu, Gang; Chiu, Kin; Lo, Amy Cheuk-Yin; Tsao, Sai-Wah; Kok, Kin-Hang; Jin, Dong-Yan; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2782e0d4147b59228cff660820bf0b65c3417187.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5034105.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.99; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27553173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of ZIKV","ZIKV isolates","Productive ZIKV replication","nonhuman cell lines","ZIKV nonstructural protein","clinical manifestations of ZIKV","human transmission","increased ZIKV load","potential animal reservoirs of ZIKV","genital tract cell lines","trans-placental transmission","sexual human","sexual transmission","persistent viral replication","viral load","nonhuman primate","differential cell line susceptibility","NS1 protein expression","human-pathogenic flaviviruses","potential animal models","potential roles","CPE","animal species","findings","viral shedding pattern","important reservoirs","recent studies","efficient DENV","Zika virus","dengue virus type","congenital anomalies","association","log increase","Vero","HEK","non-vector","LLC-MK2","cytopathic effects","neurological complications","HFL","muscle","RD","ARPE19","chicken","laboratory diagnostics","key questions","anatomical sites","DF","counter-measures","Caco","hamster","LNCaP","PK","SF268","BHK21","pig","study","RK","rabbit","JEG","hepatic"],"language":"en"},

In many countries, the global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has led to overloaded healthcare systems due to large numbers of COVID-19 patients. In order to provide care to this high volume of patients, far-reaching measures are taken that affect everyone.

A key feature of FIPV, not shared with FECV, is the productive infection of macrophages. Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell tropism, such as the spike glycoprotein, may play an important role in FIP progression. In a prior study, involving a limited number of samples, we have shown an association of FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation site located between the receptor-binding and fusion domains of the FCoV spike (S1/S2). Here, we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and to obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1/S2 site. Our larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by FIPV at S1/S2 are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease cleavage-activation site located in the fusion domain (S2\u0027), adjacent to the viral fusion peptide. Overall, our data indicate a pattern of mutations across the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions, and/or altered recognition, of critical basic/polar amino acid residues needed for virus activation in the enteric tract. Typically, FIPVs have substitutions of non-polar, aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites. These changes likely modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its ability to productively infect macrophages in vivo.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Licitra, Beth N.; Sams, Kelly L.; Lee, Donald W.; R.Whittaker, Gary","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f0072340bfb707caeebd129ecd30711841b613a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4034v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["additional mutations","pattern of mutations","virus activation","S2 site","protease cleavage-activation site","protease recognition sites","feline coronavirus","S1","proteolytic activation","lethal feline infectious peritonitis virus","subclinical feline enteric coronavirus","FECV","FCoV spike","fusion domains","altered recognition","FIP progression","association of FIP","larger data set","substitutions of non-polar","viral fusion peptide","larger sample set","key feature of FIPV","aromatic residues","polar amino acid residues","spike glycoprotein","enteric tract","productive infection of macrophages","receptor-binding","important role","cell tropism","limited number of samples","prior study","studies","FIPVs","proteins","refined analysis","genome","ability","changes"],"language":"en"},

The present in silico study was designed to evaluate the effect of Jensenone, a essential oil component from eucalyptus oil, on Mpro by docking study. In the present study, molecular docking studies were conducted by using 1-click dock and swiss dock tools. Protein interaction mode was calculated by Protein Interactions Calculator.The calculated parameters such as binding energy, and binding site similarity indicated effective binding of Jensenone to COVID-19 proteinase. Active site prediction further validated the role of active site residues in ligand binding.

Consequently, there is an active debate regarding the critical socio-economic determinants that contribute to the resulting pandemic. In this paper, we contribute towards the resolution of the debate by leveraging Bayesian model averaging techniques and country level data to investigate the potential of 29 determinants, describing a diverse set of socio-economic characteristics, in explaining the coronavirus pandemic outcome. We show that the true empirical model behind the coronavirus outcome is constituted only of few determinants, but the extent to which each determinant is able to provide a credible explanation varies between countries due to their heterogeneous socio-economic characteristics. To understand the relationship between the potential determinants in the specification of the true model, we develop the coronavirus determinants Jointness space. In this space, two determinants are connected with each other if they are able to jointly explain the coronavirus outcome. As constructed, the obtained map acts as a bridge between theoretical investigations and empirical observations, and offers an alternate view for the joint importance of the socio-economic determinants when used for developing policies aimed at preventing future epidemic crises.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stojkoski, Viktor; Utkovski, Zoran; Jolakoski, Petar; Tevdovski, Dragan; Kocarev, Ljupco","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1b7341e4295f846ad44de180d5e9c87556d1ff4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07947v6.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential determinants","coronavirus outcome","critical socio-economic determinants","coronavirus disease","coronavirus determinants Jointness space","coronavirus pandemic outcome","true model","true empirical model","heterogeneous socio-economic characteristics","diverse set of socio-economic characteristics","extent","resulting pandemic","Bayesian model averaging techniques","multitude of social","social life","empirical observations","active debate","economic activities","economic criteria","country level data","bridge","theoretical investigations","countries","policies","joint importance","alternate view","obtained map acts","epidemiological factors","enormous impact","COVID","specification","credible explanation","future epidemic crises","resolution","magnitude","population","relationship","paper","world"],"language":"en"},

With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques (RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity. Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further, we propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients using X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology scalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural network based model to triage patients for appropriate testing. On the publicly available covid-chestxray-dataset [2], our model gives 90.5% accuracy with 100% sensitivity (recall) for the COVID-19 infection.

Here, we perform a large-scale comparison of perceptual IQA models in terms of their use as objectives for the optimization of image processing algorithms. Specifically, we evaluate eleven full-reference IQA models by using them as objective functions to train deep neural networks for four low-level vision tasks: denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and compression. Extensive subjective testing on the optimized images allows us to rank the competing models in terms of their perceptual performance, elucidate their relative advantages and disadvantages for these tasks, and propose a set of desirable properties for incorporation into future IQA models.

During such outbreaks, understanding the emotional state of citizens of a country could be of interest to various organizations to carry out tasks and to take necessary measures. Several studies have been performed on data available on various social media platforms and websites to understand the emotions of people against many events, inclusive of Covid-19, across the world. Twitter and other social media platforms have been bridging the gap between the citizens and government in various countries and are of more prominence in India. Sentiment Analysis of posts on twitter is observed to accurately reveal the sentiments. Analysing real time posts on twitter in India during Covid-19, could help in identifying the mood of the nation. However, most of the existing studies related to Covid-19, on twitter and other social media platforms are performed on data posted during a specific interval. We are not aware of any research that identifies emotional state of India on a daily basis. Hence, we present a web portal that aims to display mood of India during Covid-19, based on real time twitter data. This portal also enables users to select date range, specific date and state in India to display mood of people belonging to the specified region, on the specified date or during the specified date range. Also, the number of Covid-19 cases and mood of people at specific cities and states on specific dates is visualized on the country map. As of May 6 2020, the web portal has about 194370 tweets, and each of these tweets are classified into seven categories that include six basic emotions and a neutral category.

We explore the question of whether this represents exponentially decaying dynamics or is simply an artefact of India\u0027s testing strategy. Testing has largely been limited to individuals travelling from high-risk countries and their immediate contacts, meaning that the network reflects positive identifications from a biased testing sample. Given generally low levels of testing and an almost complete absence of testing for community spread, there is significant risk that we may be missing out on the actual nature of outbreak. India still has an apparently low current caseload, with possibly a small window of time to act, and should therefore aggressively and systematically expand random testing for community spread, including for asymptomatic cases.

They are applied to study the spreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD-19, where the counting of the cumulated number $N(t)$ of detected infected individuals is a generally accepted, coarse-grain, variable to understand the epidemic phase. However $N(t)$ does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic, not detected, cases $A(t)$. Therefore, the question arises if the observed time series of data of $N(t)$ is a reliable tool for monitoring the evolution of the infectious disease. We study a system of coupled differential equations which includes the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and the strong containment effects due to the social isolation. The solution is therefore compared with a macroscopic law for the population $N(t)$ coming from a single, non-linear, differential equation with no explicit reference to $A(t)$, showing the equivalence of the two methods. Indeed, $N(t)$ takes into account a more complex and detailed population dynamics which permits the evaluation of the number of asymptomatic individuals also. The model is then applied to Covid-19 spreading in Italy where a transition from an exponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for $N(t)$ has been observed in more recent data. Then the information contained in the data analysis of $N(t)$ is reliable to understand the epidemic phase, although it does not describe the total infected population. The asymptomatic population is larger than the symptomatic one in the fast growth phase of the spreading.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"D.Lanteri,; D.Carco\u0027,; P.Castorina,","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c156ac987693e4312f83947086c96fcaba34f0f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12457v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic population","number of asymptomatic individuals","detailed population dynamics","unknown number of asymptomatic","epidemic phase","spreading of infections","fast growth phase","detected infected individuals","total infected population","Gompertz growth","Macroscopic growth laws","differential equations","underlying complex dynamics","data analysis","cumulated number","account","recent data","observed time series of data","macroscopic law","reliable tool","case of CoviD","solutions of mean field equations","strong containment effects","evaluation","effective way","exponential behavior","explicit reference","evolution","variable","counting","social isolation","transition","Italy","question","coarse-grain","infectious disease","information","system","equivalence","cases","methods","model"],"language":"en"},

One of the most important tasks during a pandemic is to bring awareness among people. Bringing awareness contributes a lot in controlling any pandemic. Covid-19 has been causing severe loss to the human race. Considering the mode of spread and the level of severity of this disease, it is extremely important to make people aware of various safety precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining social distancing, that are to be followed to prevent the disease and break the chain of spread. This mode of educating individuals about the disease is being widely carried out as announcements through online or physical awareness campaigns, advertisements in the media and so on. The younger generations in the present day spend considerably more time on mobile phones and games. However, there are very few mobile applications or games, aimed to bring awareness about a pandemic, which is much lesser in case of Covid-19. Also, considering the lockdown scenario across the world, games also act as a good pass time indoors. Hence, we propose a 2D survival based game, SurviveCovid-19, aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid-19 outside their homes, by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an Android based mobile game and has been evaluated through a remote qualitative user survey, with 20 volunteers. The results of the survey are promising with all the questions of survey having mean value greater than 3.6.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Venigalla, Akhila Sri Manasa; Vagavolu, Dheeraj; Chimalakonda, Sridhar","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32e44618d02320b50abcfe2545488a26a80df432.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09759v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["games","mobile game","disease","sanitizers","questions of survey","social distancing","physical awareness campaigns","human race","mobile phones","mobile applications","case of Covid","mode","SurviveCovid","people aware of various safety precautions","usage of masks","remote qualitative user survey","important tasks","chain of spread","good pass time","advertisements","present day","mean value greater","announcements","severe loss","younger generations","lockdown scenario","world","volunteers","media","D survival","homes","level of severity","Pandemics","times","individuals","Android","lot","results"],"language":"en"},

To curb the secondary spread of the epidemic, many public places were equipped with thermal imagers to check the body temperature. However, the COVID-19 pneumonia has concealed symptoms: the first symptom may not be fever, and can be shortness of breath. During epidemic prevention, many people tend to wear masks. Therefore, in this demo paper, we proposed a portable non-contact healthy screening system for people wearing masks, which can simultaneously obtain body temperature and respiration state. This system consists of three modules viz. thermal image collection module, health indicator calculation module and health assessment module. In this system, the thermal video of human faces is first captured through a portable thermal imaging camera. Then, body temperature and respiration state are extracted from the video and are imported into the following health assessment module. Finally, the screening result can be obtained. The results of preliminary experiments show that this syetem can give an accurate screening result within 15 seconds. This system can be applied to many application scenarios such as community and campus.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Zheng; Hu, Menghan; Zhai, Guangtao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de1b763b6df4709c4de89ef15cf9a7127ca1c9a1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01479v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["body temperature","following health assessment module","health indicator calculation module","thermal image collection module","thermal imagers","portable non-contact healthy screening system","portable thermal imaging camera","people","thermal video of human faces","accurate screening result","respiration state","masks","epidemic prevention","COVID","public health emergency of international concern","public places","syetem","modules","application scenarios","community","campus","symptoms","seconds","results of preliminary experiments","demo paper","secondary spread","fever","pneumonia","shortness of breath"],"language":"en"},

We use a in-house numerical code to solve the governing transport equations for the velocities and flow rates in a rotating channel subjected to an applied external electric field. We show the strong effect of polyelectrolyte layer on the flow behaviour and find an increase in flow rate as we increase the size of the polyelectrolyte layer. We also show that rheology strongly influences the interplay of the Coriolis forces due to rotation and electrical body force due to the applied electric field. We show that the velocities are generally higher for shear thinning fluids as compared to shear thickening fluids. We also show that presence of polymer brushes in the polyelectrolyte layer creates a drag on the fluid which reduces velocities. We also show that the flow rates are strongly altered by the effect of rotation and that shear thickening fluids have lower flow rates than shear thinning fluids. We believe that studying effect of fluid rheology becomes very important for designing soft channel based Lab-on-CD systems driven by electroosmotic forcing and dealing with rheologically complex bio-fluids such as blood, saliva or mucus.","publish_time":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Maneesh; Kruthiventi, S S Harish; Kaushik, P","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09079v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["thickening fluids","rotating electroosmotic flow","law fluids","lower flow rates","shear","flow behaviour of power","velocities","rheologically complex bio-fluids","strong effect of polyelectrolyte layer","evergrowing importance of understanding flow of bio","rotating channel","soft channel","effect of rotation","effect of fluid rheology","Lab","CD systems","applied electric field","narrow channel","CD based systems","increase","applied external electric field","electroosmotic forcing","electrical body force","governing transport equations","blood","Coriolis forces","in-house numerical code","drag","size","presence of polymer brushes","interplay","saliva","mucus"],"language":"en"},

Since proximity data can be collected by personal mobile devices, the natural proposal has been to use this for contact tracing as this provides a major gain over a manual implementation. In this work, we study the characteristics of automated contact tracing and its effectiveness for mapping the spread of a pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and social structures required for automated contact tracing to work for the current pandemic. We display the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequately sample the population, which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold. We conclude that a strong reliance on contact tracing to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can lead to the potential danger of allowing the pandemic to spread unchecked. A carefully thought out strategy for controlling the spread of the pandemic along with automated contact tracing can lead to an optimal solution.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyunju; Paul, Ayan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76a60acde56f490dd6f92f9925bcf7f6a507e455.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10762v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["characteristics of automated contact tracing","significant contact","spread of SARS","spread of COVID","current pandemic","SARS-CoV","population","strategy","work","significant fraction","personal mobile devices","social structures","major gain","natural proposal","participation","effectiveness","manual implementation","infrastructure","infected individuals","potential danger","inability","strong reliance","proximity data","optimal solution","crucial importance","advocated solutions","minimum threshold","vulnerabilities"],"language":"en"},

Temporal patterns in human behaviour as measured by mobile phone data -- or why chose Thursdays","doi":null,"pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"arxiv","abstract":"Mobile phone data -- with file sizes scaling into terabytes -- easily overwhelm the computational capacity available to some researchers. Moreover, for ethical reasons, data access is often granted only to particular subsets, restricting analyses to cover single days, weeks, or geographical areas. Consequently, it is frequently impossible to set a particular analysis or event in its context and know how typical it is, compared to other days, weeks or months. This is important for academic referees questioning research on mobile phone data and for the analysts in deciding how to sample, how much data to process, and which events are anomalous. All these issues require an understanding of variability in Big Data to answer the question of how average is average? This paper provides a method, using a large mobile phone dataset, to answer these basic but necessary questions. We show that file size is a robust proxy for the activity level of phone users by profiling the temporal variability of the data at an hourly, daily and monthly level. We then apply time-series analysis to isolate temporal periodicity. Finally, we discuss confidence limits to anomalous events in the data. We recommend an analytical approach to mobile phone data selection which suggests that ideally data should be sampled across days, across working weeks, and across the year, to obtain a representative average. However, where this is impossible, the temporal variability is such that specific weekdays\u0027 data can provide a fair picture of other days in their general structure.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toger, Marina; Shuttleworth, Ian; Osth, John","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d79b8aea0889559a145168aae3ffb2758cc2fbf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00137v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Big Data"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["data access","Big Data","mobile phone data selection","specific weekdays\u0027 data","temporal variability","large mobile phone dataset","single days","activity level of phone users","understanding of variability","particular analysis","temporal periodicity","working weeks","anomalous events","representative average","particular subsets","monthly level","file sizes scaling","time-series analysis","robust proxy","academic referees","analyses","fair picture","analytical approach","terabytes","context","year","method","hourly","confidence limits","geographical areas","computational capacity available","researchers","ethical reasons","process","analysts","general structure","necessary questions","issues","months","paper"],"language":"en"},

Here, we argue that the effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation is likely underestimated by existing studies because they do not take into account the different forms of heterogeneity and sampling biases from the network structure. Specifically, we show that contact tracing can be even more effective than acquaintance sampling at locating hubs. Our results call for the need for contact tracing to go both backward and forward, in multiple steps, to leverage all forms of positive biases. Using simulations on networks with a power-law degree distribution, we show that this deep contact tracing can potentially prevent almost all further transmissions even at a small probability of detecting infected individuals. We also show that, when the number of traced contacts is small, the number of prevented transmission per traced node is even higher---although most traced individuals are healthy---than that from case isolation without contact tracing. Our results also have important consequences for new implementations of digital contact tracing and we argue backward and deep tracing can be incorporated without the important sacrificing privacy-preserving requirements of these new platforms.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kojaku, Sadamori; H\u0027ebert-Dufresne, Laurent; Ahn, Yong-Yeol","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02362v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deep contact tracing","effectiveness of contact tracing","deep tracing","new implementations of digital contact tracing","traced individuals","Case isolation","number of traced contacts","sampling biases","traced node","results","forms of positive biases","important consequences","small probability","acquaintance sampling","new platforms","infected individuals","number of prevented transmission","different forms of heterogeneity","important sacrificing privacy","requirements","power-law degree distribution","networks","intervention method","network structure","epidemic outbreaks","hubs","account","multiple steps","need","simulations","transmissions","existing studies"],"language":"en"},

This modified gravity scenario introduces a fifth force between dark matter particles, mediated by a scalar field that plays the role of dark energy. The mass of the dark matter particles does not remain constant, but changes with time as a function of the scalar field. Here we focus on the phenomenological behavior of the model, and assess its ability to describe updated cosmological data sets that include the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, polarization and lensing, baryon acoustic oscillations, the Pantheon compilation of supernovae of Type Ia, data on $H(z)$ from cosmic chronometers, and redshift-space distortions. We also study which is the impact of the local measurement of $H_0$ from SH0ES and the strong-lensing time delay data from the H0LICOW collaboration on the parameter that controls the strength of the interaction in the dark sector. We find a peak corresponding to a coupling $\\beta\u003E0$ and to a potential parameter $\\alpha\u003E0$, more or less evident depending on the data set combination. We show separately the impact of each data set and remark that it is especially CMB lensing the one data set that shifts the peak the most towards $\\Lambda$CDM. When a model selection criterion based on the full Bayesian evidence is applied, however, $\\Lambda$CDM is still preferred in all cases, due to the additional parameters introduced in the CDE model.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u0027omez-Valent, Adria; Pettorino, Valeria; Amendola, Luca","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8127c3bc0a1777bc5c815a803f9bd24cfb690935.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00610v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMB","CDE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["data set combination","dark matter particles","dark sector","role of dark energy","strong-lensing time delay data","updated cosmological data sets","CDE model","CMB","constant coupling strength","potential parameter","scalar field","impact","beta","CDM","Lambda","model selection criterion","cosmic chronometers","updated constraints","peak corresponding","cosmic microwave background","polarization","temperature","PR","Planck","Pantheon compilation of supernovae","baryon acoustic oscillations","Peebles-Ratra","Type Ia","force","cosmology","H0LICOW collaboration","ability","additional parameters","function","SH0ES","remark","redshift-space distortions","modified gravity scenario","cases","local measurement","changes","interaction","mass","Bayesian evidence","work","phenomenological behavior","alpha"],"language":"en"},

I used an E. coli in vitro translation system to analyze the mechanism of this frameshifting event. In this system, gamma was produced almost to the same extent as the inframe translation product, tau, suggesting that efficient frameshifting was reproduced in vitro. Coupling with transcription was not necessary for frameshifting. Addition of purified tau or gamma had no effect on the frameshifting process suggesting the absence of direct feedback regulation. By use of mutant genes, a strong pausing site was identified at or very close to the frameshift site. This pausing was apparently caused by a potential stem-loop structure which was previously shown to enhance frameshifting. Thus, enhancement of frameshifting by this putative stem-loop seems to be mediated by the translation pausing at the frameshift site. Despite the apparent structural similarity of the dnaX frameshift site to that of the eukaryotic retroviral genes, dnaX mRNA synthesized in vitro failed to direct the production of gamma in eukaryotic translation systems. This suggests that frameshifting in the dnaX gene depends on components specific to the E. coli translation system.","publish_time":"1991-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsuchihashi, Z","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329457/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["Escherichia"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficient frameshifting","frameshifting process","enhancement of frameshifting","frameshifting event","dnaX frameshift site","coli translation system","dnaX gene","production of gamma","eukaryotic translation systems","strong pausing site","dnaX mRNA","inframe translation product","gamma subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase","eukaryotic retroviral genes","putative stem-loop","potential stem-loop structure","efficient translational frameshif","use of mutant genes","Addition of purified tau","absence of direct feedback regulation","holoenzyme","components specific","effect","apparent structural similarity","mechanism","extent","transcription"],"language":"en"},

By this approach, juxtaposed putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, nucleic acid binding (\u0022finger\u0022-like) and RNA helicase domains were identified in F2. Together, these domains might constitute the core of the protein complex involved in the primer-dependent transcription, replication and recombination of coronaviruses. In F1, two cysteine protease-like domains and a growth factor-like one were revealed. One of the putative proteases of IBV is similar to 3C proteases of picornaviruses and related enzymes of como- nepo- and potyviruses. Search of IBV F1 and F2 sequences for sites similar to those cleaved by the latter proteases and intercomparison of the surrounding sequence stretches revealed 13 dipeptides Q/S(G) which are probably cleaved by the coronavirus 3C-like protease. Based on these observations, a partial tentative scheme for the functional organization and expression strategy of the non-structural polyproteins of IBV was proposed. It implies that, despite the general similarity to other positive strand RNA viruses, and particularly to potyviruses, coronaviruses possess a number of unique structural and functional features.","publish_time":"1989-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gorbalenya, A E; Koonin, E V; Donchenko, A P; Blinov, V M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC318036/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["F2 sequences","RNA helicase domains","putative proteases of IBV","juxtaposed putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","non-structural polyproteins of IBV","Search of IBV F1","positive strand RNA viral","positive strand RNA viruses","Amino acid sequences","C proteases of picornaviruses","potyviruses","giant non-structural polyproteins","functional organization","sites similar","functional features","recombination of coronaviruses","cysteine protease","primer-dependent transcription","nucleic acid binding","number of unique structural","expression strategy","related enzymes of como","partial tentative scheme","dipeptides Q","surrounding sequence","replication","cellular proteins","infectious bronchitis virus","general similarity","nepo","finger","approach","protein complex","observations","core","computer","intercomparison","member of Coronaviridae","methods","growth factor"],"language":"en"},

We report a case of COVID-19 infection in a 64-year-old man who developed rapidly worsening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that required intubation. As the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges widely from mild illness to ARDS with a high risk of mortality, there is a need for more research to identify early markers of disease severity. Current evidence suggests that patients with advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities or dyspnoea should be closely monitored, especially at 1-2 weeks after symptom onset. It remains to be seen if laboratory findings such as lymphopenia or elevated lactate dehydrogenase may serve as early surrogates for critical illness or markers of disease recovery. Management of ARDS in COVID-19 remains supportive while we await results of drug trials. More studies are needed to understand the incidence and outcomes of ARDS and critical illness from COVID-19, which will be important for critical care management and resource planning.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goh, Ken J; Choong, Mindy Cm; Cheong, Elizabeth Ht; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Duu Wen, Sewa; Phua, Ghee Chee; Chan, Kian Sing; Haja Mohideen, Salahudeen","journal":"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32200400/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["critical illness","Management of ARDS","case of COVID","outcomes of ARDS","clinical spectrum of COVID","mild illness","critical care management","early markers of disease severity","markers of disease recovery","coronavirus disease","early surrogates","worsening respiratory failure","acute respiratory distress syndrome","advanced age","patients","ranges","elevated lactate dehydrogenase","lymphopenia","pre-existing comorbidities","year-old man","resource planning","high risk of mortality","Wuhan","dyspnoea","infection","incidence","research","Hubei province","laboratory findings","Current evidence","China","need","outbreak","results of drug trials","cases","deaths","weeks","symptom onset","intubation","globe","countries","studies"],"language":"en"},

We recommended planning the pregnancy after the achievement of major molecular response and completion of TKI therapy because we could not promise complete safety of the fetus, However, he and his partner insisted on starting the TKI therapy immediately and planned the pregnancy during the therapy. The patient was started on nilotinib 600mg/body. CCyR, MMR, and CMR were achieved in 3, 8, and 12 months, respectively. The patient\u0027s partner got pregnant when he had been on TKI therapy for 15 months, and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Since many patients with CMLcan live for a long time after receiving TKI therapy, the quality of life of these patients is more important. Even if the percentage of patients with CML who are under 50 years of age is approximately 30%, the safety information of TKI with respect to pregnancy is unsatisfactory. Doctors struggle to address the problems of the patient\u0027s wish of childbearing, priority of TKI therapy, and fetal risks of the treatment. Although only a few cases of pregnancy and delivery of the partners of male patients with CML treated with TKI have been reported, all cases showed healthy childbirth and normal child growth.

Methods A Delphi process was initiated among a panel of 12 experts in robot assisted surgery invited through the SERGS. An online questionnaire survey was based on a literature search for standards in education in gynaecological robot assisted surgery. The survey was performed in three consecutive rounds to reach optimal consensus. The results of this survey were discussed by the panel and led to consensus recommendations on 39 issues, adhering to general principles of medical education. Results On review there appeared to be no accredited training programs in Europe, and few in the USA. Recommendations for requirements of training centres, educational tools and assessment of proficiency varied widely. Stepwise and structured training together with validated assessment based on competencies rather than on volume emerged as prerequisites for adequate and safe learning. An appropriate educational environment and tools for training were defined. Although certification should be competence based, the panel recommended additional volume based criteria for both accreditation of training centres and certification of individual surgeons. Conclusions Consensus was reached on minimum criteria for training in robot assisted gynaecological surgery. To transfer results into clinical practice, experts recommended a curriculum and guidelines that have now been endorsed by SERGS to be used to establish training programmes for robot assisted surgery.","publish_time":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rusch, P; Ind, T; Kimmig, R; Maggioni, A; Ponce, J; Zanagnolo, V; Coronado, P J; Verguts, J; Lambaudie, E; Falconer, H; Collins, J W; Verheijen, Rhm","journal":"Facts, views \u0026 vision in ObGyn","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background The Society of European Robotic Gynaecological Surgery"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["structured training","training programmes","gynaecological robot","accreditation of training centres","requirements of training centres","accredited training programs","panel","European consensus","consensus recommendations","SERGS","results","Society of European Robotic Gynaecological Surgery","optimal consensus","Conclusions Consensus","additional volume based criteria","curriculum","educational tools","validated assessment","assessment of proficiency","experts","online questionnaire survey","minimum criteria","appropriate educational environment","certification of individual surgeons","general principles of medical education","literature search","standards","core components","prerequisites","issues","consecutive rounds","clinical practice","safe learning","Delphi process","competence","competencies","Methods","review","guidelines","USA"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN Retrospective study. METHOD Patients with fever with no apparent cause and patients with recently developed respiratory symptoms, whether or not in combination with fever, were routinely given a PCR test, blood tests (lymphocyte count and LDH levels) and a chest CT scan. The CT scan was assessed according to the CO-RADS classification. Based on the findings, the patients were divided into 3 cohorts (proven COVID-19, strong suspicion of COVID-19, and low suspicion of COVID-19) and the appropriate isolation measures were taken. RESULTS In the period from 8 to 31 March 2020, the algorithm was applied to 312 patients. COVID-19 was proven for 69 (22%) patients. COVID-19 was strongly suspected for 151 (48%) patients and suspicion was low for the remaining 92 (29%) patients. The percentage of patients with positive PCR results and the percentage of patients with abnormal laboratory test results increased as the CO-RADS score increased. Among patients with a CO-RADS score of 4 or 5, this percentage increased further when they also had lymphopenia or elevated LDH levels. We have adjusted the flowchart based on our findings. CONCLUSION In case of patients who have been referred to an emergency department for suspected COVID-19, a good COVID-19 risk assessment can be made on the basis of clinical signs, laboratory abnormalities and low-dose CT scans. Even before the results of the PCR test are known and even if the results are negative, patients can be classified as \u0027proven COVID-19 patients\u0027 using the algorithm.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dofferhoff, A S M; Swinkels, A; Sprong, T; Berk, Y; Spanbroek, M; Nabuurs-Franssen, M H; Vermaat, M; van de Kerkhof, B; Willekens, M H C; Voss, A","journal":"Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406638/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["percentage of patients","METHOD Patients","case of patients","proven COVID","suspected COVID","risk of COVID","low suspicion of COVID","good COVID","strong suspicion of COVID","PCR test","positive PCR results","percentage increased","abnormal laboratory test results","CO-RADS score","CO-RADS classification","low-dose CT scans","fever","chest CT scan","diagnostic algorithm","emergency department","findings","elevated LDH levels","laboratory abnormalities","risk assessment","lymphocyte count","blood tests","basis of clinical signs","apparent cause","lymphopenia","OBJECTIVE Evaluation","respiratory symptoms","patients\u0027","cohorts","appropriate isolation measures","DESIGN Retrospective study","combination","CONCLUSION","flowchart","period","disease"],"language":"en"},

Thus, there might be severe myocarditis, that may result in acute heart failure and cardiac complexities in the elderly subjects.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Yogendra; Gupta, Gaurav; Mishra, Anurag; Chellappan, Dinesh Kumar; Dua, Kamal","journal":"Alternative therapies in health and medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412919/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 gene","level of ACE2 activity","cardiac complexities","normal healthy younger persons","Chinese Han population","acute heart failure","essential hypertension","rs1514283","rs4646155","rs4646176","rs2285666","newfound novel corona virus","COVID","elderly subjects","cases","SNPs","relation","women","rs879922","global number of people","patients","cardiovascular diseases","confirmed data","severe myocarditis"],"language":"en"},

In 1981, the first cases of AIDS were reported and wide diagnostic testing helped to characterize high-risk groups and the global burden of the epidemic. With Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19, everything has happened too fast and both cases and fatalities are huge but still uncertain in most places. Diagnostic testing of active and past SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to expand rapidly, ideally using rapid tests. COVID-19 deaths are highly concentrated in the elderly population, with a large proportion of fatalities being \u0022with\u0022 rather than \u0022by\u0022 SARS-CoV-2 infection. They are often the result of inadequate health care due to overwhelming demands. To date, there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several antivirals are being tested clinically, including remdesivir, at this time the most promising. For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither significant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown. Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated. The benefit of orticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited. Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results. Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soriano, Vicente; Barreiro, Pablo; Ramos, Jos\u00E9 Manuel; Eir\u00F3s, Jos\u00E9 M; de Mendoza, Carmen","journal":"AIDS reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["past SARS-CoV","pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID","pandemic","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute respiratory distress","health-care systems","wide diagnostic testing","Diagnostic testing of active","result of inadequate health care","Coronavirus Disease","clinical benefit","cases of AIDS","benefit of orticosteroids","large proportion of fatalities","pneumonia","tocilizumab","different pro-inflammatory cytokines","high-risk groups","Monoclonal antibodies","characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm","societies","elderly population","antiinflammatory agents","ritonavir","global burden","best response","overwhelming demands","specific therapy","unprecedented manner","protective vaccine","anti-interleukin","lopinavir","deaths","infections","time","places","epidemic","date","hydroxychloroquine","encouraging results","rapid tests","remdesivir","antivirals"],"language":"en"},

Species react across layers but diffuse only within their own layer of distinct network topology. This multiplicity generates heterogeneous patterns with significant differences from those observed in single-layer networks. Remarkably, diffusion-induced instability can occur even if the two species have the same mobility rates; condition which can never destabilize single-layer networks. The instability condition is revealed using perturbation theory and expressed by a combination of degrees in the different layers. Our theory demonstrates that the existence of such topology-driven instabilities is generic in multiplex networks, providing a new mechanism of pattern formation.","publish_time":"2015-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kouvaris, Nikos E.; Hata, Shigefumi; Guilera, Albert D\u00EDaz-","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/398d60daab8b7c0cfda90b693136422394d3e563.json; document_parses/pdf_json/05916d82efe1f937ee48f09df4e5d7c6fede83d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4455352.xml.json","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.2923v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26042606/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep10840","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiplex networks","single-layer networks","complex networks","inhibitor species","different layers","new mechanism of pattern formation","activator-inhibitor systems","instability condition","layer of distinct network topology","new framework","significant differences","perturbation theory","topology-driven instabilities","diffusion-induced instability","separate nodes","multiplicity","heterogeneous patterns","existence","combination of degrees","classical continuous media","mobility rates","dynamical processes","advances"],"language":"en"},

Thus, immunomodulatory medicines such as steroids, including methylprednisolone, have been proposed to treat patients with severe HFMD in China, because it is postulated that inflammatory cytokines play a role in the development of severe complications. This study is to further investigate the inflammatory response in the relatively mild HFMD patients, and whether steroid treatment has a beneficial effect on the suppression of inflammation in HFMD patients. METHOD: We measured the levels of 50 kinds of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble receptors in serum samples from control patients without HFMD and the HFMD patients with or without prior treatment of intravenous methylprednisolone. RESULTS: Our present study found that even relatively mild HFMD patients without central nervous system (CNS) complications had elevated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, IL-12p40, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, which suggested systemic inflammation. In contrast, these patients also have decreased levels of other serum biomarkers, including IL-1Ra, IL-8, IL-16, soluble ICAM-1, CXCL-1, and CCL27. The dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine expression may be involved in CNS complications and unbalanced circulating leukocytes in HFMD patients. Surprisingly, patients treated with methylprednisolone had no difference in the expression levels of HFMD-associated biomarkers instead had slightly increased levels of IL-17A, which was not associated with the occurrence of HFMD. CONCLUSION: Whether steroid treatment has any beneficial effect on the prognosis of HFMD patients requires to be further investigated.","publish_time":"2013-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Mei; Zheng, Xiaoyan; Wei, Ruicheng; Zhang, Na; Zhu, Kai; Xu, Bin; Yang, Chun-Hui; Yang, Chun-Fu; Deng, Chaoyang; Pu, Dongbo; Wang, Xiaohong; Altmeyer, Ralf; Leng, Qibin","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6f350fa81730f8476614ffe7280454633d77f31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3868519.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24367714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFMD","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mild HFMD patients","prognosis of HFMD patients","severe HFMD","expression levels of HFMD","occurrence of HFMD","control patients","increased levels of IL","IL-12p40","elevated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines","Systemic upregulation of inflammatory cytokines","CNS complications","serum biomarkers","inflammatory response","steroid treatment","development of severe complications","serum samples","beneficial effect","associated biomarkers","systemic inflammation","prior treatment of intravenous methylprednisolone","soluble receptors","characteristic of critical severe hand","chemokine expression","soluble ICAM","suppression of inflammation","present study","central nervous system","foot","growth factors","mouth disease","unbalanced circulating leukocytes","tumor necrosis factor","PURPOSE","role","difference","kinds of chemokines","TNF","interleukin","pulmonary edema","CXCL","dysregulation of cytokine","BACKGROUND","steroids","China","immunomodulatory medicines","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","CCL27","METHOD","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Study design Nose and throat swabs were collected monthly for 1 year and during respiratory illnesses for 2 years in a prospective study of term and preterm infants in the Prematurity, Respiratory Outcomes, Immune System and Microbiome study. Viral pathogens were detected using Taqman Array Cards. Parents recorded symptoms during respiratory illnesses using a Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) scorecard. The COAST score was validated using linear mixed effects regression modeling to evaluate associations with hospitalization and specific infections. A data-driven method was also used to compute symptom weights and derive a new score, the Infant Research Respiratory Infection Severity Score (IRRISS). Linear mixed effects regression modeling was repeated with the IRRISS illness data. Results From April 2013 to April 2017, 50 term, 40 late preterm, and 28 extremely low gestational age (\u003C29 weeks of gestation) infants had 303 respiratory illness visits with viral testing and parent-reported symptoms. A range of illness severity was described with 39% of illness scores suggestive of severe disease. Both the COAST score and IRRISS were associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection and hospitalization. Gestational age and human rhinovirus infection were inversely associated with both scoring systems. The IRRISS and COAST scores were highly correlated (r = 0.93; P \u003C .0001).

Almost every aspect of the pathogen remains largely unknown, ranging from mechanisms involved in infection transmission, interplay with the human immune system, and covert mechanisms of end-organ damage. COVID-19 has manifested itself worldwide with a syndromic appearance that is dominated by respiratory dysregulations. While clinicians are focused on correcting respiratory homeostasis, echoing the original SARS, SARS-CoV-2 is also invading other end-organs, which may not exhibit overt clinical features. Nervous system involvement was not initially considered to play a significant role in patients with COVID-19. However, since this viewpoint was initially published, multiple studies have been released regarding the possible neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2. In our previous viewpoint, we implored our colleagues to recognize the covert tactics of SARS-CoV-2 and emphasized that symptoms like anosmia, dysgeusia, ataxia, and altered mental status could be early signs of the neurotropic potential of this virus. The past few weeks, after the viewpoint surfaced, it was noticed that it has enabled clinicians and healthcare professionals to compute the neurovirulence associated with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, as evidenced by very recently reported studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baig, Abdul Mannan","journal":"ACS Chem Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/989aa23280dbd707dded81108839db2f67efaba2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192204.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343122/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","original SARS","covert tactics of SARS","possible neurovirulence of SARS","pathogenesis of COVID","covert mechanisms of end","respiratory dysregulations","clinicians","previous viewpoint","patients","correcting respiratory homeostasis","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","end-organs","multiple studies","reported studies","human immune system","Nervous system involvement","ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease","interplay","ataxia","early signs","mental status","infection transmission","neurotropic potential","dysgeusia","symptoms","colleagues","organ damage","text","anosmia","healthcare professionals","significant role","knowledge","syndromic appearance","overt clinical features","aspect","past","weeks","Image","infancy"],"language":"en"},

This active field of research has attracted approximately 110 experts in virology and bioinformatics/computational biology from Europe and other parts of the world to attend the two-day meeting in Glasgow to increase scientific exchange between laboratory- and computer-based researchers. The meeting was held at the McIntyre Building of the University of Glasgow; a perfect location, as it was originally built to be a place for \u201Crubbing your brains with those of other people\u201D, as Rector Stanley Baldwin described it. The goal of the meeting was to provide a meaningful and interactive scientific environment to promote discussion and collaboration and to inspire and suggest new research directions and questions. The meeting featured eight invited and twelve contributed talks, on the four main topics: (1) systems virology, (2) virus-host interactions and the virome, (3) virus classification and evolution and (4) epidemiology, surveillance and evolution. Further, the meeting featured 34 oral poster presentations, all of which focused on specific areas of virus bioinformatics.

Given the high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, identifying disruptors of developmental plasticity represents an essential step for developing strategies for prevention and intervention. Applying a novel computational approach that systematically assessed connections between 436 transcriptional signatures of disease and multiple signatures of neuroplasticity, we identified inflammation as a common pathological process central to a diverse set of diseases predicted to dysregulate plasticity signatures. We tested the hypothesis that inflammation disrupts developmental cortical plasticity in vivo using the mouse ocular dominance model of experience-dependent plasticity in primary visual cortex. We found that the administration of systemic lipopolysaccharide suppressed plasticity during juvenile critical period with accompanying transcriptional changes in a particular set of molecular regulators within primary visual cortex. These findings suggest that inflammation may have unrecognized adverse consequences on the postnatal developmental trajectory and indicate that treating inflammation may reduce the burden of neurodevelopmental disorders.","publish_time":"2017-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Milo R.; Burman, Poromendro; Sadahiro, Masato; Kidd, Brian A.; Dudley, Joel T.; Morishita, Hirofumi","journal":"eNeuro","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/977f8bf86c08dd49d32dc09682e69cd99b30f4f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5241709.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28101530/; https://doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0240-16.2016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasticity signatures","inflammation","dependent plasticity","developmental cortical plasticity","disruptors of developmental plasticity","transcriptional signatures of disease","primary visual cortex","multiple signatures of neuroplasticity","postnatal developmental trajectory","burden of neurodevelopmental disorders","high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders","juvenile critical period","accompanying transcriptional changes","diverse set of diseases","periods of heightened neuroplasticity","particular set of molecular regulators","mouse ocular dominance model of experience","connections","common pathological process central","unrecognized adverse consequences","essential step","development of healthy brain function","autism","administration of systemic lipopolysaccharide","strategies","prevention","behavior","adolescence","hypothesis","novel computational approach","childhood","intervention","findings"],"language":"en"},

Although the rate of macrolide-refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) has increased, systemic glucocorticoids as a treatment option has not been validated yet. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of glucocorticoids add-on in the treatment of MRMP in children through systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Data sources A systematic literature search was conducted using ten electronic bibliographic databases including English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese languages, up to March 8, 2018. Study selection The study was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist and selected randomized control trials which compared the efficacy of glucocorticoids add-on to macrolide in the treatment of MRMP in children. Data extraction Two independent reviewers extracted: primary outcomes as hospital days, fever duration, and change in C-reactive protein (CRP) and main analysis was performed through meta-analysis with random effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-four unique randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. The mean length of hospital stay in glucocorticoids treatment group was significantly shorter than that in conventional macrolide-treatment group (Weighted mean difference (WMD) = \u2212 4.03 days). The mean length of fever duration was significantly shorter in the glucocorticoid treatment group in comparison with the conventional treatment group (WMD = -3.32 days). Level of CRP after treatment was significantly lower in the glucocorticoid treatment group than that in the conventional treatment group (WMD = -16.03). Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis showed no significant improvement in heterogeneity. As limitations of the study, most of the studies included were from a single country and we were unable to control for heterogeneity across interventions, lack of standardized measures, and different time points of assessments across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Glucocorticoid add-on treatment for MRMP can significantly shorten the duration of fever and hospital stay and decrease the level of CRP. These results should be confirmed by adequately powered studies in the future.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hwan Soo; Sol, In Suk; Li, Donghe; Choi, Miyoung; Choi, Yun Jung; Lee, Kyung Suk; Seo, Ju Hee; Lee, Yong Ju; Yang, Hyeon-Jong; Kim, Hyun Hee","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a8ffdaee3a800f0e6867b63ffd109e9c30621b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6921474.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31852460/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-019-0990-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MRMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of MRMP","glucocorticoids treatment group","conventional treatment group","glucocorticoid treatment group","treatment option","conventional macrolide-treatment group","Glucocorticoid add-on treatment","meta-analysis","main analysis","subgroup analysis","Sensitivity analysis","efficacy of glucocorticoids add-on","duration of fever","WMD","hospital days","children","mean length of fever duration","mean length of hospital","systemic glucocorticoids","Level of CRP","Study selection","Systematic Reviews","rate of macrolide","heterogeneity","powered studies","RESULTS","selected randomized control trials","Meta-Analyses checklist","systematic literature search","Weighted mean difference","refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae","unique randomized controlled trials","Data sources","Data extraction","Korean","primary outcomes","English","lack of standardized measures","different time points of assessments","Preferred Reporting Items","independent reviewers","comparison","electronic bibliographic databases","interventions","C-reactive protein","inclusion criteria","significant improvement","common pathogens","community","METHODS","random effects model","CONCLUSIONS","Japanese languages","single country","future","BACKGROUND","purpose","limitations"],"language":"en"},

Drawing on 30 years of work on the responses of health systems in the indigenous communities of Latin America, our group of researchers believes that countries in the region must be prepared to combat the epidemic in indigenous settings marked by deprivation and social disparity. We discuss four main challenges that need to be addressed by governments to guarantee the health and lives of those at the bottom of the social structure: the indigenous peoples in the region. More than an analysis, our work provides a practical guide for designing and implementing a response to COVID-19 in indigenous communities.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meneses-Navarro, Sergio; Freyermuth-Enciso, Mar\u00EDa Graciela; Pelcastre-Villafuerte, Blanca Estela; Campos-Navarro, Roberto; Mel\u00E9ndez-Navarro, David Mariano; G\u00F3mez-Flores-Ramos, Liliana","journal":"Int J Equity Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f85d931ea1560fa2ae628d23d546c7ae74bc2288.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01178-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Latin America","Guatemala","Mexico","Peru"],"keyphrases":["indigenous settings","indigenous communities of Latin America","indigenous peoples","rural indigenous communities","region","COVID","responses of health systems","Health care services","distinct challenges","social disparity","social structure","years of work","main challenges","view","ethnic groups","high levels of marginalization","Bolivia","cultural differences","deprivation","group of researchers","Guatemala","pandemic","home","marginalized population","Mexico","Peru","majority","practical guide","countries","epidemic","percent","coronavirus disease","analysis","governments"],"language":"en"},

We report here that while chronic exposure to METH disrupts barrier function of primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), an early pro-survival response is observed following acute exposure by induction of autophagic mechanisms. Acute METH exposure induces an early increase in Beclin1 and LC3 recruitment. This is mediated through inactivation of the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K pathway, and upregulation of the ERK1/2. Blockade of Kappa opioid receptor (KOR), and treatment with autophagic inhibitors accelerated METH-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the early autophagic response is a survival mechanism for endothelial cells and is mediated through the kappa opioid receptor.

It has been recently reported that in U87 glioblastoma cells IFITM proteins inhibit HIV-1 entry in a co-receptor-dependent manner, that is, IFITM1 is more inhibitory on CCR5 tropic HIV-1 whereas IFITM2/3 confers a greater suppression of CXCR4 counterparts. However, how entry of HIV-1 with distinct co-receptor usage is modulated by different IFITM orthologs in physiologically relevant CD4(\u002B) T cells and monocytes/macrophages has not been investigated in detail. Here, we report that overexpression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 in human CD4(\u002B) HuT78 cells, SupT1 cells, monocytic THP-1 cells and U87 cells expressing CD4 and co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4, suppressed entry of CXCR4 tropic viruses NL4.3 and HXB2, CCR5 tropic viruses AD8 and JRFL, dual tropic 89.6 virus, as well as a panel of 32 transmitted founder (T/F) viruses, with a consistent order of potency, that is, IFITM3 \u003E IFITM2 \u003E IFITM1. Consistent with previous reports, we found that some CCR5-using HIV-1 isolates, such as AD8 and JRFL, were relatively resistant to inhibition by IFITM2 and IFITM3, although the effect can be cell-type dependent. However, in no case have we observed that IFITM1 had a stronger inhibition on entry of any HIV-1 strains tested, including those of CCR5-using T/Fs. We knocked down the endogenous IFITMs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and purified CD4(\u002B) T cells and observed that, while this treatment did greatly enhance the multiple-round of HIV-1 replication but had modest effect to rescue the single-round HIV-1 infection, reinforcing our previous conclusion that the predominant effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 infection is in viral producer cells, rather than in target cells to block viral entry. Overall, our results argue against the idea that IFITM proteins distinguish co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 to inhibit entry but emphasize that the predominant role of IFITMs on HIV-1 is in producer cells that intrinsically impair the viral infectivity.","publish_time":"2018-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Jingyou; Liu, Shan-Lu","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73aec7f72de1b225ab650b78a7633aab4ebd97bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6115839.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087232/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10080413","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFITM","CCR5-using T/Fs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry of HIV","U87 cells","CCR5 tropic HIV","HuT78 cells","SupT1 cells","target cells","viral producer cells","viral entry","co-receptor CCR5","U87 glioblastoma cells IFITM proteins","CCR5 tropic viruses AD8","entry of enveloped viruses","single-round HIV","co-receptors CCR5","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","suppressed entry of CXCR4 tropic viruses NL4","predominant effect of IFITMs","IFITM2","relevant CD4","purified CD4","co-receptor-dependent manner","human CD4","endogenous IFITMs","overexpression of IFITM1","predominant role of IFITMs","distinct co-receptor usage","JRFL","infection","modest effect","IFITM3","viral infectivity","greater suppression of CXCR4 counterparts","different IFITM orthologs","Interferon inducible transmembrane proteins","stronger inhibition","previous conclusion","multiple-round","previous reports","cell-type dependent","consistent order of potency","HXB2","monocytic THP","PBMCs","ISGs","flaviviruses","idea","transmitted founder","panel","filoviruses","replication","isolates","IFN-stimulated genes","monocytes","macrophages","strains","retroviruses","results","Fs","treatment","case"],"language":"en"},

Such recognition initiates signaling cascades that induce intracellular innate immune defenses and an inflammatory response that facilitates development of the acquired immune response. The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) protein family are key cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptors that are implicated in the recognition of viruses across genera and virus families, including functioning as major sensors of RNA viruses, and promoting recognition of some DNA viruses. RIG-I, the charter member of the RLR family, is activated upon binding to PAMP RNA. Activated RIG-I signals by interacting with the adapter protein MAVS leading to a signaling cascade that activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03BAB. These actions induce the expression of antiviral gene products and the production of type I and III interferons that lead to an antiviral state in the infected cell and surrounding tissue. RIG-I signaling is essential for the control of infection by many RNA viruses. Recently, RIG-I crosstalk with other pathogen recognition receptors and components of the inflammasome has been described. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge regarding the role of RIG-I in recognition of a variety of virus families and its role in programming the adaptive immune response through cross-talk with parallel arms of the innate immune system, including how RIG-I can be leveraged for antiviral therapy.","publish_time":"2015-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kell, Alison M.; Gale, Michael","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87f87fc7c57a174d321ecf36ffa85ef323c04f7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4424084.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221500063X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221500063X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25749629/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["PAMP RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recognition of viruses","role of RIG","Activated RIG","recognition initiates","key cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptors","host recognition of viral products","adaptive immune response","antiviral state","DNA viruses","antiviral therapy","innate immune system","expression of antiviral gene products","major sensors of RNA viruses","protein family","intracellular innate immune defenses","RLR family","inflammatory response","Abstract Antiviral immunity","PAMP RNA","variety of virus families","non-self molecular patterns","adapter protein MAVS","retinoic acid-inducible gene","functioning","programming","cascades","parallel arms","transcription factors IRF3","infected cell","genera","production of type","NF-\u03BAB","interferons","control of infection","current knowledge","binding","charter member","development","components","crosstalk","surrounding tissue","actions","inflammasome","PAMPs","review"],"language":"en"},

We previously demonstrated that residues 377\u2013588 of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS subunit vaccine candidate, capable of inducing potent neutralization antibody responses. In this study, we sought to identify an adjuvant that optimally enhanced the immunogenicity of S377\u2013588 protein fused with Fc of human IgG (S377\u2013588-Fc). Specifically, we compared several commercially available adjuvants, including Freund\u0027s adjuvant, aluminum, Monophosphoryl lipid A, Montanide ISA51 and MF59 with regard to their capacity to enhance the immunogenicity of this subunit vaccine. In the absence of adjuvant, S377\u2013588-Fc alone induced readily detectable neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses in immunized mice. However, incorporating an adjuvant improved its immunogenicity. Particularly, among the aforementioned adjuvants evaluated, MF59 is the most potent as judged by its superior ability to induce the highest titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes, and neutralizing antibodies. The addition of MF59 significantly augmented the immunogenicity of S377\u2013588-Fc to induce strong IgG and neutralizing antibody responses as well as protection against MERS-CoV infection in mice, suggesting that MF59 is an optimal adjuvant for MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines.","publish_time":"2015-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Naru; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Ma, Cuiqing; Wang, Lili; Tang, Jian; Garron, Tania; Tao, Xinrong; Tasneem, Sumaiya; Lu, Lu; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Zhou, Yusen; Perlman, Stanley; Jiang, Shibo; Du, Lanying","journal":"Cell Mol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f50d334193fa8cd216e4c4166e43fb0c8109709.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4786625.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2015.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25640653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Freund"],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS coronavirus","MERS-CoV spike","MERS-CoV infection","immunogenicity of S377","MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines","neutralizing antibody responses","Freund\u0027s adjuvant","optimal adjuvant","absence of adjuvant","promising MERS subunit vaccine candidate","Fc of human IgG","addition of MF59","detectable neutralizing antibody","potent neutralization antibody responses","strong IgG","neutralizing antibodies","T-cell responses","highest titers of IgG","immunized mice","available adjuvants","aforementioned adjuvants","development of effective vaccines","protein receptor-binding domain","Monophosphoryl lipid","IgG1","aluminum","protection","Montanide ISA51","emerging infectious disease","IgG2a subtypes","consequence","pandemic potential","continuous spread","Middle East respiratory syndrome","high priority","superior ability","regard","worldwide attention","capacity","residues","study"],"language":"en"},

Despite the severe public health threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), there are currently no drugs available for their treatment; therefore, broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are urgently needed. To search for effective inhibitory agents, we performed high-throughput screening (HTS) of a 2,000-compound library of approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds using the established genetically engineered human CoV OC43 (HCoV-OC43) strain expressing Renilla luciferase (rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc) and validated the inhibitors using multiple genetically distinct CoVs in vitro. We screened 56 hits from the HTS data and validated 36 compounds in vitro using wild-type HCoV-OC43. Furthermore, we identified seven compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate) as broad-spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four CoVs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations. Additionally, we found that emetine blocked MERS-CoV entry according to pseudovirus entry assays and that lycorine protected BALB/c mice against HCoV-OC43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system. This represents the first demonstration of in vivo real-time bioluminescence imaging to monitor the effect of lycorine on the spread and distribution of HCoV-OC43 in a mouse model. These results offer critical information supporting the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Currently, there is no approved therapy to treat coronavirus infection; therefore, broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are needed. Based on our high-throughput screening assay using a compound library, we identified seven compounds with broad-spectrum efficacy against the replication of four CoVs in vitro. Additionally, one compound (lycorine) was found to protect BALB/c mice against HCoV-OC43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system. This inhibitor might offer promising therapeutic possibilities for combatting novel CoV infections in the future.","publish_time":"2019-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Liang; Niu, Junwei; Wang, Chunhua; Huang, Baoying; Wang, Wenling; Zhu, Na; Deng, Yao; Wang, Huijuan; Ye, Fei; Cen, Shan; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8eacedf54b52b89b270a2e148459b6d0ca6898ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6613765.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00023-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["endemic CoVs","engineered human CoV OC43","distinct CoVs","broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging","wild-type HCoV-OC43","distribution of HCoV","novel CoV infections","emetine blocked MERS-CoV entry","active compounds","broad-spectrum efficacy","effect of lycorine","Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","compound library of approved drugs","viral load","coronavirus infection","induced lethality","BALB","c mice","central nervous system","spread","high-throughput screening assay","effective therapeutic strategy","severe public health threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","approved therapy","HTS data","drugs available","pseudovirus entry assays","promising therapeutic possibilities","new host species","cross-species viruses","strong inhibition of replication","effective inhibitory agents","mycophenolic acid","mycophenolate mofetil","monensin sodium","phenazopyridine","development","Renilla luciferase","strain","pyrvinium pamoate","rOC43-ns2Del","real-time bioluminescence imaging","epidemic diseases","potential","Rluc","treatment","critical information","low-micromolar concentrations","demonstration of","results","Coronaviruses","future","mouse model","hits","IMPORTANCE"],"language":"en"},

WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates. Methods A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for \u226515 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts). High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms. We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods. Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher\u0027s exact test for the 95% CIs. Findings Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations. Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 4\u00B70 days (IQR 2\u00B73\u20134\u00B73) and the median serial interval was 4\u00B70 days (3\u00B70\u20135\u00B70). Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown. One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase. Secondary attack rates were 75\u00B70% (95% CI 19\u00B70\u201399\u00B70; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10\u00B70% (1\u00B72\u201332\u00B70; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5\u00B71% (2\u00B76\u20138\u00B79; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts. Interpretation Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred. These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.

The longan (Dimocarpus longan) somatic embryogenesis (SE) system is a good system for research on longan embryo development. RESULTS: In this study, 7643 lncRNAs obtained during early SE in D. longan were identified by high-throughput sequencing, among which 6005 lncRNAs were expressed. Of the expressed lncRNAs, 4790 were found in all samples and 160 were specifically expressed in embryogenic callus (EC), 154 in incomplete embryogenic compact structures (ICpECs), and 376 in globular embryos (GEs). We annotated the 6005 expressed lncRNAs, and 1404 lncRNAs belonged to 506 noncoding RNA (ncRNA) families and 4682 lncRNAs were predicted to target protein-coding genes.

KEGG analysis revealed that most of the differentially expressed target genes (mRNAs) of the lncRNAs were enriched in the \u201Cplant-pathogen interaction\u201D and \u201Cplant hormone signaling\u201D pathways during early longan SE. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed that 20 selected lncRNAs showed significant differences in expression and that five lncRNAs were related to auxin response factors. Compared with the FPKM expression trends, 16 lncRNA expression trends were the same in qPCR. In lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA relationship prediction, 40 lncRNAs were predicted to function as eTMs for 15 miRNAs and 7 lncRNAs were identified as potential miRNA precursors. In addition, we verified the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships by transient expression of miRNAs (miR172a, miR159a.1 and miR398a). CONCLUSION: Analyses of lncRNAs during early longan SE showed that differentially expressed lncRNAs were involved in expression regulation at each SE stage, and may form a regulatory network with miRNAs and mRNAs. These findings provide new insights into lncRNAs and lay a foundation for future functional analysis of lncRNAs during early longan SE.

Partial deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of SARS-CoV S protein (SARS-CoV-St19) allowed efficient incorporation into the VSV particle that enabled the generation of a high titer of pseudotype virus. Neutralization assay with anti-SARS-CoV antibody revealed that VSV-SARS-St19/GFP pseudotype infection is mediated by SARS-CoV S protein. The VSV\u2206G\u2217/SEAP system, which secretes alkaline phosphatase instead of GFP, was also generated as a VSV pseudotype having SARS-CoV S protein (VSV-SARS-CoV-St19/SEAP). This system enabled high-throughput analysis of SARS-CoV S protein-mediated cell entry by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity.

With socio-economic characteristics, health behavior, and underlying diseases under control, we investigated associations between media use, health information-seeking behavior, health information type, and vaccination in the population. METHODS: This study relied on a national survey of Korean adults (n = 1367). Participants were adult males and females age 20 and older. Web and face-to-face surveys were conducted throughout July 2014. The main outcome was vaccination (categorized as yes or no). Independent variables were time spent on media, frequency of health information-seeking behavior, and types of health information sought. RESULTS: Controlling for co-variates, logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that influence Korean adults being vaccinated. Results revealed that accessible information about emerging infectious diseases, listening to the radio, and reading the newspaper were associated with increased odds of being vaccinated. Active seeking health information as well as being female and of higher socio-economic status were positively correlated with Korean adults being vaccinated. CONCLUSION: It is critical to promote health information-seeking behavior and use diverse media channels to increase acceptance and awareness of emerging infectious diseases and vaccinations. Because there are differences in vaccination awareness depending on social class, it is critical to reduce communication inequality, strengthen accessibility to vaccinations, and devise appropriate risk communication strategies that ensure Korean adults receive vaccinations.","publish_time":"2017-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Jiyeon; Jung, Minsoo","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66bffe926972c130c5b6239868ae422a8c7d7229.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5594607.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28893212/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-017-4721-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health behavior","health information type","frequency of health information","types of health information","Active seeking health information","accessible information","vaccinations","awareness of emerging infectious diseases","underlying diseases","vaccination awareness","media use","national survey of Korean adults","communication inequality","RESULTS","appropriate risk communication strategies","diverse media channels","socio-economic characteristics","higher socio-economic status","acceptance","associations","scant research","females age","co-variates","control","logistic regression analysis","adult males","social class","Participants","time","accessibility","factors","newspaper","study","Independent variables","differences","radio","Web","face-to-face surveys","increased odds","main outcome","population","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The virus is classified in genotypes and lineages with different epidemiological relevance. Two lineages of the GI genotype (11 and 16) have been widely circulating for decades in South America. GI-11 is an exclusive South American lineage while the GI-16 lineage is distributed in Asia, Europe and South America. Here, we obtained the whole genome of two Uruguayan strains of the GI-11 and GI-16 lineages using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The strains here sequenced are the first obtained in South America for the infectious bronchitis virus and provide new insights into the origin, spreading and evolution of viral variants. The complete genome of the GI-11 and GI-16 strains have 27,621 and 27,638 nucleotides, respectively, and possess the same genomic organization. Phylogenetic incongruence analysis reveals that both strains have a mosaic genome that arose by recombination between Euro Asiatic strains of the GI-16 lineage and ancestral South American GI-11 viruses. The recombination occurred in South America and produced two viral variants that have retained the full-length S1 sequences of the parental lineages but are extremely similar in the rest of their genomes. These recombinant virus have been extraordinary successful, persisting in the continent for several years with a notorious wide geographic distribution.

In dromedary camels, the virus only causes a mild infection but it spreads efficiently between animals. Differences in the behavior of the virus observed between individuals, as well as between humans and dromedary camels, highlight the role of host factors in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission. One of these host factors, the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), may be a critical determinant because it is variably expressed in MERS-CoV-susceptible species as well as in humans. This could partially explain inter- and intraspecies differences in the tropism, pathogenesis, and transmissibility of MERS-CoV. In this review, we explore the role of DPP4 and other host factors in MERS-CoV transmission and pathogenesis\u2014such as sialic acids, host proteases, and interferons. Further characterization of these host determinants may potentially offer novel insights to develop intervention strategies to tackle ongoing outbreaks.","publish_time":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Widagdo, W.; Sooksawasdi Na Ayudhya, Syriam; Hundie, Gadissa B.; Haagmans, Bart L.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca5a2024931abd516addf3c4007d9a5b64432275.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6466079.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11030280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893947/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV pathogenesis","MERS-CoV transmission","transmissibility of MERS","role of host factors","MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase","host determinants","host proteases","humans","respiratory infection","role of DPP4","dromedary camels","intraspecies differences","mild infection","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","intervention strategies","novel insights","tropism","sialic acids","zoonotic pathogen","susceptible species","ongoing outbreaks","behavior","interferons","individuals","severe pneumonia","characterization","critical determinant","animals","review"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known worldwide regarding the PM1-associated health effects due to a wide lack of ground-based PM1 measurements from air monitoring stations. METHODS We collected daily records of hospital admission for respiratory diseases and station-based measurements of air pollution and weather conditions in Shenzhen, China, 2015-2016. Time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were adopted to estimate hospitalization risks associated with short-term exposures to PM1 and PM2.5. RESULTS PM1 and PM2.5 showed significant adverse effects on respiratory disease hospitalizations, while no evident associations with PM1-2.5 were identified. Admission risks for total respiratory diseases were 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.14) and 1.06 (1.02 to 1.10), corresponding to per 10 \u03BCg/m3 rise in exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 at lag 0-2 days, respectively. Both PM1 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with increased admission for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, but exhibited no effects on asthma and upper respiratory tract infection. Largely comparable risk estimates were observed between male and female patients. Groups aged 0-14 years and 45-74 years were significantly affected by PM1- and PM2.5-associated risks. PM-hospitalization associations exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with significantly larger risks in cold season than those in warm season among some subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggested that PM1 rather than PM1-2.5 contributed to PM2.5-induced risks of hospitalization for respiratory diseases and effects of PM1 and PM2.5 mainly occurred in cold season.","publish_time":"2019-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yunquan; Ding, Zan; Xiang, Qianqian; Wang, Wei; Huang, Li; Mao, Feiyue","journal":"International journal of hygiene and environmental health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31753527/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2019.11.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["effects of PM1","RESULTS PM1","based PM1 measurements","PM1-associated health effects","BACKGROUND Ambient PM1","associated risks","Admission risks","hospitalization risks","total respiratory diseases","important contribution of PM2","induced risks of hospitalization","larger risks","cold season","respiratory disease hospitalizations","significant adverse effects","upper respiratory tract infection","increased admission","PM-hospitalization associations","warm season","years","chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases","station-based measurements of air pollution","daily records of hospital admission","evident associations","air monitoring stations","conditional logistic regression models","weather conditions","particulate matter","wide lack of ground","Time-stratified case-crossover design","pneumonia","clear seasonal pattern","aerodynamic diameter","\u03BCm","Shenzhen","asthma","short-term exposures","comparable risk estimates","China","METHODS","mass","m3","lag","study","female patients","\u03BCg","subgroups","CONCLUSIONS","confidence interval","days"],"language":"en"},

Studies in humans and animal models have shown that symptoms are not immediate and appear days or even weeks after infection. Since the initial symptoms are a manifestation of virus recognition by elements of the innate immune response, early virus replication must go largely undetected. The interval between infection and the emergence of symptoms is called the incubation period and is widely used as a clinical score. While incubation periods have been described for many virus infections the underlying mechanism for this asymptomatic phase has not been comprehensively documented. Here we review studies of the interaction between human pathogenic respiratory RNA viruses and the host with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms used by viruses to inhibit immunity. We discuss the concept of the \u201Cstealth phase\u201D, defined as the time between infection and the earliest detectable inflammatory response. We propose that the \u201Cstealth phase\u201D phenomenon is primarily responsible for the suppression of symptoms during the incubation period and results from viral antagonism that inhibits major pathways of the innate immune system allowing an extended time of unhindered virus replication.","publish_time":"2010-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hermesh, Tamar; Moltedo, Bruno; L\u00F3pez, Carolina B.; Moran, Thomas M.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48764be42938595e40cb6c0bc73fc891a6e962e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3185581.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994630/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v2112541","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suppression of symptoms","emergence of symptoms","initial symptoms","virus infections","Respiratory viruses","stealth phase","early virus replication","abrupt onset of symptoms","innate immune response","extended time of unhindered virus replication","manifestation of virus recognition","humans","asymptomatic phase","Studies","incubation periods","innate immune system","human pathogenic respiratory RNA viruses","earliest detectable inflammatory response","major pathways","host","viral antagonism","interaction","results","elements","underlying mechanism","mechanisms","particular emphasis","phenomenon","disease","days","animal models","weeks","immunity","interval","concept","clinical score"],"language":"en"},

Kinetic studies indicate that in contrast to 3CL(pro) from other \u03B2-CoV 2c members, including HKU4 and HKU5, MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) is less efficient at processing a peptide substrate due to MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) being a weakly associated dimer. Conversely, HKU4, HKU5, and SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) enzymes are tightly associated dimers. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies support that MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) is a weakly associated dimer (K(d) \u223C52 \u03BCm) with a slow off-rate. Peptidomimetic inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) were synthesized and utilized in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments and demonstrate that MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) undergoes significant ligand-induced dimerization. Kinetic studies also revealed that designed reversible inhibitors act as activators at a low compound concentration as a result of induced dimerization. Primary sequence comparisons and x-ray structural analyses of two MERS-CoV 3CLpro and inhibitor complexes, determined to 1.6 \u00C5, reveal remarkable structural similarity of the dimer interface with 3CL(pro) from HKU4-CoV and HKU5-CoV. Despite this structural similarity, substantial differences in the dimerization ability suggest that long range interactions by the nonconserved amino acids distant from the dimer interface may control MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) dimerization. Activation of MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) through ligand-induced dimerization appears to be unique within the genogroup 2c and may potentially increase the complexity in the development of MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibitors as antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2015-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomar, Sakshi; Johnston, Melanie L.; St. John, Sarah E.; Osswald, Heather L.; Nyalapatla, Prasanth R.; Paul, Lake N.; Ghosh, Arun K.; Denison, Mark R.; Mesecar, Andrew D.","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a72987263c3b602888680fd3bab5f92a8725a23b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4528106.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m115.651463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26055715/; http://www.jbc.org/content/290/32/19403.full.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","HKU4-CoV","HKU5-CoV","SARS-CoV","development of MERS","\u03B2-CoV subgroup","Activation of MERS","Peptidomimetic inhibitors of MERS","dimer interface","dimerization ability","result of induced dimerization","weakly associated dimer","significant ligand-induced dimerization","Kinetic studies","Analytical ultracentrifugation studies","structural analyses","remarkable structural similarity","c members","associated dimers","reversible inhibitors act","analytical ultracentrifugation experiments","development of anti-coronavirus therapeutics","nsp5 protease","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","long range interactions","nonconserved amino acids distant","activators","low compound concentration","high value target","proteolytic activity","substantial differences","inhibitor complexes","Primary sequence comparisons","peptide substrate","CLpro","enzymes","virus replication","antiviral agents","complexity","contrast","\u03BCm","genogroup","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

The results reveal that commercial land type and the number of attractions around hotels are significantly related to the distribution of upper-grade hotels in Hong Kong. The determinants vary over time and the spatial structure changes accordingly. The analysis is important theoretically as it enriches the methodologies for analyzing the relationships between hotels and urban structure, and for conceptualizing and identifying tourism functional zones. It is important for practitioners as it provides useful information for selecting sites for hotels.","publish_time":"2015-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Mimi; Fang, Lei; Huang, Xiaoting; Goh, Carey","journal":"International Journal of Hospitality Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4fbcb9cdf555fab0171d4df0e6c17cb320d85be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127365.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287860/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431914001753; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2014.11.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278431914001753","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GIS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["grade hotels","spatial characteristics of hotels","spatial relationships","Hong Kong","attractions development","number of attractions","spatial structure changes","land use types","spatial associations of urban tourism phenomena","urban structure","study","commercial land type","transportation facilities","transport facilities","useful information","tourism functional zones","geographical information system","economic variables","tertiary planning units","conceptualizing","statistical methods","distribution of upper","time","set of logistic regression models","results","practitioners","sites","methodologies","determinants","example","analysis"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this systematic review was to identify the methodologies used in studies reporting on travelers\u0027 risk perception of infectious diseases. A systematic search for relevant literature was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. There were 39 studies identified. In 35 of 39 studies, the methodology used was that of a knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey based on questionnaires. One study used a combination of questionnaires and a visual psychometric measuring instrument called the \u2018pictorial representation of illness and self-measurement\u201D or PRISM. One study used a self-representation model (SRM) method. Two studies measured psychosocial factors. Valuable information was obtained from KAP surveys showing an overall lack of knowledge among travelers about the most frequent travel-associated infections and associated preventive measures. This methodological approach however, is mainly descriptive, addressing knowledge, attitudes, and practices separately and lacking an examination of the interrelationships between these three components. Another limitation of the KAP method is underestimating psychosocial variables that have proved influential in health related behaviors, including perceived benefits and costs of preventive measures, perceived social pressure, perceived personal control, unrealistic optimism and risk propensity. Future risk perception studies in travel medicine should consider psychosocial variables with inferential and multivariate statistical analyses. The use of implicit measurements of attitudes could also provide new insights in the field of travelers\u2019 risk perception of travel-associated infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sridhar, Shruti; R\u00E9gner, Isabelle; Brouqui, Philippe; Gautret, Philippe","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec4deb95095d0a80cf7f0568e77c6f7ea545a32b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110652.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S147789391630045X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2016.05.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27238906/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147789391630045X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Future risk perception studies","travelers\u0027 risk perception of infectious diseases","field of travelers\u2019 risk perception of travel","Summary Numerous studies","risk propensity","psychosocial variables","KAP method","costs of preventive measures","implementation of preventive measures","travel medicine","Systematic Reviews","KAP surveys","systematic search","frequent travel-associated infections","psychosocial factors","perceived benefits","study","self-representation model","overall lack of knowledge","self-measurement","combination of questionnaires","pictorial representation of illness","Meta-Analyses guidelines","multivariate statistical analyses","importance of travelers\u0027 psychology","Preferred Reporting Items","use of implicit measurements of attitudes","personal control","social pressure","visual psychometric measuring instrument","health related behaviors","unrealistic optimism","new insights","past","relevant literature","SRM","methodologies","PRISM","Valuable information","practices","interrelationships","examination","methodological approach","aim","limitation","methodology","components"],"language":"en"},

The Hendra virus nucleocapsid protein (HeV N) represents the most abundant viral protein produced by the host cell, and is highly immunogenic with naturally infected humans and horses producing specific antibodies towards this protein. The purpose of this study was to express and purify soluble, functionally active recombinant HeV N, suitable for use as an immunodiagnostic reagent to detect antibodies against HeV. We expressed both full-length HeV N, (HeV NFL), and a C-terminal truncated form, (HeV NCORE), using a bacterial heterologous expression system.

Due to the chronic course of the disease combining with devastating complications, this disorder could easily carry a financial burden. The early diagnosis of diabetes remains as one of the major challenges medical providers are facing, and the satisfactory screening tools or methods are still required, especially a population- or community-based tool. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 15,323 subjects who underwent the annual check-up in the Department of Family Medicine of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2017 to June 2017. With a strict data filtration, 10,436 records from the eligible participants were utilized to develop a prediction model using the J48 decision tree algorithm. Nine variables, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, family history of diabetes, physical activity, work-related stress, and salty food preference, were considered. RESULTS: The accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value for identifying potential diabetes were 94.2%, 94.0%, 94.2%, and 94.8%, respectively. The structure of the decision tree shows that age is the most significant feature. The decision tree demonstrated that among those participants with age \u2264 49, 5497 participants (97%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic, while age \u003E 49, 771 participants (50%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic. In the subgroup where people were 34 \u003C age \u2264 49 and BMI \u2265 25, when with positive family history of diabetes, 89 (92%) out of 97 individuals were identified as diabetic and, when without family history of diabetes, 576 (58%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic. Work-related stress was identified as being associated with diabetes. In individuals with 34 \u003C age \u2264 49 and BMI \u2265 25 and without family history of diabetes, 22 (51%) of the individuals with high work-related stress were identified as nondiabetic while 349 (88%) of the individuals with low or moderate work-related stress were identified as not having diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a classifier based on a decision tree which used nine features of patients which are easily obtained and noninvasive as predictor variables to identify potential incidents of diabetes. The classifier indicates that a decision tree analysis can be successfully applied to screen diabetes, which will support clinical practitioners for rapid diabetes identification. The model provides a means to target the prevention of diabetes which could reduce the burden on the health system through effective case management.","publish_time":"2019-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pei, Dongmei; Zhang, Chengpu; Quan, Yu; Guo, Qiyong","journal":"J Diabetes Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0dc958db13e5ac3b76b8204a8081ad0cec38bcfa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6362481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6362481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential diabetes","Diabetes mellitus","screen diabetes","prevention of diabetes","individuals","positive family history of diabetes","potential incidents of diabetes","rapid diabetes identification","early diagnosis of diabetes","nondiabetic","decision tree analysis","history of cardiovascular disease","moderate work-related stress","high work-related stress","BMI","J48 decision tree algorithm","chronic disease","eligible participants","classifier","methods","Department of Family Medicine of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University","predictor variables","chronic course","prediction model","financial burden","community-based tool","major challenges medical providers","physical activity","AUC","gender","hypertension","stroke","body mass index","clinical practitioners","subjects","area","receiver","characteristic curve","health system","records","value","annual check-up","effective case management","salty food preference","precision","recall","disorder","steadfast increase","retrospective cross-sectional study","devastating complications","strict data filtration","satisfactory screening tools","accuracy","population","prevalence","features of patients","means","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","significant feature","subgroup","people","structure","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

These parameters form the basis for predicting a future outbreak, planning preventive measures and monitoring the progress of the disease outbreak. We study inference problems during the emerging phase of an outbreak, and point out potential sources of bias, with emphasis on: contact tracing backwards in time, replacing generation times by serial intervals, multiple potential infectors and censoring effects amplified by exponential growth. These biases directly affect the estimation of, for example, the generation time distribution and the case fatality rate, but can then propagate to other estimates such as R(0) and growth rate.

Nevertheless, the cochlea of the mammalian inner ear, a tiny organ mediating hearing, has yet to be examined. Here, we focused on the stria vascularis, an epithelial-like tissue in the cochlea, and characterised N-glycans by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. This hypervascular tissue not only expresses several ion transporters and channels to control the electrochemical balance in the cochlea but also harbours different transporters and receptors that maintain structure and activity of the organ. Seventy-nine N-linked glycans were identified in the rat stria vascularis. Among these, in 55 glycans, the complete structures were determined; in the other 24 species, partial glycosidic linkage patterns and full profiles of the monosaccharide composition were identified. In the process of characterisation, several sialylated glycans were subjected sequentially to two different alkylamidation reactions; this derivatisation helped to distinguish \u03B12,3-linkage and \u03B12,6-linkage sialyl isomers with mass spectrometry.

The potential inverse relation of HDL to coronary artery disease (CAD) and the effects of HDL on myriad other inflammatory conditions warrant a better understanding of the genetic basis of the HDL proteome. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of the regulation of the proteome of HDL isolated from a panel of 100 diverse inbred strains of mice (the hybrid mouse diversity panel) and examined protein composition and efflux capacity to identify novel factors that affect the HDL proteome. Genetic analysis revealed widely varied HDL protein levels across the strains. Some of this variation was explained by local cis-acting regulation, termed cis-protein quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Variations in apoA-II and apoC-3 affected the abundance of multiple HDL proteins, indicating a coordinated regulation. We identified modules of covarying proteins and defined a protein-protein interaction network that describes the protein composition of the naturally occurring subspecies of HDL in mice. Sterol efflux capacity varied up to 3-fold across the strains, and HDL proteins displayed distinct correlation patterns with macrophage and ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux capacity and cholesterol exchange, suggesting that subspecies of HDL participate in discrete functions. The baseline and stimulated sterol efflux capacity phenotypes were associated with distinct QTLs with smaller effect size, suggesting a multigenetic regulation. Our results highlight the complexity of HDL particles by revealing the high degree of heterogeneity and intercorrelation, some of which is associated with functional variation, and support the concept that HDL-cholesterol alone is not an accurate measure of HDL\u2019s properties, such as protection against CAD.","publish_time":"2019-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pamir, Nathalie; Pan, Calvin; Plubell, Deanna L.; Hutchins, Patrick M.; Tang, Chongren; Wimberger, Jake; Irwin, Angela; Vallim, Thomas Q. de Aguiar; Heinecke, Jay W.; Lusis, Aldons J.","journal":"J Lipid Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5d7b78cf1acf78071a1b54e6f4fe6dd68ac9430.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6399512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6399512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HDL-cholesterol","HDL proteome","proteome of HDL","subspecies of HDL","effects of HDL","varied HDL protein levels","complexity of HDL particles","abundance of multiple HDL proteins","protein composition","potential inverse relation of HDL","protein-protein interaction network","associated proteins","ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux capacity","cholesterol exchange","multigenetic regulation","coordinated regulation","stimulated sterol efflux capacity phenotypes","cis-protein quantitative trait loci","distinct QTLs","local cis-acting regulation","genetic basis","CAD","modules of covarying proteins","comprehensive genetic analysis","diverse inbred strains of mice","functional variation","distinct correlation patterns","hybrid mouse diversity panel","macrophage","coronary artery disease","smaller effect size","better understanding","inflammatory conditions","novel factors","baseline","phospholipids","high degree of heterogeneity","accurate measure of HDL\u2019s properties","concept","apoC","intercorrelation","protection","cholesteryl esters","results","nanoparticles","discrete functions","fold","Variations","apoA","HDLs"],"language":"en"},

Timely serotyping can provide early warning of dengue epidemics to improve management of patients and outbreaks.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: In this study, side-by-side comparison with the CDC DENV-1-4 Real Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the performance of four singleplex DENV-1\u20134 serotyping reverse transcription-iiPCR (RT-iiPCR) reagents for DENV subtyping on the mobile PCR system. The four RT-iiPCRs did not react with Zika virus and chikungunya virus; tests with serial dilutions of the four DENV serotypes made in human serum showed they had detection endpoints comparable to those of the reference method, indicating great analytical sensitivity and specificity. Clinical performance of the RT-iiPCR reagents was evaluated by testing 40 serum samples each (around 20 target serotype-positive and 20 DENV-negative); all four reagents had high agreement (97.5\u2013100%) with the reference qRT-PCR. Moreover, testing of mosquitoes separately infected experimentally with each serotype showed that the four reagents detected specifically their target DENV serotypes in mosquito.

We previously reported that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was involved in PRRSV-induced immunosuppression during an early phase of infection. However, the exact mechanism associated with PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra immunomodulation remains unknown. To explore the immunomodulatory properties of PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra on porcine immune functions, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) and leukocytes were cultured with type 2 PRRSV, and the immunological role of IL-1Ra was assessed by addition of anti-porcine IL-1Ra Ab. The results demonstrated that PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra reduced phagocytosis, surface expression of MHC II (SLA-DR) and CD86, as well as downregulation of IFNA and IL1 gene expression in the MoDC culture system. Interestingly, IL-1Ra secreted by the PRRSV-infected MoDC also inhibited T lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation, but not IFN-\u03B3 production. Although PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra was not directly linked to IL-10 production, it contributed to the differentiation of regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) within the culture system. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra downregulates innate immune functions, T lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation, and influences collectively with IL-10 in the Treg induction. The immunomodulatory roles of IL-1Ra elucidated in this study increase our understanding of the immunobiology of PRRSV.","publish_time":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nedumpun, Teerawut; Techakriengkrai, Navapon; Thanawongnuwech, Roongroje; Suradhat, Sanipa","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55322bfc591eeae6d68a9826baaebf6ec74234ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6443931.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6443931/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IL","MHC II","IFNA","PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV-induced IL","PRRSV-induced immunosuppression","Ra immunomodulation","immunobiology of PRRSV","immunomodulatory roles of IL","PRRSV-infected MoDC","immunological role of IL","immunomodulatory properties of PRRSV","course of PRRSV infection","Ra reduced phagocytosis","addition of anti-porcine IL","T lymphocyte differentiation","innate immune functions","porcine immune functions","MoDC culture system","differentiation of regulatory T lymphocytes","proliferation","results","adaptive immune responses","Treg induction","IL1 gene expression","surface expression of MHC","early phase of infection","IFN-\u03B3 production","monocyte-derived dendritic cells","leukocytes","downregulation of IFNA","SLA-DR","receptor antagonist","influences","exact mechanism","CD86","understanding","study","type","interleukin"],"language":"en"},

While vaccination is the preferred intervention strategy against influenza, its efficacy is reduced in the elderly and infants who are most susceptible to severe and/or fatal infections. In addition, antigenic variation of IAV complicates the production of efficacious vaccines. Similarly, effectiveness of currently used antiviral drugs is jeopardized by the development of resistance to these drugs. Like many viruses, IAV is reliant on host factors and signaling-pathways for its replication, which could potentially offer alternative options to treat infections. While host-factors have long been recognized as attractive therapeutic candidates against other viruses, only recently they have been targeted for development as IAV antivirals. Future strategies to combat IAV infections will most likely include approaches that alter host-virus interactions on the one hand or dampen harmful host immune responses on the other, with the use of biological response modifiers (BRMs). In principle, BRMs are biologically active agents including antibodies, small peptides, and/or other (small) molecules that can influence the immune response. BRMs are already being used in the clinic to treat malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Repurposing such agents would allow for accelerated use against severe and potentially fatal IAV infections. In this review, we will address the potential therapeutic use of different BRM classes to modulate the immune response induced after IAV infections.","publish_time":"2019-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elbahesh, Husni; Gerlach, Thomas; Saletti, Giulietta; Rimmelzwaan, Guus F.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6473099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6473099/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fatal IAV infections","IAV antivirals","fatal infections","antigenic variation of IAV","host factors","host-factors","BRMs","host-virus interactions","harmful host immune responses","accelerated use","influenza","use of biological response modifiers","viruses","potential therapeutic use of different BRM classes","active agents","arsenal of options","small peptides","alternative options","antiviral drugs","development of resistance","attractive therapeutic candidates","hand","significant morbidity","antibodies","long","preferred intervention strategy","approaches","yearly epidemics","efficacy","mortality","production of efficacious vaccines","clinic","malignancies","autoimmune diseases","vaccination","infants","addition","principle","pathways","molecules","Future strategies","replication","pandemics","effectiveness","review"],"language":"en"},

Once activated by dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates the translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03B1 (eIF2\u03B1), halting cellular translation. Many viruses have methods of inhibiting PKR activation or its downstream effects, circumventing protein synthesis shutdown. These include sequestering dsRNA or producing proteins that bind to and inhibit PKR activation. Here we describe our finding that in multiple cell types, PKR was depleted during mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1) infection. MAV-1 did not appear to be targeting PKR at the transcriptional or translational level, because total PKR mRNA levels and levels of PKR mRNA bound to polysomes were unchanged or increased during MAV-1 infection. However, inhibiting the proteasome reduced the PKR depletion seen in MAV-1-infected cells, whereas inhibiting the lysosome had no effect. This suggests that proteasomal degradation alone is responsible for PKR degradation during MAV-1 infection. Time course experiments indicated that the degradation occurs early after infection. Infecting cells with UV-inactivated virus prevented PKR degradation, whereas inhibiting viral DNA replication did not. Together, these results suggest that an early viral gene is responsible. Degradation of PKR is a rare mechanism to oppose PKR activity, and it has been described in only six RNA viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a DNA virus counteracting PKR by degrading it.","publish_time":"2019-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodman, Danielle E.; Pretto, Carla D.; Krepostman, Tomas A.; Carnahan, Kelly E.; Spindler, Katherine R.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40cf1b3081095810f3ea2fe14764071d3c1c1c65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6479006.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6479006/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PKR degradation","Degradation of PKR","PKR activity","PKR depletion","levels of PKR mRNA","methods of inhibiting PKR activation","MAV","infection","total PKR mRNA levels","proteasomal degradation","RNA viruses","DNA virus","sequestering dsRNA","viral DNA replication","early viral gene","translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor","cellular translation","Infecting cells","infected cells","UV-inactivated virus","protein synthesis shutdown","Protein kinase R","sensing double-stranded RNA","downstream effects","activating host immunity","translational level","eIF2\u03B1","major role","polysomes","rare mechanism","multiple cell types","mouse adenovirus type","example","finding","lysosome","results","Time course experiments","proteins","proteasome","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Our approach thus identifies both a host antiviral factor and a viral mechanism of innate immune evasion.","publish_time":"2019-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soday, Lior; Lu, Yongxu; Albarnaz, Jonas D.; Davies, Colin T.R.; Antrobus, Robin; Smith, Geoffrey L.; Weekes, Michael P.","journal":"Cell Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5efda07d4d247024ea5afb007bd2a5f05501ce8f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9ff6863b239e533b93dd1147c0c9a36a01d7ad66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6518873.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VACV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VACV infection","viral proteins","cellular proteins","viral targets","interferon regulatory factor","nuclear factor \u03BAB","temporal classification of VACV gene expression","viral mechanism of innate immune evasion","host antiviral factor","multifunctional IFN antagonist","IFN-stimulated genes","proteasomal degradation of HDAC5","numerous immune evasion strategies","protein C6","NF-\u03BAB","herpes simplex virus type","Vaccinia virus","multiple mechanisms of inhibition","putative natural killer cell ligands","fold","IRF","time points","histone deacetylase","replication","total","multiplexed proteomics","approach","follow-up analysis","thirds"],"language":"en"},

Recently, studies have demonstrated the presence of EBOV proteins VP40, glycoprotein (GP), and nucleoprotein (NP) packaged into extracellular vesicles (EVs) during infection. EVs containing EBOV proteins have been shown to induce apoptosis in recipient immune cells, as well as contain pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Producing rhinovirus (RV) inocula from nasal secretions has required prolonged observation of the virus donor to exclude extraneous pathogens. We produced a RV-A16 inoculum using reverse genetics and determined the dose necessary to cause moderate colds in seronegative volunteers. METHODS: The consensus sequence of RV-A16 from a previous inoculum was cloned, and inoculum virus was produced using reverse genetics techniques. After safety testing, volunteers were inoculated with either RV-A16 (n = 26) or placebo (n = 10), Jackson cold scores were recorded, and nasal secretions were tested for shedding of RV-A16 ribonucleic acid. RESULTS: The reverse genetics process produced infectious virus that was neutralized by specific antisera and had a mutation rate similar to conventional virus growth techniques. The 1000 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) dose produced moderate colds in most individuals with effects similar to that of a previously tested conventional RV-A16 inoculum. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse genetics techniques produced a RV-A16 inoculum that can cause clinical colds in seronegative volunteers, and they also serve as a stable source of virus for laboratory use. The recombinant production procedures eliminate the need to derive seed virus from nasal secretions, thus precluding introduction of extraneous pathogens through this route.","publish_time":"2019-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gern, James E; Lee, Wai Ming; Swenson, Cheri A; Nakagome, Kazuyuki; Lee, Iris; Wolff, Michele; Grindle, Kristine; Sigelman, Steven; Liggett, Stephen B; Togias, Alkis; Evans, Michael; Denlinger, Loren; Gangnon, Ronald; Bochkov, Yury A; Crisafi, Gina","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6b2ffc5a86ad4dd61bdc1ff6aaea7bacf824679.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6581892.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6581892/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jackson"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inoculum virus","tested conventional RV-A16 inoculum","infectious virus","shedding of RV","reverse genetics techniques","virus donor","seed virus","conventional virus growth techniques","nasal secretions","reverse genetics process","previous inoculum","consensus sequence of RV","stable source of virus","A16 ribonucleic acid","moderate colds","seronegative volunteers","dose necessary","clinical colds","introduction of extraneous pathogens","median tissue culture infectious dose","effects similar","mutation rate similar","Jackson cold scores","important tool","need","TCID","prolonged observation","specific antisera","individuals","Experimental inoculation","asthma research","laboratory use","recombinant production procedures","BACKGROUND","route","METHODS","RESULTS","rhinovirus","CONCLUSIONS","safety testing","placebo"],"language":"en"},

It is usually a self-limiting disease; however, the common cold can cause significant morbidity and has a substantial economic impact on society. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), which cause up to two-thirds of colds, have temperature-dependent replication and most HRV strains replicate optimally at 33\u00B0C. Delivery of heated, humidified air to the upper airways has the potential to reduce viral replication, but evidence of the effectiveness of this treatment of the common cold is inconclusive. We plan to test the hypothesis that delivery of humidified air heated to 41\u00B0C at high flow, nasal high flow rhinothermy (rNHF), for 2 hours daily for five days is more effective in reducing common cold symptom severity and duration than five days of \u2018sham\u2019 rhinothermy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised, single-blind, parallel-group trial comparing rNHF to \u2018sham\u2019 rhinothermy in the treatment of common cold. We plan to recruit 170 participants within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms of common cold and randomise them 1:1 to receive one of the two treatments for five days.

Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a panel of HIV-1 strains with broad and potent resistance against a large number of bnAbs, particularly those targeting the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that several key epitope mutations facilitate resistance and are located in the inner domain, loop D, and \u03B223/loop V5/\u03B224 of HIV-1 gp120. The resistance is largely correlated with binding affinity of antibodies to the envelope trimers expressed on the cell surface.

Serum exosomes are nanovesicles that have multiple biological functions, playing roles in antigen presentation, intercellular signal communication, inflammatory response and immune surveillance. However, the biological functions and related molecular bases remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the profiles of cytokines/chemokines harbored in the exosomes of septic mice and explored the mechanisms of immunomodulation on T cells treated with exosomes harvested from septic mice. Blood cytokines/chemokines existed in both the soluble form and in the insoluble exosomal form; the profiles of the cytokines/chemokines in these two forms displayed different dynamics in the blood of mice challenged with LPS. Exosomes from septic mice induced the differentiation of Th1/Th2 cells, which was blocked by specific antibodies targeting IL-12 and IL-4. In addition, these exosomes significantly augmented the proliferation and migration of T lymphocytes. Furthermore, preadministration of exosomes by intravenous injection restrained the inflammatory response, attenuated lung and liver tissue damage, and prolonged the survival of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice. Our results indicate that exosomes enriched with cytokines/chemokines play critical roles in T cell differentiation, proliferation and chemotaxis during the sepsis process and have a protective effect on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice. Thus, these findings not only strengthen our understanding of the role of sepsis via exosomes but also provide potential targets for therapeutic applications.","publish_time":"2019-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Kun; Jin, Jingmiao; Huang, Chenyang; Li, Jianhang; Luo, Haihua; Li, Lei; Huang, Yukai; Jiang, Yong","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6c06b168e38dd8418fbc697bb3cd5abbc7cdaa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6640201.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6640201/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exosomes of septic mice","blood of mice","preadministration of exosomes","Serum exosomes","chemokines","Blood cytokines","profiles of cytokines","inflammatory response","immune response","T cells","sepsis process","progression of sepsis","role of sepsis","blood play crucial roles","critical roles","T cell differentiation","proliferation","puncture","CLP","multiple biological functions","survival of cecal ligation","migration of T lymphocytes","differentiation of Th1","soluble form","immune surveillance","Th2 cells","insoluble exosomal form","intercellular signal communication","antigen presentation","attenuated lung","chemokine levels","protective effect","chemotaxis","liver tissue damage","intravenous injection","nanovesicles","forms","mechanisms of immunomodulation","elevated cytokine","potential targets","different dynamics","related molecular bases","infection","life-threatening condition","therapeutic applications","understanding","specific antibodies","LPS","results","findings","study","addition"],"language":"en"},

Biomolecules in complex matrices could be separated by MCE and sequentially detected by MS. The effective radius and the aspect ratio of each separated biomolecule were simultaneously determined through the separation by MCE, which were then used as restraints in determining biomolecule conformations through modeling. Feasibility of this method was verified by analyzing a mixture of somatostatin and bradykinin, two peptides with known liquid-phase structures. Proteins could also be structurally analyzed using this method, which was demonstrated for lysozyme. The combination of MCE and MS for complex sample analysis was also demonstrated.

However, they are limited by the quality of initial word embeddings. Word embedding trained by electronic health records (EHRs) is considered the best, but the vocabulary diversity is limited by previous medical records. Thus, we require a word embedding model that maintains the vocabulary diversity of open internet databases and the medical terminology understanding of EHRs. Moreover, we need to consider the particularity of the disease classification, wherein discharge notes present only positive disease descriptions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to propose a projection word2vec model and a hybrid sampling method. In addition, we aimed to conduct a series of experiments to validate the effectiveness of these methods. METHODS: We compared the projection word2vec model and traditional word2vec model using two corpora sources: English Wikipedia and PubMed journal abstracts. We used seven published datasets to measure the medical semantic understanding of the word2vec models and used these embeddings to identify the three\u2013character-level ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes in a set of discharge notes. On the basis of embedding technology improvement, we also tried to apply the hybrid sampling method to improve accuracy. The 94,483 labeled discharge notes from the Tri-Service General Hospital of Taipei, Taiwan, from June 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017, were used. To evaluate the model performance, 24,762 discharge notes from July 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, from the same hospital were used. Moreover, 74,324 additional discharge notes collected from seven other hospitals were tested. The F-measure, which is the major global measure of effectiveness, was adopted. RESULTS: In medical semantic understanding, the original EHR embeddings and PubMed embeddings exhibited superior performance to the original Wikipedia embeddings. After projection training technology was applied, the projection Wikipedia embeddings exhibited an obvious improvement but did not reach the level of original EHR embeddings or PubMed embeddings. In the subsequent ICD-10-CM coding experiment, the model that used both projection PubMed and Wikipedia embeddings had the highest testing mean F-measure (0.7362 and 0.6693 in Tri-Service General Hospital and the seven other hospitals, respectively). Moreover, the hybrid sampling method was found to improve the model performance (F-measure=0.7371/0.6698). CONCLUSIONS: The word embeddings trained using EHR and PubMed could understand medical semantics better, and the proposed projection word2vec model improved the ability of medical semantics extraction in Wikipedia embeddings. Although the improvement from the projection word2vec model in the real ICD-10-CM coding task was not substantial, the models could effectively handle emerging diseases. The proposed hybrid sampling method enables the model to behave like a human expert.","publish_time":"2019-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Chin; Lou, Yu-Sheng; Tsai, Dung-Jang; Lee, Chia-Cheng; Hsu, Chia-Jung; Wu, Ding-Chung; Wang, Mei-Chuen; Fang, Wen-Hui","journal":"JMIR Med Inform","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6683650.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6683650/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["English Wikipedia"],"locations":["Wikipedia"],"keyphrases":["PubMed embeddings","projection Wikipedia embeddings","model performance","original Wikipedia embeddings","proposed projection word2vec model","projection PubMed","traditional word2vec model","level of original EHR embeddings","word2vec models","quality of initial word embeddings","medical semantic understanding","F-measure","projection training technology","set of discharge notes","labeled discharge notes","additional discharge notes","medical terminology","proposed hybrid sampling method","English Wikipedia","previous medical records","technology improvement","ability of medical semantics extraction","real ICD","subsequent ICD","PubMed journal abstracts","character-level ICD","major global measure of effectiveness","superior performance","Tri-Service General Hospital of Taipei","disease classification","obvious improvement","EHRs","hospitals","methods","current state-of-the-art models","useful semantic properties","International Classification of Diseases","diagnostic codes","coding task","coding experiment","emerging diseases","vocabulary diversity of open internet databases","electronic health records","positive disease descriptions","corpora sources","highest testing","Revision Clinical Modification","Taiwan","published datasets","BACKGROUND","best","RESULTS","accuracy","series of experiments","particularity","human expert","basis","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Two schools, one each from a rural and urban area, will be purposively selected. From each school, 350 students will be randomly selected proportional to class size and gender to participate. Nine index students from each school will be randomly selected and followed-up to their households. All index household residents will be recruited into the study. A further 3-5 neighbouring households will also be recruited to give a maximum of 350 participants per household setting.

In China, eight IIDs are listed as notifiable infectious diseases, including cholera, poliomyelitis, dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid (TAP), viral Hepatitis A, viral Hepatitis E, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and other infectious diarrhoeal diseases (OIDDs). The aim of the study is to analyse the spatio-temporal distribution of IIDs from 2006 to 2016. METHODS: Data on the incidence of IIDs from 2006 to 2016 were collected from the public health science data centre issued by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This study applied seasonal decomposition analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis and space-time scan analysis. Plots and maps were constructed to visualize the spatio-temporal distribution of IIDs. RESULTS: Regarding temporal analysis, the incidence of HFMD and Hepatitis E showed a distinct increasing trend, while the incidence of TAP, dysentery, and Hepatitis A presented decreasing trends over the last decade. The incidence of OIID remained steady. Summer is the season with the greatest number of cases of different IIDs. Regarding the spatial distribution, approximately all p values for the global Moran\u2019s I from 2006 to 2016 were less than 0.05, indicating that the incidences of the epidemics were unevenly distributed throughout the country. The high-risk areas for HFMD and OIDD were located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan (BTT) region and south China. The high-risk areas for TAP were located in some parts of southwest China. A higher incidence rates for dysentery and Hepatitis A were observed in the BTT region and some west provincial units. The high-risk areas for Hepatitis E were the BTT region and the Yangtze River Delta area. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our temporal and spatial analysis of IIDs, we identified the high-risk periods and clusters of regions for the diseases. HFMD and OIDD exhibited high incidence rates, which reflected the negligence of Class C diseases by the government. At the same time, the incidence rate of Hepatitis E gradually surpassed Hepatitis A. The authorities should pay more attention to Class C diseases and Hepatitis E. Regardless of the various distribution patterns of IIDs, disease-specific, location-specific, and disease-combined interventions should be established.

It does so by acting as a sensor that intercepts antibody-coated viruses that have evaded extracellular neutralization and breached the cell membrane. Upon engagement of the Fc of antibodies bound to viruses, TRIM21 triggers a coordinated effector and signaling response that prevents viral replication while at the same time inducing an anti-viral cellular state. This dual effector function is tightly regulated by auto-ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Therapeutically, TRIM21 has been shown to be detrimental in adenovirus based gene therapy, while it may be favorably utilized to prevent tau aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, TRIM21 may synergize with the complement system to block viral replication as well as transgene expression. TRIM21 can also be utilized as a research tool to deplete specific proteins in cells and zebrafish embryos.

However, this powerful technology is difficult to apply in diagnostic laboratories because of its computational and bioinformatic demands. We have developed DisCVR, which detects known human viruses in clinical samples by matching sample k-mers (twenty-two nucleotide sequences) to k-mers from taxonomically labeled viral genomes. DisCVR was validated using published HTS data for eighty-nine clinical samples from adults with upper respiratory tract infections. These samples had been tested for viruses metagenomically and also by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, which is the standard diagnostic method. DisCVR detected human viruses with high sensitivity (79%) and specificity (100%), and was able to detect mixed infections. Moreover, it produced results comparable to those in a published metagenomic analysis of 177 blood samples from patients in Nigeria. DisCVR has been designed as a user-friendly tool for detecting human viruses from HTS data using computers with limited RAM and processing power, and includes a graphical user interface to help users interpret and validate the output.

As orally transmitted viruses, densoviruses, are also challenged by the complexity of the insect gut barriers, more specifically by the chitinous peritrophic matrix, that lines and protects the midgut epithelium; how capsids stick to and cross these barriers to reach their final cell destination where replication goes has been poorly studied in insects. Here, we analyzed the early interaction of the Junonia coenia densovirus (JcDV) with the midgut barriers of caterpillars from the pest Spodoptera frugiperda. Using combination of imaging, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, we examined in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo the early interaction of the capsids with the peritrophic matrix and the consequence of early oral infection on the overall gut function. We show that the JcDV particle rapidly adheres to the peritrophic matrix through interaction with different glycans including chitin and glycoproteins, and that these interactions are necessary for oral infection. Proteomic analyses of JcDV binding proteins of the peritrophic matrix revealed mucins and non-mucins proteins including enzymes already known to act as receptors for several insect pathogens. In addition, we show that JcDV early infection results in an arrest of N-Acetylglucosamine secretion and a disruption in the integrity of the peritrophic matrix, which may help viral particles to pass through. Finally, JcDV early infection induces changes in midgut genes expression favoring an increased metabolism including an increased translational activity. These dysregulations probably participate to the overall dysfunction of the gut barrier in the early steps of viral pathogenesis. A better understanding of early steps of densovirus infection process is crucial to build biocontrol strategies against major insect pests.","publish_time":"2019-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pigeyre, Laetitia; Schatz, Malvina; Ravallec, Marc; Gasmi, Leila; N\u00E8gre, Nicolas; Clouet, C\u00E9cile; Seveno, Martial; El Koulali, Khadija; Decourcelle, Mathilde; Guerardel, Yann; Cot, Didier; Dupressoir, Thierry; Gosselin-Grenet, Anne-Sophie; Ogliastro, Myl\u00E8ne","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e0828fc0cba2f4c01abe363c059bb7c0036176d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6783882.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6783882/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early interaction","JcDV early infection results","consequence of early oral infection","chitinous peritrophic matrix","success of oral infection","insect gut barriers","early steps of viral pathogenesis","JcDV particle","better understanding of early steps of densovirus infection process","Proteomic analyses of JcDV binding proteins","midgut barriers of caterpillars","gut epithelial barrier","overall gut function","midgut epithelium","capsids","insect pathogens","non-mucins proteins","midgut genes expression","major insect pests","increased metabolism","overall dysfunction","transcriptomic analyses","viral particles","transmitted viruses","Junonia coenia densovirus","increased translational activity","biocontrol strategies","arrest of N","different glycans","changes","disruption","host","enzymes","lines","capacity","Acetylglucosamine secretion","glycoproteins","final cell destination","pest Spodoptera frugiperda","interactions","integrity","combination of imaging","mucous extracellular matrices","replication","receptors","complexity","densoviruses","dysregulations","addition","insects"],"language":"en"},

Traditional population-based methods may fail to capture important events, particularly in settings with limited access to health care, such as urban informal settlements. In such environments, a mixture of surface water runoff and human feces containing pathogenic microorganisms could be used as a surveillance surrogate. METHOD: We conducted a temporal metagenomic analysis of urban sewage from Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, to detect and quantify bacterial and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, viral and parasitic pathogens. Data were examined in conjunction with data from ongoing clinical infectious disease surveillance. RESULTS: A large variation of read abundances related to bacteria, viruses, and parasites of medical importance, as well as bacterial associated antimicrobial resistance genes over time were detected. Significant increased abundances were observed for a number of bacterial pathogens coinciding with higher abundances of AMR genes. Vibrio cholerae as well as rotavirus A, among other virus peaked in several weeks during the study period whereas Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp, varied more over time. CONCLUSION: The metagenomic surveillance approach for monitoring circulating pathogens in sewage was able to detect putative pathogen and resistance loads in an urban informal settlement. Thus, valuable if generated in real time to serve as a comprehensive infectious disease agent surveillance system with the potential to guide disease prevention and treatment. The approach may lead to a paradigm shift in conducting real-time global genomics-based surveillance in settings with limited access to health care.","publish_time":"2019-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hendriksen, Rene S.; Lukjancenko, Oksana; Munk, Patrick; Hjelms\u00F8, Mathis H.; Verani, Jennifer R.; Ng\u2019eno, Eric; Bigogo, Godfrey; Kiplangat, Samuel; Oumar, Traor\u00E9; Bergmark, Lasse; R\u00F6der, Timo; Neatherlin, John C.; Clayton, Onyango; Hald, Tine; Karlsmose, Susanne; Pamp, S\u00FCnje J.; Fields, Barry; Montgomery, Joel M.; Aarestrup, Frank M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8538c23b7be59b19a8376c51d6ec269c00b34bec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6786639.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6786639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Vibrio"],"organizations":["AMR"],"locations":["Nairobi","Kenya"],"keyphrases":["surveillance surrogate","metagenomic surveillance approach","importance of global disease pathogen surveillance","ongoing clinical infectious disease surveillance","comprehensive infectious disease agent surveillance system","number of bacterial pathogens","urban informal settlements","disease prevention","real-time global genomics-based surveillance","bacterial associated antimicrobial resistance genes","settings","temporal metagenomic analysis of urban sewage","limited access","health care","parasitic pathogens","infectious diseases","higher abundances of AMR genes","Data","real time","monitoring circulating pathogens","Significant increased abundances","putative pathogen","number of emerging","parasites of medical importance","Traditional population-based methods","potential","Kibera","human feces","mixture of surface water runoff","determinants","Cryptosporidium","pathogenic microorganisms","paradigm shift","viruses","conjunction","Kenya","study period","Giardia spp","weeks","important events","Nairobi","large variation","rotavirus","environments","treatment","CONCLUSION","Vibrio cholerae","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Multiple common viral respiratory diseases (CVRDs) cause huge economic losses in the poultry industry. The prevalence of CVRDs in many countries, including Pakistan, is not clearly understood. RESULTS: Incidences of 5 chicken respiratory viruses: avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV/AAVV-1), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) were assessed on commercial Pakistani farms with respiratory problems from 2014 through to 2016. While AIV and AAVV-1 were frequently detected (16 to 17% of farms), IBV and aMPV were rarely detected (in 3 to 5% of farms) and ILTV was not detected. We characterized H9 AIV of the G1 lineage, genotype VII AAVV-1, GI-13 IBV, and type B aMPV strains with very little genetic variability in the 2-year study period. Co-infections with AIV and AAVV-1 were common and wild type AAVV-1 was detected despite the use of vaccines. Control measures to limit the virus burden in chicken flocks are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that AIV (H9), AAVV-1, IBV and aMPV are prevalent in commercial poultry in Pakistan. Further studies are necessary to assess circulating strains, economic losses caused by infections and coinfections of these pathogens, and the costs and benefits of countermeasures. Furthermore, veterinarians and farmers should be informed of the pathogens circulating in the field and hence advised on the use of vaccines.","publish_time":"2019-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Umar, Sajid; Teillaud, Ang\u00E9lique; Aslam, Hassan Bin; Guerin, Jean-Luc; Ducatez, Mariette F.","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bb39b846b0bd9548526bad9e74fed1e4a8ac4cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6802313.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6802313/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV","H9 AIV","virus burden","wild type AAVV","avian influenza virus","infectious laryngotracheitis virus","infectious bronchitis virus","commercial poultry","poultry farmers","Newcastle disease virus","type B aMPV strains","chicken respiratory viruses","Viral diseases","Multiple common viral respiratory diseases","respiratory problems","poultry industry","circulating strains","commercial Pakistani farms","pathogens","ILTV","use of vaccines","cause huge economic losses","avian metapneumovirus","prevalence of CVRDs","chicken flocks","Co-infections","matter of great concern","little genetic variability","genotype","G1 lineage","Incidences","coinfections","NDV","GI","year study period","costs","studies","BACKGROUND","Control measures","countries","RESULTS","data","benefits of countermeasures","field","CONCLUSIONS","veterinarians"],"language":"en"},

The detection of both antigens and antibodies in SARS\u2010CoV from human specimens with suspected SARS plays an important role in preventing infection. We developed a novel rapid immunochromatographic test (RICT) based on the sandwich format enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with an all\u2010in\u2010one device for detecting the native nucleocapsid antigen (N\u2010Ag) of SARS\u2010CoV using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), which we produced by immunizing recombinant N\u2010Ag to mice. RICT is a qualitative assay for respiratory aspirates and serum specimens. With this assay, a positive result can be judged subjectively by the appearance of a blue line on the device 15 min after the sample is applied. RICT with several pairs of MoAbs showed a high sensitivity for the detection of recombinant N\u2010Ag as well as viral N\u2010Ag of SARS\u2010CoV. rSN122 and rSN21\u20102 were the best MoAbs for immobilized antibody and enzyme labeling, respectively. With regard to analytical sensitivity, RICT detected N\u2010Ag at 31 pg/mL for recombinant N\u2010Ag, and at 1.99\u00D710(2) TCID(50)/mL for SARS\u2010CoV. The specificity of RICT was 100% when 150 human sera and 50 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NSPs) were used.

In this study, we focused on highly conserved nonstructural protein 16 (NSP16), a viral 2\u2032O-methyltransferase (2\u2032O-MTase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection. Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif in the conserved KDKE motif of Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogenesis. While the absence of 2\u2032O-MTase activity had only a marginal impact on propagation and replication in Vero cells, dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV demonstrated significant attenuation relative to the control both in primary human airway cell cultures and in vivo. Further examination indicated that dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV had a type I interferon (IFN)-based attenuation and was partially restored in the absence of molecules of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats. Importantly, the robust attenuation permitted the use of dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from a challenge with a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain. These studies demonstrate the importance of the conserved 2\u2032O-MTase activity for CoV pathogenesis and highlight NSP16 as a conserved universal target for rapid live attenuated vaccine design in an expanding CoV outbreak setting. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus (CoV) emergence in both humans and livestock represents a significant threat to global public health, as evidenced by the sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and swine delta CoV in the 21st century. These studies describe an approach that effectively targets the highly conserved 2\u2032O-MTase activity of CoVs for attenuation. With clear understanding of the IFN/IFIT (IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats)-based mechanism, NSP16 mutants provide a suitable target for a live attenuated vaccine platform, as well as therapeutic development for both current and future emergent CoV strains. Importantly, other approaches targeting other conserved pan-CoV functions have not yet proven effective against MERS-CoV, illustrating the broad applicability of targeting viral 2\u2032O-MTase function across CoVs.","publish_time":"2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menachery, Vineet D.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Mitchell, Hugh D.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Leist, Sarah R.; Yount, Boyd L.; Graham, Rachel L.; McAnarney, Eileen T.; Stratton, Kelly G.; Cockrell, Adam S.; Debbink, Kari; Sims, Amy C.; Waters, Katrina M.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28a98145eda693bae14b52abfc3d37ced6c5fd90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5687918.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00346-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29152578/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN/IFIT"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV pathogenesis","SARS-CoV","conserved pan-CoV functions","swine delta CoV","use of dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV","mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain","expanding CoV outbreak setting","future emergent CoV strains","O-MTase activity of CoVs","conserved KDKE motif of Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","O-MTase function","sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV","based attenuation","O-methyltransferase","conserved universal target","conserved nonstructural protein","robust attenuation","viral infection","live attenuated vaccine platform","IFN-induced proteins","significant attenuation relative","NSP16 mutants","rapid live attenuated vaccine design","therapeutic design","tetratricopeptide repeats","studies","suitable target","key motif","significant threat","critical functions","based mechanism","therapeutic development","absence of molecules","IMPORTANCE Coronavirus","possibility of common targets","control","replication","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","Vero cells","IFIT","challenge","marginal impact","primary human airway cell cultures","propagation","livestock","genetic elements necessary","mixture","humans","interferon","global public health","type","novel genes","immune modulation","effect","broad applicability","D130A","clear understanding","century","approaches","examination","reverse genetics","Coronaviruses","study"],"language":"en"},

Thus a challenge study inducing WSSV in juvenile white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was established, setting 4 groups: challenged \u2014 not treated and unchallenged, untreated control groups and two experimental ones (E1 and E2) both treated with diammonium glycyrrhizic acid, extracted from licorice with added vitamins and oligoelements, and as in-feed medication. Group E1 received diammonium glycyrrhizic acid included in their daily feed, starting 17days before challenge with WSSV and maintaining the treatment for further 5days after the end of the trial, which was set on day 18. Group E2 received this medication as group E1 throughout the trial, but starting 1day before the challenge with WSSV. The group with highest surviving median values was E1, amounting two times the survival median in comparison with the control groups (P=0.007). Also a statistical difference was found in terms of survival means in favor of group E1 as compared to group E2. Macroscopic and histopathological findings revealed lesions compatible with WSSV and similar mortality in the challenged untreated group. These findings were highly reduced or inexistent in mortality analyzed from groups E1 as well as in the unchallenged \u2014 untreated control group and greatly reduced in group E2. Considering the apparent high efficacy observed and that glycyrrhizic acid and mineral and vitamin components added as treatment, and taking as an advantage that this preparation has been regarded as nutraceuticals, it is here proposed that large scale trials should be conducted to evaluate the effects here observed in commercial and larger scale shrimp farms.","publish_time":"2014-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ocampo, Luis; Chavez, Baltazar; Tapia, Graciela; Ibarra, Cuauhtemoc; Sumano, H\u00E9ctor","journal":"Aquaculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/086cbfce60ba5a4b5a6376198d541ac635c6ebe8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127188.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848614001082; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0044848614001082; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.03.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287456/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WSSV","Group E1","Group E2"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Group E2","favor of group E1","WSSV","groups E1","challenged untreated group","untreated control groups","diammonium glycyrrhizic acid","juvenile white shrimp","survival median","challenge study","days","feed medication","larger scale shrimp farms","shrimp viral disease","similar mortality","terms of survival","histopathological findings","daily feed","added vitamins","white spot syndrome","large scale trials","highest surviving median values","lesions compatible","therapeutic drug-based treatments","licorice","comparison","experimental ones","lack of preventive","vitamin components","times","Litopenaeus vannamei","oligoelements","apparent high efficacy","statistical difference","preparation","Abstract","effects","advantage","end","nutraceuticals"],"language":"en"},

Background Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel parvovirus that is associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal tract disease. Objectives To investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of HBoV amongst hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in Cambodia. Study Design Samples were collected from 2773 patients of all ages hospitalised with symptoms of ALRI between 2007 and 2009. All samples were screened by multiplex RT\u2010PCR/PCR for 18 respiratory viruses. All samples positive for HBoV were sequenced and included in this study. Results Of the samples tested, 43 (1\u00B75%) were positive for HBoV. The incidence of HBoV did not vary between the consecutive seasons investigated, and HBoV infections were detected year\u2010round. The incidence of HBoV infection was highest in patients aged \u003C2 years, with pneumonia or bronchopneumonia the most common clinical diagnosis, regardless of age. A total of 19 patients (44%) were co\u2010infected with HBoV and an additional respiratory pathogen. All isolates were classified as HBoV type 1 (HBoV\u20101). High conservation between Cambodian NP1 and V1V2 gene sequences was observed. Conclusions Human bocavirus infection can result in serious illness, however is frequently detected in the context of viral co\u2010infection. Specific studies are required to further understand the true pathogenesis of HBoV in the context of severe respiratory illness.","publish_time":"2012-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arnott, Alicia; Vong, Sirenda; Rith, Sareth; Naughtin, Monica; Ly, Sowath; Guillard, Bertrand; Deubel, Vincent; Buchy, Philippe","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a6a728d46caa15618a80746cdac1b0a697f188c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780762.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00369.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531100/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Study Design","ALRI","RT\u2010PCR/PCR"],"locations":["Cambodia"],"keyphrases":["HBoV infections","HBoV type","incidence of HBoV infection","Respiratory Viruses","genetic diversity of HBoV","true pathogenesis of HBoV","acute lower respiratory infections","additional respiratory pathogen","context of severe respiratory illness","samples positive","Conclusions Human bocavirus infection","hospitalized patients","Background Human bocavirus","Study Design Samples","context of viral co\u2010infection","PCR","symptoms of ALRI","serious illness","all\u2010ages population","Cambodian NP1","bronchopneumonia","V1V2 gene sequences","common clinical diagnosis","High conservation","years","prevalence","multiplex RT","consecutive seasons","novel parvovirus","gastrointestinal tract disease","Arnott","Objectives","isolates","Influenza","Specific studies","paper","Results","total"],"language":"en"},

It is noteworthy that all mechanisms appear to utilize host membranes as a site of replication. Membranes appear to function not only as a way of compartmentalizing virus RNA replication but also appear to have a central role in the organization and functioning of the replication complex, and further studies in this area are needed. Within virus supergroups, similarities are evident between animal and plant viruses\u2014for example, in the nature and arrangements of replication genes and in sequence similarities of functional domains. However, it is also clear that there has been considerable divergence, even within supergroups. For example, the animal alpha-viruses have evolved to encode proteinases which play a central controlling function in the replication cycle, whereas this is not common in the plant alpha-like viruses and even when it occurs, as in the tymoviruses, the strategies that have evolved appear to be significantly different. Some of the divergence could be host-dependent and the increasing interest in the role of host proteins in replication should be fruitful in revealing how different systems have evolved. Finally, there are virus supergroups that appear to have no close relatives between animals and plants, such as the animal coronavirus-like supergroup and the plant carmo-like supergroup.","publish_time":"1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buck, Kenneth W.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/874ccdebc62485c600681ddf61b6a62207bab6cc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352708607368; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352708607368","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication cycle","replication complex","site of replication","plant viruses","arrangements of replication genes","way of compartmentalizing virus RNA replication","animal alpha-viruses","virus supergroups","plant alpha","host membranes","eukaryotic positive-stranded RNA viruses","animal coronavirus","example","central role","plant carmo","role of host proteins","central controlling function","sequence similarities of functional domains","considerable divergence","different systems","plants","organization","functioning","nature","proteinases","close relatives","experimental data","nucleotides","animals","mechanism of polymerization","studies","mechanisms","Publisher Summary","tymoviruses","strategies","area"],"language":"en"},

Over 1,000 patients died of the SARS virus, representing 10% of infected people. Like other coronaviruses, the SARS virus also utilizes a surface glycoprotein, namely the spike protein, to infect host cells. The spike protein of SARS virus consists of 1,255 amino acid residues and can be divided into two sub-domains, S1 and S2. The S1 domain mediates the binding of the virus to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is abundantly distributed on the surface of human lung cells. The S2 domain mediates membrane fusion between the virus and the host cell. Hence two strategies can be used to block the infection of the SARS virus, either by interfering with the binding of the S1 domain to the receptor or by blocking the fusion of the virus with the cell membrane mediated by the S2 domain. Several antibodies against the S1 domain have been generated and all of them are able to neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo using animal models. Unfortunately, point mutations have been identified in the S1 domain, so that the virus isolated in the future may not be recognized by these antibodies. As no mutation has been found in the S2 domain indicating that this region is more conserved than the S1 domain, it may be a better target for antibody binding.

This method uses 4 distinct hydrolysis probes to detect 3 leading causes of community-acquired pneumonia. The assay was evaluated for specificity and sensitivity by testing against 35 related organisms, a dilution series of each specific target and 197 clinical specimens.

The analytical sensitivity for specific pathogen targets in both the singleplex and multiplex was identical (50 fg), while efficiencies ranged from 82% to 97% for the singleplex assays and from 90% to 100% for the multiplex assay. The clinical sensitivity of the multiplex assay was improved for the Pan-Leg and CP-Arg targets when compared to the singleplex. The MP181 assay displayed equivalent performance.

Here we emphasize that the nasal cavity olfactory epithelium is the likely site of enhanced binding of SARS-CoV-2. Multiple non-neuronal cell types present in the olfactory epithelium express two host receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteases, that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 binding, replication, and accumulation. This may be the underlying mechanism for the recently reported cases of smell dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the possibility of subsequent brain infection should be considered which begins in olfactory neurons. In addition, we discuss the possibility that olfactory receptor neurons may initiate rapid immune responses at early stages of the disease.

We use the quantitative landscape of the disease spreading in China as a benchmark and utilize infection data from eight countries to estimate the complete evolution of the infection in each of these countries. The analysis predicts successfully both the expected number of daily infections per country and, perhaps more importantly, the duration of the epidemic in each country.

Sixteen calves received 0 or 60 mL of 1:1 fish and flaxseed oil with 200 mg of \u03B1-tocopherol in 2.8 L of colostrum within 6 h after birth. Colostrum was \u003E22% on the Brix scale. Blood was sampled on d 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21 after birth for assessment of plasma polyunsaturated FA, \u03B1-tocopherol, total serum protein, and oxidant status index, an indirect indicator of oxidative stress that examines the balance between the concentration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and antioxidant capacity in serum. Health was observed daily. Weight and hip height were recorded at birth, 3 wk, and 8 wk. Data were analyzed with a Mixed procedure of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Treatment did not alter concentration of total protein in blood serum, prevalence of diarrhea or other signs of disease, or rate of growth. Feeding n-3 FA and \u03B1-tocopherol increased plasma concentrations of the n-3 FA, including \u03B1-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids, with a concomitant decrease in oxidant status index during the first week of life. Concentrations of \u03B1-tocopherol decreased with supplementation, but all calves maintained adequate concentrations. Oxidant status index of treated calves returned to the level of control calves by d 14.

Limited preemptive knowledge impeded the understanding of PEDV introduction, spread, and prospective economic impacts in the United States. To assess these impacts, this article reviews the timeline of PEDV in the United States and the corresponding impacts. PEDV is a supply-impacting disease and is not demand inhibiting, as pork demand remained strong since PEDV first appeared. Pig losses reached significant levels during September 2013 through August 2014, with the majority of pork production impacts occurring in 2014. PEDV had differing impacts for subsectors of the pork industry. A budget model demonstrates that producers could have had pig losses and decreases in productivity proportionally smaller than price increases, resulting in net returns above what was expected before the major outbreak of PEDV. Previous literature is reviewed to identify the potential main industry beneficiaries of the PEDV outbreaks in the United States. As a result of reduced volumes of available pig and hog supplies, reductions in annual returns likely occurred for packers, processors, distributors, and retailers. In addition, pork consumers who experienced reduced-supply-induced pork-price increases were likely harmed directly by higher prices paid for pork and indirectly as prices of competing meats were also likely strengthened by PEDV. This article also identifies future considerations motivated by the appearance of PEDV in the United States, such as discussions of industry-wide efficiency and competitive advantage, the future role of PEDV vaccines, enhancement in biosecurity measures, and consumer perceptions of food safety and insecurity.","publish_time":"2015-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schulz, Lee L.; Tonsor, Glynn T.","journal":"J Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d8b3c17cb7f1d80f2a63401ad5a46e90a3565a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109690.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26641031/; https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2015-9136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["United States","U.S."],"keyphrases":["PEDV outbreaks","appearance of PEDV","timeline of PEDV","United States","pork industry","understanding of PEDV introduction","major outbreak of PEDV","pork demand","future role of PEDV vaccines","pork consumers","majority of pork production impacts","corresponding impacts","induced pork-price increases","Pig losses","prospective economic impacts","reduced-supply","discussions of industry","article","result of reduced volumes of available pig","hog supplies","potential main industry beneficiaries","annual returns","future considerations","net returns","hog population","higher prices","supply-impacting disease","prices of competing meats","enhancement","biosecurity measures","competitive advantage","reductions","consumer perceptions of food safety","wide efficiency","inhibiting","productivity","insecurity","processors","packers","Limited preemptive knowledge","producers","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","subsectors","distributors","significant levels","addition","budget model","retailers","Previous literature"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, F16 orthologs encoded by other poxviruses show only marginally significant similarity to serine recombinases, lack essential amino acids of the active site and are most likely inactive derivatives of serine recombinases. Nevertheless, the conservation of F16L in non-avian poxviruses suggested an important function. However, a VACV mutant with the F16L gene knocked out replicated normally in dividing and quiescent cells. The F16 protein was synthesized early after infection and detected in virus cores.

The monitoring of emergence events is subject to ascertainment bias, whether at the level of species discovery, emerging disease events, or disease outbreaks in human populations. Disease surveillance is generally performed post hoc, driven by a response to recent events and by the availability of detection and identification technologies. Additionally, the inventory of pathogens that exist in mammalian and other reservoirs is incomplete, and identifying those with the potential to cause disease in humans is rarely possible in advance. A major step in understanding the burden and diversity of zoonotic infections, the local behavioral and demographic risks of infection, and the risk of emergence of these pathogens in human populations is to establish surveillance networks in populations that maintain regular contact with diverse animal populations, and to simultaneously characterize pathogen diversity in human and animal populations. Vietnam has been an epicenter of disease emergence over the last decade, and practices at the human/animal interface may facilitate the likelihood of spillover of zoonotic pathogens into humans. To tackle the scientific issues surrounding the origins and emergence of zoonotic infections in Vietnam, we have established The Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic Infections (VIZIONS). This countrywide project, in which several international institutions collaborate with Vietnamese organizations, is combining clinical data, epidemiology, high-throughput sequencing, and social sciences to address relevant one-health questions. Here, we describe the primary aims of the project, the infrastructure established to address our scientific questions, and the current status of the project. Our principal objective is to develop an integrated approach to the surveillance of pathogens circulating in both human and animal populations and assess how frequently they are exchanged. This infrastructure will facilitate systematic investigations of pathogen ecology and evolution, enhance understanding of viral cross-species transmission events, and identify relevant risk factors and drivers of zoonotic disease emergence.","publish_time":"2015-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rabaa, Maia A.; Tue, Ngo Tri; Phuc, Tran My; Carrique-Mas, Juan; Saylors, Karen; Cotten, Matthew; Bryant, Juliet E.; Nghia, Ho Dang Trung; Cuong, Nguyen Van; Pham, Hong Anh; Berto, Alessandra; Phat, Voong Vinh; Dung, Tran Thi Ngoc; Bao, Long Hoang; Hoa, Ngo Thi; Wertheim, Heiman; Nadjm, Behzad; Monagin, Corina; van Doorn, H.

World Health Organization (WHO)-defined \u2018aerosol generating procedures\u2019 (AGPs) are thought to increase the risk of aerosol transmission to HCWs, but there are presently insufficient data to quantify risk accurately or establish a hierarchy of risk-prone procedures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study measured the amount of H1N1 (2009) RNA in aerosols in the vicinity of H1N1 positive patients undergoing AGPs to help quantify the potential risk of transmission to HCWs. There were 99 sampling occasions (windows) producing a total of 198 May stages for analysis in the size ranges 0.86\u20137.3 \u00B5m. Considering stages 2 (4\u20137.3 \u00B5m) and 3 (0.86\u20134 \u00B5m) as comprising one sample, viral RNA was detected in 14 (14.1%) air samples from 10 (25.6%) patients. Twenty three air samples were collected while potential AGPs were being performed of which 6 (26.1%) contained viral RNA; in contrast, 76 May samples were collected when no WHO 2009 defined AGP was being performed of which 8 (10.5%) contained viral RNA (unadjusted OR = 2.84 (95% CI 1.11\u20137.24) adjusted OR = 4.31 (0.83\u201322.5)). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: With our small sample size we found that AGPs do not significantly increase the probability of sampling an H1N1 (2009) positive aerosol (OR (95% CI) = 4.31 (0.83\u201322.5). Although the probability of detecting positive H1N1 (2009) positive aerosols when performing various AGPs on intensive care patients above the baseline rate (i.e. in the absence of AGPs) did not reach significance, there was a trend towards hierarchy of AGPs, placing bronchoscopy and respiratory and airway suctioning above baseline (background) values. Further, larger studies are required but these preliminary findings may be of benefit to infection control teams.","publish_time":"2013-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Katy-Anne; Pappachan, John V.; Bennett, Allan M.; Mittal, Himanshu; Macken, Susan; Dove, Brian K.; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S.; Copley, Vicky R.; O\u2019Brien, Sarah; Hoffman, Peter; Parks, Simon; Bentley, Andrew; Isalska, Barbara; Thomson, Gail","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f380911a4cf1b78dce1c016c1c0cc2f95a15f7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3571988.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23418548/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056278","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","AGP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive H1N1","hierarchy of AGPs","potential AGPs","various AGPs","absence of AGPs","viral RNA","vicinity of H1N1 positive patients","positive aerosols","HCWs","hierarchy of risk","risk of aerosol transmission","\u00B5m","potential risk of transmission","air samples","intensive care patients","Nosocomial infection of health","BACKGROUND","SIGNIFICANCE","stages","probability of sampling","small sample size","World Health Organization","care workers","baseline rate","public health policy makers","size ranges","preliminary findings","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","sampling occasions","defined AGP","outbreaks of respiratory infections","infection control teams","airway suctioning","significant concern","benefit","bronchoscopy","total","analysis","study","Influenza","windows","METHODOLOGY","values","prone procedures","trend","contrast","larger studies","insufficient data","CONCLUSIONS","procedures\u2019"],"language":"en"},

Genotyping of 41 chimpanzees and examination of 24 published chimpanzee genomes from subspecies across Africa showed universal homozygosity for the cadherin-related family member 3 CDHR3-Y(529) allele, which increases risk for rhinovirus C infection and asthma in human children. These results indicate that chimpanzees exhibit a species-wide genetic susceptibility to rhinovirus C and that this virus, heretofore considered a uniquely human pathogen, can cross primate species barriers and threatens wild apes.

METHODS: We prospectively studied the aetiology of febrile illness in 677 children aged 2\u201359 months with acute uncomplicated fever managed by IMCI (Integrated Management of Childhood Illness) guidelines in Zanzibar, using point-of-care tests, urine culture, blood-PCR, chest X-ray (CXR) of IMCI-pneumonia classified patients, and multiple quantitative (q)PCR investigations of nasopharyngeal (NPH) (all patients) and rectal (GE) swabs (diarrhoea patients). For comparison, we also performed NPH and GE qPCR analyses in 167 healthy community controls. Final fever diagnoses were retrospectively established based on all clinical and laboratory data. Clinical outcome was assessed during a 14-day follow-up. The utility of IMCI for identifying infections presumed to require antibiotics was evaluated. FINDINGS: NPH-qPCR and GE-qPCR detected \u22651 pathogen in 657/672 (98%) and 153/164 (93%) of patients and 158/166 (95%) and 144/165 (87%) of controls, respectively. Overall, 57% (387/677) had IMCI-pneumonia, but only 12% (42/342) had CXR-confirmed pneumonia. Two patients were positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Respiratory syncytial virus (24.5%), influenza A/B (22.3%), rhinovirus (10.5%) and group-A streptococci (6.4%), CXR-confirmed pneumonia (6.2%), Shigella (4.3%) were the most common viral and bacterial fever diagnoses, respectively. Blood-PCR conducted in a sub-group of patients (n = 83) without defined fever diagnosis was negative for rickettsiae, chikungunya, dengue, Rift Valley fever and West Nile viruses. Antibiotics were prescribed to 500 (74%) patients, but only 152 (22%) had an infection retrospectively considered to require antibiotics. Clinical outcome was generally good. However, two children died. Only 68 (11%) patients remained febrile on day 3 and three of them had verified fever on day 14. An additional 29 (4.5%) children had fever relapse on day 14. Regression analysis determined C-reactive Protein (CRP) as the only independent variable significantly associated with CXR-confirmed pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on uncomplicated febrile illness in African children that both applied a comprehensive laboratory panel and a healthy control group. A majority of patients had viral respiratory tract infection. Pathogens were frequently detected by qPCR also in asymptomatic children, demonstrating the importance of incorporating controls in fever aetiology studies. The precision of IMCI for identifying infections requiring antibiotics was low.","publish_time":"2016-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elfving, Kristina; Shakely, Deler; Andersson, Maria; Baltzell, Kimberly; Ali, Abdullah S.; Bachelard, Marc; Falk, Kerstin I.; Ljung, Annika; Msellem, Mwinyi I.; Omar, Rahila S.; Parola, Philippe; Xu, Weiping; Petzold, Max; Trollfors, Birger; Bj\u00F6rkman, Anders; Lindh, Magnus; M\u00E5rtensson, Andreas","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bb362d1be223686ad4467e317cf5abb8383ab3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4731140.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26821179/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0146054","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IMCI","GE","Rift Valley"],"locations":["West Nile","Africa"],"keyphrases":["fever relapse","diarrhoea patients","majority of patients","IMCI-pneumonia","acute uncomplicated fever","fever aetiology studies","sub-group of patients","bacterial fever diagnoses","Final fever diagnoses","CXR","antibiotics","Rift Valley fever","uncomplicated febrile illness","defined fever diagnosis","GE-qPCR","African children","NPH-qPCR","asymptomatic children","aetiology of febrile illness","utility of IMCI","precision of IMCI","causes of uncomplicated childhood febrile illness","GE qPCR analyses","large proportion of children","blood-PCR","Clinical outcome","day follow-up","level of care","Integrated Management of Childhood Illness","care tests","healthy control group","healthy community controls","Zanzibar","infections","study","viral respiratory tract infection","PCR investigations of nasopharyngeal","primary health care facilities","laboratory data","comprehensive laboratory panel","low malaria transmission","Respiratory syncytial virus","Africa present","rickettsiae","chikungunya","dengue","guidelines","urine culture","West Nile viruses","chest X-ray","CRP","C-reactive Protein","dramatic change","importance","Regression analysis","fact","point","swabs","months","independent variable","areas","Plasmodium falciparum","FINDINGS","influenza","rhinovirus","streptococci","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","comparison","Pathogens","Shigella"],"language":"en"},

They are also detected outside of exacerbation. Alteration of anti-viral response in asthmatic patients has been shown although the mechanisms responsible for this defect remain unclear. The objective of this study was to compare in virus-infected and not-infected allergic asthmatic children, aged 6 to 16 years, admitted to hospital for a severe exacerbation, the innate immune response and especially the expression of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and their function. METHODS: Virus identification was performed both during the exacerbation and at steady state (eight weeks later). Data assessed at both periods included clinical features, anti-viral response and inflammation (in sputum and plasma), and PRR expression/function in blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Viruses were identified in 46 out of 72 children (median age 8.9 years) during exacerbation, and among them, in 17 at steady state. IFN-\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3 and IL-29 levels in sputum and plasma were similar between infected and not infected patients at both times, as well as the expression of TLR3, RIG-I and MDA5 in blood monocytes and dendritic cells. Airway inflammation in infected patients was characterized by significantly higher IL-5 concentration and eosinophil count. Compared to patients only infected at exacerbation, the re-infected children significantly exhibited lower levels of IFN-\u03B3 in plasma and sputum at exacerbation associated with modifications in PRR expression and function in blood mononuclear cells. These re-infected patients also presented an airway neutrophilic inflammation at steady state. CONCLUSION: Our results reports in asthmatic children that impaired anti-viral response during virus-induced exacerbation is more pronounced in a subgroup of patients prone to re-infection by virus. This subgroup is characterized by altered PRR function and a different pattern of airway inflammation.

In the early summer of 2015, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) struck South Korea, and students of Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine (SKKUSOM) were at risk of contracting the disease. The purpose of this report is to share SKKUSOM\u2019s experience against the MERS outbreak and provide suggestions for medical schools to consider in the face of similar challenges. METHODS: Through a process of reflection-on-action, we examined SKKUSOM\u2019s efforts to avoid student infection during the MERS outbreak and derived a few practical guidelines that medical schools can adopt to ensure student safety in outbreaks of infectious disease. RESULTS: The school leadership conducted ongoing risk assessment and developed contingency plans to balance student safety and continuity in medical education. They rearranged the clerkships to another hospital and offered distant lectures and tutorials. Five suggestions are extracted for medical schools to consider in infection outbreaks: instant cessation of clinical clerkships; rational decision making on a school closure; use of information technology; constant communication with hospitals; and open communication with faculty, staff, and students. CONCLUSION: Medical schools need to take the initiative and actively seek countermeasures against student infection. It is essential that medical schools keep constant communication with their index hospitals and the involved personnel. In order to assure student learning, medical schools may consider offering distant education with online technology.","publish_time":"2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Seung Won; Jang, Hye Won; Choe, Yon Ho; Lee, Kyung Soo; Ahn, Yong Chan; Chung, Myung Jin; Lee, Kyu-Sung; Lee, Kyunghoon; Han, Taehee","journal":"Korean J Med Educ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f7e3be54c93d119c3a1ddb753aa5394878a2bbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4951746.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240893/; https://doi.org/10.3946/kjme.2016.30","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["medical schools","medical students","medical education","student infection","student safety","infection outbreaks","student learning","outbreaks of infectious disease","constant communication","MERS outbreak","open communication","school leadership","school closure","index hospitals","distant education","suggestions","PURPOSE","students of Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine","instant cessation of clinical clerkships","information technology","distant lectures","SKKUSOM\u2019s experience","online technology","SKKUSOM\u2019s efforts","involved personnel","ongoing risk assessment","management of healthcare personnel protection","rational decision","contingency plans","Middle East respiratory syndrome","South Korea","faculty","continuity","practical guidelines","action","staff","initiative","early summer","process of reflection","tutorials","RESULTS","report","countermeasures","order","face of similar challenges","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In order to identify such cleavages within the ORF1 polyprotein mediated by 3CLpro, the proteinase was expressed in bacteria, purified and used in trans cleavage assays with polyprotein fragments lacking the 3CLP domain as targets. The proteinase was expressed as a polyprotein fragment which was able to process during expression in bacterial cells, releasing mature 3CLpro. A histidine (His6) tag was introduced close to the C-terminus of the proteinase to aid purification. Processing demonstrated by the tagged proteinase was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type enzyme indicating that the site chosen for the tag was permissive. From these studies we were able to demonstrate trans cleavages consistent with the use of most of the previously predicted or identified sites within the open reading frame of gene 1. This tentatively completes the processing map for the ORF1 region with respect to 3CLpro.","publish_time":"1999-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tibbles, K.

In animal models anti\u2010pyretic treatment increases mortality from influenza. We investigated the effects of paracetamol on viral and clinical outcomes in adults with influenza infection. METHODS: This is a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial of adults aged 18\u201365 years with influenza\u2010like illness and positive influenza rapid antigen test. Treatments were 1 g paracetamol four times a day, or matching placebo, for 5 days. Pernasal swabs were taken for influenza quantitative RT\u2010PCR at Baseline and Days 1, 2 and 5. Temperature and symptom scores were recorded for 5\u201314 days or time of resolution respectively. The primary outcome variable was area under the curve (AUC) for quantitative PCR log(10) viral load from Baseline to Day 5. RESULTS: A total of 80 participants were randomized: no one was lost to follow up, and one withdrew after 4 days. There were 22 and 24 participants who were influenza PCR\u2010positive in placebo and in paracetamol groups respectively. Mean (SD) AUC PCR log(10) viral load was 4.40 (0.91) in placebo and 4.64 (0.88) in paracetamol; difference was \u22120.24, 95% CI: \u22120.78 to 0.29, P = 0.36. In all participants there were no differences in symptom scores, temperature, time to resolution of illness and health status, with no interaction between randomized treatment and whether influenza was detected by PCR. CONCLUSION: Regular paracetamol had no effect on viral shedding, temperature or clinical symptoms in patients with PCR\u2010confirmed influenza. There remains an insufficient evidence base for paracetamol use in influenza infection.

One intriguing topic is the correlation between men and women\u0027s knowledge on TB and their health-care seeking behaviors. METHODS: Two cross-sectional studies were separately carried out in Yangzhong County, a rural area of China. One study, by using systematic sampling method, including 1,200 subjects, was conducted to investigate the TB knowledge among general population. Another study in the same source population screened 33,549 people aged 15 years or over among 20 stratified cluster-sampled villages for identifying prolonged cough patients at households and individual interviews were then carried out. Gender difference in the knowledge of TB and health-care seeking behaviors was analyzed particularly. RESULTS: Among general population, only 16.0% (men 17.1% vs. women 15.0%) knew the prolonged cough with the duration of 3 weeks or longer was a symptom for suspicious TB. Fewer women than men knew the local appointed health facility for TB diagnosis and treatment as well as the current free TB service policy. Moreover, women were less likely to learn information about TB and share it with others on their own initiatives. On the contrary, after the onset of the prolonged cough, women (79.2%) were more likely to seek health-care than men (58.6%) did. However, a large part of women preferred to visit the lower level non-hospital health facilities at first such as village clinics and drugstores. CONCLUSION: TB and DOTS program were not well known by rural Chinese. Gender issues should be considered to reduce diagnostic delay of TB and improve both men and women\u0027s access to qualified health facility for TB care. Strengthening awareness of TB and improving the accessibility of health-care service is essential in TB control strategy, especially under the current vertical TB control system.","publish_time":"2008-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jianming; Fei, Yang; Shen, Hongbing; Xu, Biao","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f7ed2037968c63fa97eb6fc7c35e9738a654541.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2577657.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18842127/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-8-354","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["TB care","TB knowledge","knowledge of TB","TB diagnosis","suspicious TB","awareness of TB","TB control strategy","diagnostic delay of TB","patient\u0027s health-care","national TB control program","accessibility of health service","care service","current vertical TB control system","current free TB service policy","qualified health facility","local appointed health facility","Fewer women","behaviors","women\u0027s knowledge","general population","lower level non-hospital health facilities","prolonged cough patients","source population","study","rural area of China","women\u0027s access","DOTS program","rural Chinese","Gender difference","Gender issues","detection","treatment","passive case","stratified cluster-sampled villages","households","correlation","individual interviews","systematic sampling method","Yangzhong County","years","onset","village clinics","subjects","guidelines","people","weeks","intriguing topic","symptom","BACKGROUND","Tuberculosis","duration","CONCLUSION","information","cross-sectional studies","METHODS","drugstores","RESULTS","initiatives"],"language":"en"},

We conducted this study to help paediatricians To help pediatricians understand the conditions of COVID-19 in children, we conducted this study. Methods We retrospectively summarized the characteristics, treatment and outcomes of pediatric cases in Wuhan children\u0027s hospital which was the only designated hospital for children with COVID-19 in Hubei Province. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with clinical outcomes. Results As of February 29, 75 children had been discharged, of which only one was has severe pneumonia and one was critical cases. Children younger than 2 years were more susceptible to COVID-19. All patients have received interferon-\u03B1 nebulization, and eight cases including the severe and critical cases were co-administrated ribavirin. Five patients with mild pneumonia were given arbidol. Twenty-three patients were given traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

We estimated the burden of community-onset RSV-associated hospitalizations among US children aged \u003C2 years by extrapolating rates of RSV-confirmed hospitalizations in 4 surveillance states and using probabilistic multipliers to adjust for ascertainment biases. METHODS: From October 2014 through April 2015, clinician-ordered RSV tests identified laboratory-confirmed RSV hospitalizations among children aged \u003C2 years at 4 influenza hospitalization surveillance network sites. Surveillance populations were used to estimate age-specific rates of RSV-associated hospitalization, after adjusting for detection probabilities. We extrapolated these rates using US census data. RESULTS: We identified 1554 RSV-associated hospitalizations in children aged \u003C2 years. Of these, 27% were admitted to an intensive care unit, 6% needed mechanical ventilation, and 5 died. Most cases (1047/1554; 67%) had no underlying condition. Adjusted age-specific RSV hospitalization rates per 100 000 population were 1970 (95% confidence interval [CI],1787 to 2177), 897 (95% CI, 761 to 1073), 531 (95% CI, 459 to 624), and 358 (95% CI, 317 to 405) for ages 0\u20132, 3\u20135, 6\u201311, and 12\u201323 months, respectively. Extrapolating to the US population, an estimated 49 509\u201359 867 community-onset RSV-associated hospitalizations among children aged \u003C2 years occurred during the 2014\u20132015 season. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of RSV as a cause of hospitalization, especially among children aged \u003C2 months.

BTV can induce an intense cytopathic effect (CPE) in mammalian cells after infection, although Culicoides- or mosquito-derived cell cultures cause non-lytic infection with BTV without CPE. However, little is known about the transcriptome changes in Aedes albopictus cells infected with BTV. METHODS: Transcriptome sequencing was used to identify the expression pattern of mRNA transcripts in A. albopictus cells infected with BTV, given the absence of the Culicoides genome sequence. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to examine the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction was utilized to validate the sequencing data. RESULTS: In total, 51,850,205 raw reads were generated from the BTV infection group and 51,852,293 from the control group. A total of 5769 unigenes were common to both groups; only 779 unigenes existed exclusively in the infection group and 607 in the control group. In total, 380 differentially expressed genes were identified, 362 of which were up-regulated and 18 of which were down-regulated. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes mainly participated in endocytosis, FoxO, MAPK, dorso-ventral axis formation, insulin resistance, Hippo, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: This study represents the first attempt to investigate transcriptome-wide dysregulation in A. albopictus cells infected with BTV. The understanding of BTV pathogenesis and virus\u2013vector interaction will be improved by global transcriptome profiling.

Here we examined the contribution of ERK1/2 in early steps of JUNV and TCRV multiplication. JUNV adsorption, internalization, and uncoating were not affected by treatment of cultured cells with U0126, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In contrast, U0126 caused a marked reduction in viral protein expression and RNA synthesis, while JUNV RNA synthesis was significantly augmented in the presence of an activator of the ERK1/2 pathway. Moreover, U0126 impaired the expression of a reporter gene in a TCRV-based replicon system, confirming the ability of the compound to hinder arenavirus macromolecular synthesis. By using a cell-based assay, we determined that the inhibitor did not affect the translation of a synthetic TCRV-like mRNA. No changes in the phosphorylation pattern of the translation factor eIF2\u03B1 were found in U0126-treated cells. Our results indicate that U0126 impairs viral RNA synthesis, thereby leading to a subsequent reduction in viral protein expression. Thus, we conclude that ERK1/2 signaling activation is required for an efficient arenavirus RNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brunetti, Jes\u00FAs E.; Foscaldi, Sabrina; Quintana, Ver\u00F3nica M.; Scolaro, Luis A.; L\u00F3pez, Nora; Castilla, Viviana","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5c2bc7a07670d6fb970d84a59aab3832752a3f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923493.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5923493/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JUNV","TCRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JUNV RNA synthesis","viral RNA synthesis","viral protein expression","efficient arenavirus RNA synthesis","contribution of ERK1","arenavirus macromolecular synthesis","U0126-treated cells","JUNV adsorption","TCRV multiplication","synthetic TCRV","activated protein kinases","early steps of JUNV","TCRV-based replicon system","inhibitor","activation","pathway","cell-based assay","infection of cell cultures","marked reduction","phosphorylation of mitogen","subsequent reduction","phosphorylation pattern","productive infection","translation factor eIF2\u03B1","treatment of cultured cells","extracellular signal-regulated kinases","MAPKs","arenaviruses Jun\u00EDn","ability","Tacaribe","reporter gene","uncoating","Pichind\u00E9","compound","achievement","internalization","activator","contrast","presence","results","changes","mRNA"],"language":"en"},

We discuss the extant experimental results, limited though they are, to consider the potential applicability of human defensins as antiviral agents. Given their antiviral effects, we propose that basic research be conducted on human defensins that focuses on RNA viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and dengue virus (DENV), which are considered serious human pathogens but have posed huge challenges for vaccine development for different reasons. Concerning the prophylactic and therapeutic applications of defensins, we then discuss the applicability of human defensins as antivirals that has been demonstrated in reports using animal models. Finally, we discuss the potential adjuvant-like activity of human defensins and propose an exploration of the \u2018defensin vaccine\u2019 concept to prime the body with a controlled supply of human defensins. In sum, we suggest a conceptual framework to achieve the practical application of human defensins to combat viral infections.","publish_time":"2018-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Mee Sook; Kim, Jin Il; Lee, Ilseob; Park, Sehee; Bae, Joon-Yong; Park, Man-Seong","journal":"Biomol Ther (Seoul)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9826361eeccaade32208880c9b1907b71bd2cf79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5933891.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933891/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activity of human defensins","potential applicability of human defensins","practical application of human defensins","\u03B2-defensins","controlled supply of human defensins","human immunodeficiency virus","therapeutic applications of defensins","serious human pathogens","dengue virus","respiratory syncytial virus","antiviral agents","antiviral effects","vaccine development","defensin vaccine","potential adjuvant","huge challenges","RNA viruses","body","RSV","IAV","influenza","HIV","different reasons","inducibly express \u03B1","basic research","conceptual framework","exploration","antivirals","antimicrobial peptides","viral infections","reports","innate immunity of hosts","DENV","prophylactic","review","extant experimental results","animal models","sum","Humans","antibacterial activities"],"language":"en"},

Juglanin is a natural product, which is predominantly extracted from Polygonum aviculare, and is considered a functional component among its various compounds. Juglanin has been reported to exert marked protective effects in various diseases via the inhibition of inflammation and tumor cell growth. The present study aimed to explore the effects of juglanin on human skin cancer induced by UV and to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism. In the present study, immunohistochemical analysis, western blot analysis, RT-qPCR analysis and flow cytometry assays were mainly used in vivo and/or in vitro. The results indicated that in mice, UVB exposure increased susceptibility to carcinogens, and accelerated disease pathogenesis. Conversely, juglanin was able to ameliorate this condition via inhibition of inflammation, suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis via p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) blockage, nuclear factor (NF)-\u03BAB inactivation and caspase stimulation in vivo. In addition, in vitro, the present study demonstrated that treatment of UVB-stimulated B16F10 melanoma cells with juglanin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, as well as increased apoptosis via the upregulation of caspase expression and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In addition, juglanin markedly attenuated p38/JNK signaling, inactivated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway and suppressed UVB-induced NF-\u03BAB activation. Taken together, these results indicated the possibility of applying juglanin in combination with UVB as a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing skin cancer.","publish_time":"2018-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Gui-Rong; Zeng, Kang; Lan, Hai-Mei; Wang, Qi","journal":"Int J Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8301fef06e9bbbde5f145096ba75e82f3e0ec160.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5979868.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5979868/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of juglanin","present study","human skin cancer","treatment of UVB","skin injury","lethal form of skin cancer","immunohistochemical analysis","UVB exposure increased susceptibility","suppressed UVB-induced NF-\u03BAB activation","inhibition of inflammation","cell viability","increased apoptosis","JNK","addition","results","RT-qPCR analysis","western blot analysis","N-terminal kinase","suppression of cell proliferation","tumor cell growth","protein kinase B pathway","induction of apoptosis","\u03BAB inactivation","various diseases","caspase stimulation","attenuated p38","various compounds","formation of melanoma","upregulation of caspase expression","marked protective effects","stimulated B16F10 melanoma cells","carcinogens","blockage","nuclear factor","ADP-ribose","potential therapeutic strategy","dose-dependent decrease","mice","combination","condition","flow cytometry assays","accelerated disease pathogenesis","radiation","phosphoinositide","polymerase cleavage","functional component","possibility","underlying molecular mechanism","development","natural product","Polygonum aviculare"],"language":"en"},

Five group-1 HA SS probes, representing five subtypes, were chosen for this analyses. Eighty-four percent of samples analyzed had specific reactivity to at least one probe, with approximately 60% of the samples reactive to H1 probes, and up to 45% reactive to each of the non-circulating subtypes.

Subjects admitted to the adult medicine ward of a tertiary referral hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh from 2008 to 2012 with a diagnosis of one of the six chosen climate-sensitive infectious diseases were enrolled in the study. Climate-related data were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Institute. Disease incidence was then analyzed against mean temperature, humidity and average rainfall for the Sylhet region. Statistical significance was determined using Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square test and ANOVA testing. 5033 patients were enrolled (58% male, 42% female, ratio 1.3:1). All six diseases showed highly significant (p = 0.01) rises in incidence between the study years 2008 (540 cases) and 2012 (1330 cases), compared with no significant rise in overall all-cause hospital admissions in the same period (p = 0.19). The highest number of malaria (135), diarrhea (266) and pneumonia (371) cases occurred during the rainy season. On the other hand, the maximum number of enteric fever (408), encephalitis (183) and meningitis (151) cases occurred during autumn, which follows the rainy season. A positive (P = 0.01) correlation was observed between increased temperature and the incidence of malaria, enteric fever and diarrhea, and a negative correlation with encephalitis, meningitis and pneumonia. Higher humidity correlated (P = 0.01) with a higher number of cases of malaria and diarrhea, but inversely correlated with meningitis and encephalitis. Higher incidences of encephalitis and meningitis occurred while there was low rainfall. Incidences of diarrhea, malaria and enteric fever, increased with rainfall, and then gradually decreased. The findings support a relationship between weather patterns and disease incidence, and provide essential baseline data for future large prospective studies.","publish_time":"2018-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowdhury, Fazle Rabbi; Ibrahim, Quazi Shihab Uddin; Bari, Md.

A retrospective evaluation was performed of patients receiving vv-ECMO at a tertiary hospital in Manchester (UK) between January 2012 and December 2016. Data collected included epidemiological data, microbiological cultures, radiographic findings and outcomes. Cases were classified as proven IPA, putative IPA or Aspergillus colonisation according to a validated clinical algorithm. One hundred thirty-four patients were supported with vv-ECMO, median age of 45.5 years (range 16.4\u201373.4). Ten (7%) patients had putative IPA and nine (7%) had Aspergillus colonisation. Half of the patients with putative IPA lacked classical host risk factors for IPA. The median number of days on ECMO prior to Aspergillus isolation was 5 days. Immunosuppression and influenza A infection were significantly associated with developing IPA in a logistic regression model. Cox regression model demonstrates a three times greater hazard of death associated with IPA. Overall 6-month mortality rate was 38%. Patients with putative IPA and colonised patients had a 6-month mortality rate of 80 and 11%, respectively. Immunosuppression and influenza A infection are independent risk factors for IPA. IPA, but not Aspergillus colonisation, is associated with high long-term mortality in patients supported with vv-ECMO.","publish_time":"2018-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez-Goncer, I.; Thomas, S.; Foden, P.; Richardson, M.

One of the best DNA vaccine delivery systems uses a live bacterial vector as the carrier. The live bacterial vector induces a robust immune response due to its natural characteristics that are recognized by the immune system. Moreover, the route of administration used by the live bacterial vector is through the mucosal route that beneficially induces both mucosal and systemic immune responses. The mucosal route is not invasive, making the vaccine easy to administer, increasing the patient\u2019s acceptance. Lactic acid bacterium is one of the most promising bacteria used as a live bacterial vector.

It is one of the many tools used by animal welfare agencies to decrease shelter euthanasia rates across the country. However, there are few and sometimes conflicting guidelines for either minimum standards or best practices regarding relocation programs. Most operational practices are evolving and are often based on lessons learned. Concerns about the frequency of infectious diseases and the corresponding likelihood of spread are commonly raised in the context of animal relocation. In this study, which followed one relocation program over a 7-month period, highly contagious infectious diseases, feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and ringworm, were uncommon in cats following relocation into one shelter. Upper respiratory infection (URI) was, however, relatively more frequent with younger age, increased time in transport during relocation and increased time spent at the shelter following relocation all associated with increased disease frequency. Accordingly, even in an established relocation program, steps should be taken to mitigate the risk of upper respiratory infection in relocated cats. ABSTRACT: Feline relocation is used increasingly in animal welfare to decrease shelter euthanasia rates and increase positive outcomes. Concerns about infectious disease introduction and transmission are often expressed; however, little research has been conducted on even the baseline prevalence of infectious disease following relocation. This study, which collected data on 430 cats relocated through an established program over 7 months, evaluated the prevalence of upper respiratory infection (URI), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and dermatophytosis at one destination agency. The period prevalence was 25.8% for URI, 1.6% for FPV and 0.9% for dermatophytosis. Mixed-effects logistic regression was performed to investigate factors associated with URI. Younger age, increased time in transport, and increased length of stay at the destination agency were associated with increased URI prevalence following relocation. The findings of this study reveal that certain highly contagious and environmentally persistent infectious diseases, such as FPV and dermatophytosis, are uncommon following relocation in an established program; however, URI in relocated cats should be proactively managed. Animal welfare agencies can use this information to guide shelter and relocation operations and mitigate the impact of URI in relocated cats.","publish_time":"2018-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aziz, Mehnaz; Janeczko, Stephanie; Gupta, Maya","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adab31f0d8b09bc7d087969e7664b22ab584dc81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6025414.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6025414/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URI","FPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Relocation of cats","Feline relocation","relocation operations","relocation programs","established relocation program","uncommon following relocation","context of animal relocation","increased URI prevalence","relocated cats","increased time","FPV","impact of URI","increased disease frequency","animal welfare agencies","increased length","established program","contagious infectious diseases","frequency of infectious diseases","baseline prevalence of infectious disease","prevalence of upper respiratory infection","persistent infectious diseases","shelter euthanasia rates","infectious disease introduction","dermatophytosis","period prevalence","study","risk of upper respiratory infection","feline panleukopenia virus","transport","younger age","destination agency","Concerns","month period","best practices","operational practices","minimum standards","information","kittens","ringworm","new practice","corresponding likelihood of spread","positive outcomes","transmission","months","Mixed-effects logistic regression","conflicting guidelines","SIMPLE SUMMARY","factors","country","tools","steps","findings","data","ABSTRACT","little research","lessons"],"language":"en"},

Three microarray datasets of Rat, Bos Taurus, and Tammar wallaby were used. Samples related to pre-peak (n = 85) and post-peak (n = 24) milk production were selected. Meta-analysis revealed 31 DEGs across the studied species. Interestingly, 10 genes, including MRPS18B, SF1, UQCRC1, NUCB1, RNF126, ADSL, TNNC1, FIS1, HES5 and THTPA, were not detected in original studies that highlights meta-analysis power in biosignature discovery. Common target and regulator analysis highlighted the high connectivity of CTNNB1, CDD4 and LPL as gene network hubs. As data originally came from three different species, to check the effects of heterogeneous data sources on DEGs, 10 attribute weighting (machine learning) algorithms were applied. Attribute weighting results showed that the type of organism had no or little effect on the selected gene list. Systems biology analysis suggested that these DEGs affect the milk production by improving the immune system performance and mammary cell growth. This is the first study employing both meta-analysis and machine learning approaches for comparative analysis of gene expression pattern of mammary glands in two important time points of lactation process.

While the effect of ECM stiffness on many aspects of cellular behavior has been studied previously, how ECM stiffness might mediate susceptibility of host cells to infection by bacterial pathogens is hitherto unexplored. To address this open question, we manufactured hydrogels of varying physiologically relevant stiffness and seeded human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) on them. We then infected HMEC-1 with the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and found that adhesion of Lm to host cells increases monotonically with increasing matrix stiffness, an effect that requires the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified cell surface vimentin as a candidate surface receptor mediating stiffness-dependent adhesion of Lm to HMEC-1 and found that bacterial infection of these host cells is decreased when the amount of surface vimentin is reduced.

The results demonstrated that emodin evidently inhibited HepaRG cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner by blocking cell cycle progression in the S and G2/M phase and by inducing apoptosis. Emodin treatment also resulted in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which abrogated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The above effects were all suppressed by antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Further studies by western blot analysis howed that emodin upregulated p53, p21, Bax, cyclin E, cleaved caspase-3, 8 and 9, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP).

Recent studies have shown that hypercapnia adversely affects innate immunity, host defense, lung edema clearance and cell proliferation. Airway epithelial dysfunction is a feature of advanced lung disease, but the effect of hypercapnia on airway epithelium is unknown. Thus, in the current study we examined the effect of normoxic hypercapnia (20% CO(2) for 24 h) vs normocapnia (5% CO(2)), on global gene expression in differentiated normal human airway epithelial cells. Gene expression was assessed on Affymetrix microarrays, and subjected to gene ontology analysis for biological process and cluster-network representation. We found that hypercapnia downregulated the expression of 183 genes and upregulated 126. Among these, major gene clusters linked to immune responses and nucleosome assembly were largely downregulated, while lipid metabolism genes were largely upregulated. The overwhelming majority of these genes were not previously known to be regulated by CO(2). These changes in gene expression indicate the potential for hypercapnia to impact bronchial epithelial cell function in ways that may contribute to poor clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute or advanced chronic lung diseases.","publish_time":"2018-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Casalino-Matsuda, S.

We undertook a 13-year retrospective multicenter study in 35 French ICUs in order to describe the clinical presentation and the outcome of patients admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure (ARF) revealing AS or aMDA-5 syndromes. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2017, 47 patients (23 males; median age 60 [1st\u20133rd quartiles 52\u201369] years, no comorbidity 85%) were admitted to the ICU for ARF revealing AS (n = 28, 60%) or aMDA-5 (n = 19, 40%) syndromes. Muscular, articular and cutaneous manifestations occurred in 11 patients (23%), 14 (30%) and 20 (43%) patients, respectively. Seventeen of them (36%) had no extra-pulmonary manifestations. C-reactive protein was increased (139 [40\u2013208] mg/L), whereas procalcitonine was not (0.30 [0.12\u20130.56] ng/mL). Proportion of patients with creatine kinase \u2265 2N was 20% (n = 9/47). Forty-two patients (89%) had ARDS, which was severe in 86%, with a rate of 17% (n = 8/47) of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation requirement. Proportion of patients who received corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulins and plasma exchange were 100%, 72%, 15%, 21% and 17%, respectively.

Prone positioning with longer duration and lung-protective strategies might reduce the mortality level in ARDS. The aim of this study is to investigate the survival predictors of prone positioning in patients with ARDS caused by influenza pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted by eight tertiary referral centers in Taiwan. From January 1 to March 31 in 2016, all of the patients in intensive care units with virology-proven influenza pneumonia were collected, while all of those patients with ARDS and receiving prone positioning were enrolled. Demographic data, laboratory examinations, management records, ventilator settings and clinical outcomes were collected for analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 336 patients with severe influenza pneumonia were screened and 263 patients met the diagnosis of ARDS. Totally, 65 patients receiving prone positioning were included for analysis. The 60-day survivors had lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, pneumonia severity index (PSI), creatinine level and lower rate of receiving renal replacement therapy than non-survivors (22.4 \u00B1 8.5 vs. 29.2 \u00B1 7.4, p = 0.003; 106.6 \u00B1 40.9 vs. 135.3 \u00B1 48.6, p = 0.019; 1.2 \u00B1 0.9 mg/dL vs. 3.1 \u00B1 3.6 mg/dL, p = 0.040; and 4% vs. 42%, p \u003C 0.005). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified PSI (hazard ratio 1.020, 95% confidence interval 1.009\u20131.032; p \u003C 0.001), renal replacement therapy (hazard ratio 6.248, 95% confidence interval 2.245\u201317.389; p \u003C 0.001), and increase in dynamic driving pressure (hazard ratio 1.372, 95% confidence interval 1.095\u20131.718; p = 0.006) which were independent predictors associated with 60-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, in evaluating the effect of prone positioning in patients with influenza pneumonia-related ARDS, pneumonia severity index, renal replacement therapy and increase in dynamic driving pressure were associated with 60-day mortality in patients with influenza pneumonia-related ARDS receiving prone positioning.

In this study, we observed that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection significantly triggered EGR1 expression. Overexpression of EGR1 suppressed FMDV replication in porcine cells, and knockdown of EGR1 considerably promoted FMDV replication. A previously reported FMDV mutant virus (with two amino acids mutations in SAP domain) that displays a strong type I interferon (IFN) induction activity was used in this study. We found that SAP mutant FMDV infection induced a higher expression of EGR1 than wildtype FMDV infection, and also triggered higher IFN-\u03B2 and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression than wildtype FMDV infection. This implied a link between EGR1 and type I IFN signaling. Further study showed that overexpression of EGR1 resulted in Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and NF-\u03BAB promoter activation. In addition, the SeV-induced ISGs expression was impaired in EGR1 knockdown cells. EGR1 upregulation promoted type I IFN signaling activation and suppressed FMDV and Seneca Valley virus replication. Suppression of the transcriptional activity of EGR1 did not affect its antiviral effect against FMDV.

NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient\u2019s progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide Ethanolamine (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.","publish_time":"2018-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhagat, Hiral A.; Compton, Sarah A.; Musso, David L.; Laudeman, Christopher P.; Jackson, Kimberly M.

In this respect, infectious clones constitute excellent tools to accomplish these goals. However, flavivirus infectious clones are often difficult to work with due to the toxicity of some flavivirus sequences in bacteria. To bypass this problem, several alternative approaches have been applied for the generation of ZIKV clones including, among others, in vitro ligation, insertions of introns and using infectious subgenomic amplicons. Here, we report a simple and novel DNA-launched approach based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate a cDNA clone of Rio Grande do Norte Natal ZIKV strain. The sequence was identified from the brain tissue of an aborted fetus with microcephaly. The BAC clone was fully stable in bacteria and the infectious virus was efficiently recovered in Vero cells through direct delivery of the cDNA clone. The rescued virus yielded high titers in Vero cells and was pathogenic in a validated mouse model (A129 mice) of ZIKV infection. Furthermore, using this infectious clone we have generated a mutant ZIKV containing a single amino acid substitution (A175V) in the NS2A protein that presented reduced viral RNA synthesis in cell cultures, was highly attenuated in vivo and induced fully protection against a lethal challenge with ZIKV wild-type. This BAC approach provides a stable and reliable reverse genetic system for ZIKV that will help to identify viral determinants of virulence and facilitate the development of vaccine and therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2018-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00E1rquez-Jurado, Silvia; Nogales, Aitor; \u00C1vila-P\u00E9rez, Gin\u00E9s; Iborra, Francisco J.; Mart\u00EDnez-Sobrido, Luis; Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77b07d4814698f7531468fc1bef3251088beca64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6212934.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212934/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","BAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutant ZIKV","ZIKV disease","ZIKV infection","generation of ZIKV clones","infectious virus","BAC clone","ZIKV wild-type","flavivirus infectious clones","Norte Natal ZIKV strain","BAC approach","infectious subgenomic amplicons","Vero cells","rescued virus","cDNA clone of Rio Grande","recent outbreaks of Zika virus","flavivirus sequences","viral determinants of virulence","reduced viral RNA synthesis","A175V","cell cultures","NS2A protein","Guillain","A129 mice","single amino acid substitution","validated mouse model","reliable reverse genetic system","fetal abnormalities","high titers","antivirals","Barr\u00E9 syndrome","lethal challenge","excellent tools","association","direct delivery","importance of developing countermeasures","brain tissue","development of vaccine","insertions of introns","lack of approved vaccines","aborted fetus","bacterial artificial chromosome","protection","respect","therapeutic strategies","microcephaly","novel DNA","toxicity","alternative approaches","problem","ligation","goals"],"language":"en"},

Being transmitted by Phlebotomus sandflies, SFSV causes a self-limiting, acute, often incapacitating febrile disease (\u201Csandfly fever,\u201D \u201CPappataci fever,\u201D or \u201Cdog disease\u201D) that has been known since at least the beginning of the 20th century. We show that, similarly to other pathogenic phleboviruses, SFSV suppresses the induction of the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) system in an NSs-dependent manner. SFSV NSs interfered with the TBK1-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) branch of the RIG-I signaling pathway but not with NF-\u03BAB activation. Consistently, we identified IRF3 as a host interactor of SFSV NSs. In contrast to IRF3, neither the IFN master regulator IRF7 nor any of the related transcription factors IRF2, IRF5, and IRF9 were bound by SFSV NSs. In spite of this specificity for IRF3, NSs did not inhibit its phosphorylation, dimerization, or nuclear accumulation, and the interaction was independent of the IRF3 activation or multimerization state. In further studies, we identified the DNA-binding domain of IRF3 (amino acids 1 to 113) as sufficient for NSs binding and found that SFSV NSs prevented the association of activated IRF3 with the IFN-\u03B2 promoter. Thus, unlike highly virulent phleboviruses, which either destroy antiviral host factors or sequester whole signaling chains into inactive aggregates, SFSV modulates type I IFN induction by directly masking the DNA-binding domain of IRF3. IMPORTANCE Phleboviruses are receiving increased attention due to the constant discovery of new species and the ongoing spread of long-known members of the genus. Outbreaks of sandfly fever were reported in the 19th century, during World War I, and during World War II. Currently, SFSV is recognized as one of the most widespread phleboviruses, exhibiting high seroprevalence rates in humans and domestic animals and causing a self-limiting but incapacitating disease predominantly in immunologically naive troops and travelers. We show how the nonstructural NSs protein of SFSV counteracts the upregulation of the antiviral interferon (IFN) system. SFSV NSs specifically inhibits promoter binding by IFN transcription factor 3 (IRF3), a molecular strategy which is unique among phleboviruses and, to our knowledge, among human pathogenic RNA viruses in general. This IRF3-specific and stoichiometric mechanism, greatly distinct from the ones exhibited by the highly virulent phleboviruses, correlates with the intermediate level of pathogenicity of SFSV.","publish_time":"2018-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wuerth, Jennifer Deborah; Habjan, Matthias; Wulle, Julia; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Pichlmair, Andreas; Weber, Friedemann","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d39a4fdb4c67a86c47496bef56c34f732817b4bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6232482.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6232482/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NSs binding","IRF3 activation","host interactor of SFSV NSs","nonstructural NSs protein of SFSV","IRF3-specific","DNA-binding domain of IRF3","IFN induction","association of activated IRF3","pathogenic phleboviruses","widespread phleboviruses","virulent phleboviruses","NSs-dependent manner","IMPORTANCE Phleboviruses","IFN transcription factor","IFN-\u03B2 promoter","antiviral interferon","promoter binding","Outbreaks of sandfly fever","antiviral type","Pappataci fever","incapacitating disease","identified members","antiviral host factors","IFN master regulator IRF7","Sandfly fever Sicilian virus","system","febrile disease","dog disease","World War","century","TBK1-interferon regulatory factor","related transcription factors IRF2","infecting humans","genus Phlebovirus","NF-\u03BAB activation","human pathogenic RNA viruses","order Bunyavirales","high seroprevalence rates","family Phenuiviridae","domestic animals","upregulation","constant discovery of new species","IRF5","increased attention","knowledge","correlates","interaction","intermediate level of pathogenicity","chains","IRF9","nuclear accumulation","ongoing spread","stoichiometric mechanism","inactive aggregates","amino acids","naive troops","phosphorylation","ones","branch","molecular strategy","multimerization state","pathway","dimerization","RIG","Phlebotomus sandflies","specificity","travelers","spite","contrast","beginning","studies"],"language":"en"},

Depleting cells of beclin 1, autophagy-related protein 7, or microtubule-associated protein 1A/B light chain 3B (LC3B) abolished EBOV uptake, owing to a block in vesicle formation at the cell surface.

The development of drug-resistant TB during the treatment increases the treatment complexity, and the long-term pulmonary complications after completing treatment raise the epidemic health burden. This study intended to investigate the utilization of Chinese medicine (CM) for respiratory symptoms by patients with a medical history of TB in Taiwan. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of one million individuals who were randomly selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The inclusion criteria of patients (n = 7905) with history of TB (ICD-9-CM codes 010\u2013018 and A02) were: (1) TB diagnosed between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2010 (2) 18 years old or over (3) Clinical records for at least 2 months with complete demographic information (4) Record of treatment with first-line TB medication prescriptions. CM users for conditions other than respiratory discomforts (n = 3980) were excluded. Finally, a total of 3925 TB patients were categorized as: CM users for respiratory discomforts (n = 2051) and non-CM users (n = 1874). RESULTS: Among the 3925 subjects, 2051 (52.25%) were CM users, and 1874 (44.753%) were non-CM users. Female patients and those who were younger (18\u201339 y/o) and who lived in urbanized areas relatively tended to be CM users (p \u003C .0001). Most of the CM users (1944, 94.78%) received Chinese medicines. The most commonly prescribed herbal formulas and single herbs were Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang and Radix Platycodonis (Jie-Geng), respectively. The core pattern of Chinese medicines for TB patients consisted of Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang, Bulbus Fritillariae Thunbergii (Bei-Mu), Radix Platycodonis (Jie-Geng) and Semen Armeniacae (Xing-Ren). CONCLUSIONS: The use of CM is popular among patients with a medical history of TB complicated with long-term respiratory discomforts in Taiwan.

Both steroid and immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil, have been reported to be effective in some studies, but with many side effects, especially in patients of advanced age. CASE SUMMARY: We herein report an 81-year-old female patient who was admitted to our hospital due to dry cough, and breathlessness for 1 mo. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and anti-fungal therapy, but without improvement in both symptoms and radiological findings, and her respiratory status worsened, and she required bed rest almost the whole day.

In particular, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has spread across Asia, Africa, and Europe, leading to the deaths of millions of poultry and hundreds of people. The two main means of international spread are through migratory birds and the live poultry trade. We focus on the role played by the live poultry trade in the spread of H5N1 across three regions widely infected by the disease, which also correspond to three major trade blocs: the European Union (EU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

For the EU and ASEAN, intra-bloc live poultry imports were risk reducing while extra-bloc imports were risk increasing; for ECOWAS the reverse was true. This is likely due to the fact that while the EU and ASEAN have long-standing biosecurity standards and stringent enforcement (pursuant to the World Trade Organization\u2019s Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), ECOWAS suffered from a lack of uniform standards and lax enforcement.","publish_time":"2018-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Tong; Perrings, Charles","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/942927cb4b4bfafb43d4dd87ca9b3fda5d661d60.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6300203.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6300203/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU","the Economic Community of West African States","ASEAN","Association of Southeast Asian Nations","ECOWAS"],"locations":["Asia","Africa","Europe"],"keyphrases":["risk","live poultry trade","ASEAN","ECOWAS","general biosecurity","spread of H5N1","intra-bloc live poultry imports","long-standing biosecurity standards","major trade blocs","World Trade Organization\u2019s Agreement","main means of international spread","extra-bloc imports","increasing international threat","specific biosecurity measure","all-regions level","stringent enforcement","avian influenzas","pathogenic avian influenza H5N1","lax enforcement","general surveillance","lack of uniform standards","Application of Sanitary","migratory birds","modernization","European Union","Economic Community of West African States","proxy","livestock health","Association of Southeast Asian Nations","Phytosanitary Measures","deaths of millions","value","capita GDP","hundreds of people","important inter-regional differences","decades","fact","reverse","role","disease"],"language":"en"},

There has been slow but incremental progress in identification of biomarkers that contribute to the pathophysiology of ARDS, have utility in diagnosis and monitoring, and that are potential therapeutic targets (Calfee CS, Delucchi K, Parsons PE, Thompson BT, Ware LB, Matthay MA, Thompson T, Ware LB, Matthay MA, Lancet Respir Med 2014, 2:611\u2013-620). However, a major issue is that ARDS is such a heterogeneous, multi-factorial, end-stage condition that the strategies for \u201Clumping and splitting\u201D are critical (Prescott HC, Calfee CS, Thompson BT, Angus DC, Liu VX, Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2016, 194:147\u2013-155). Nevertheless, sequencing of the human genome, the availability of improved methods for analysis of transcription to mRNA (gene expression), and development of sensitive immunoassays has allowed the application of network biology to ARDS, with these biomarkers offering potential for personalised or precision medicine (Sweeney TE, Khatri P, Toward precision medicine Crit Care Med; 2017 45:934-939). Biomarker panels have potential applications in molecular phenotyping for identifying patients at risk of developing ARDS, diagnosis of ARDS, risk stratification and monitoring. Two subphenotypes of ARDS have been identified on the basis of blood biomarkers: hypo-inflammatory and hyper-inflammatory. The hyper-inflammatory subphenotype is associated with shock, metabolic acidosis and worst clinical outcomes. Biomarkers of particular interest have included interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8), interferon gamma (IFN-\u03B3), surfactant proteins (SPD and SPB), von Willebrand factor antigen, angiopoietin 1/2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In terms of gene expression (mRNA) in blood there have been found to be increases in neutrophil-related genes in sepsis-induced and influenza-induced ARDS, but whole blood expression does not give a robust diagnostic test for ARDS. Despite improvements in management of ARDS on the critical care unit, this complex disease continues to be a major life-threatening event. Clinical trials of \u03B2(2)-agonists, statins, surfactants and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) have been disappointing. In addition, monoclonal antibodies (anti-TNF) and TNFR fusion protein have also been unconvincing. However, there have been major advances in methods of mechanical ventilation, a neuromuscular blocker (cisatracurium besilate) has shown some benefit, and stem cell therapy is being developed. In the future, by understanding the role of biomarkers in the pathophysiology of ARDS and lung injury, it is hoped that this will provide rational therapeutic targets and ultimately improve clinical care (Seymour CW, Gomez H, Chang CH, Clermont G, Kellum JA, Kennedy J, Yende S, Angus DC, Crit Care 2017, 21:257).","publish_time":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spadaro, Savino; Park, Mirae; Turrini, Cecilia; Tunstall, Tanushree; Thwaites, Ryan; Mauri, Tommaso; Ragazzi, Riccardo; Ruggeri, Paolo; Hansel, Trevor T.; Caramori, Gaetano; Volta, Carlo Alberto","journal":"J Inflamm (Lond)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2b2602266cd735aae693b599f4c7591b3a8be27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6332898.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6332898/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Liu VX","J Respir","Sweeney","Gomez","Chang CH","Kennedy"],"organizations":["ARDS","Lancet Respir","Crit Care","Crit Care Med","TNFR","Clermont G, Kellum JA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of ARDS","pathophysiology of ARDS","management of ARDS","subphenotypes of ARDS","risk of developing ARDS","influenza-induced ARDS","clinical care","critical care unit","precision medicine Crit Care Med","J Respir Crit Care Med","blood expression","identification of biomarkers","basis of blood biomarkers","role of biomarkers","Biomarkers of particular","Thompson BT","potential therapeutic targets","Calfee CS","Ware","Angus DC","Thompson T","Matthay MA","potential applications","mRNA","Lancet Respir Med","terms of gene expression","hypo-inflammatory","patients","hyper-inflammatory subphenotype","major advances","monitoring","Acute lung injury","major issue","worst clinical outcomes","rational therapeutic targets","Clinical trials of \u03B2","major life-threatening event","Kennedy J","risk stratification","methods of mechanical ventilation","keratinocyte growth factor","Willebrand factor antigen","availability of improved methods","severe form of ALI","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Chang CH","Clermont G","Kellum JA","Gomez H","Yende S","Khatri P","Liu VX","anti-TNF","shock","Delucchi","Sweeney TE","molecular phenotyping","Seymour CW","Parsons PE","surfactants","SPB","angiopoietin","analysis of transcription","IFN-\u03B3","neuromuscular blocker","multi-factorial","metabolic acidosis","end-stage condition","TNFR fusion protein","complex disease","Prescott HC","benefit","surfactant proteins","SPD","plasminogen activator inhibitor","sepsis","KGF","statins","cisatracurium besilate","monoclonal antibodies","human genome","Biomarker panels","application of network biology","agonists","addition","interferon gamma","development of sensitive immunoassays","incremental progress","interleukins","robust diagnostic test","utility","mortality rate","neutrophil-related genes","stem cell therapy","PAI","strategies","region","sequencing","improvements","future"],"language":"en"},

Clinical information and RNA-seq gene expression data were collected for 932 glioma samples from the CGGA and TCGA databases, and differentially expressed genes in both lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) samples were identified according to IDH mutation status. Only one gene, interferon-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 (ISG20), with reduced expression in IDH mutant tumors, demonstrated significant prognostic value. ISG20 expression level significantly increased with increasing tumor grade, and its high expression was associated with a poor clinical outcome. Moreover, increased ISG20 expression was associated with increased infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils, and suppressed adaptive immune response. ISG20 expression was also positively correlated with PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 expression, along with the levels of several chemokines.

Using Bacillus anthracis edema toxin (EdTx) as an adjuvant, we previously showed that innate responses triggered after sublingual immunization could limit generation of IgA responses. We tested whether co-administration of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor (NEI) could rescue the ability of EdTx to induce broad antibody responses, including mucosal IgA. NEI supplementation of sublingual vaccines containing EdTx promoted antigen-specific serum IgA responses but also enhanced serum IgG1, and IgG2b responses. This enhancing effect of NEI did not extend to all antibody isotypes and IgG sublclasses, since NEI reduced serum IgE responses and did not affect IgG2a/c and IgG3 responses. NEI supplementation also promoted anti-Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) neutralizing antibodies and enhanced high affinity IgG1 and IgA antibodies. In addition to serum IgA, NEI supplementation stimulated antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses in the GI tract, and enhanced antigen-specific IgG responses in vaginal washes. Analysis of CD4(\u002B) T helper cell responses revealed that co-administration of NEI broadened the profile of cytokine responses, by stimulating Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tfh cytokines. We also noted that NEI had a higher stimulatory effect on IL-5, IL-10, IL-17 responses.","publish_time":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rowe, John C.; Attia, Zayed; Kim, Eunsoo; Cormet-Boyaka, Estelle; Boyaka, Prosper N.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d2f0e8c7dd69338395c49a3e3aab7c4239766c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6346055.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6346055/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NEI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["generation of IgA responses","innate responses","IgG3 responses","IgG2b responses","antigen-specific serum IgA responses","induction of mucosal IgA responses","serum IgE responses","broad antibody responses","NEI supplementation stimulated antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses","enhanced antigen-specific IgG responses","profile of cytokine responses","effect of NEI","IgA antibodies","co-administration of NEI","T helper cell responses","NEI supplementation of sublingual vaccines","serum IgG1","Sublingual immunization","anti-Bacillus anthracis protective antigen","ability of EdTx","nasal immunization","IgG sublclasses","Bacillus anthracis edema toxin","antibody isotypes","high affinity IgG1","higher stimulatory effect","PA","GI tract","Th2","neutrophil elastase inhibitor","alternative","IgG2a","vaginal washes","Th17","addition","Tfh cytokines","Analysis of CD4","adjuvant"],"language":"en"},

A major reason for its continued dominance is its existence as many serotypes, determined by the surface spike protein (S), cross-protection being poor. Although controlled to some degree by live and inactivated vaccines, a new generation of IB vaccines is called for. Reverse genetic or \u2018infectious clone\u2019 systems, which allow the manipulation of the IBV genome, are key to this development. New vaccines would ideally be: genetically stable (i.e. maintain a stable attenuated phenotype); administered in ovo; and be flexible with respect to the source of the spike protein gene. Rational attenuation of IBV requires the identification of genes that are simultaneously not essential for replication and whose absence would reduce pathogenicity. Being able to modify a \u2018core\u2019 vaccine strain to make it applicable to a prevailing serotype requires a procedure for doing so, and the demonstration that \u2018spike-swapping\u2019 is sufficient to induce good immunity. We have demonstrated that four small IBV proteins, encoded by genes 3 and 5, are not essential for replication; failure to produce these proteins had little detrimental affect on the titre of virus produced. Our current molecularly cloned IBV, strain Beaudette, is non-pathogenic, so we do not know what effect the absence of these proteins would have on pathogenicity. That said, plaque size and composition of various gene 3/5 recombinant IBVs in cell culture, and reduced output and ciliostasis in tracheal organ cultures, shows that they are less aggressive than the wild-type Beaudette. Consequently these genes remain targets for rational attenuation. We have recently obtained evidence that one or more of the 15 proteins encoded by gene 1 are also determinants of pathogenicity. Hence gene 1 is also a target for rational attenuation. Replacing the S protein gene of Beaudette with that from the pathogenic M41 strain resulted in a recombinant virus that was still non-pathogenic but which did induce protection against challenge with M41. We have since made other \u2018spike-swapped\u2019 recombinants, including ones with chimaera S genes. Uniquely, our molecular clone of Beaudette is benign when administered to 18-day-old embryos, even at high doses, and induces immunity after this route of vaccination. Taken together, our results point to the creation of a new generation of IB vaccines, based on rational modification of the genome, as being a realisable objective.","publish_time":"2007-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cavanagh, Dave; Casais, Rosa; Armesto, Maria; Hodgson, Teri; Izadkhasti, Sousan; Davies, Marc; Lin, Fengsheng; Tarpey, Ian; Britton, Paul","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddfd2a01cc8bad81f00abe266c74159f5f2efd9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115386.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X07002228; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X07002228","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IB","IBV","Beaudette"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spike protein gene","Rational attenuation of IBV","S protein gene of Beaudette","IBV genome","strain Beaudette","New vaccines","small IBV proteins","cloned IBV","new generation of IB vaccines","chimaera S genes","surface spike protein","infectious clone","inactivated vaccines","rational modification","identification of genes","composition of various gene","molecular clone of Beaudette","recombinant virus","pathogenic M41 strain","vaccine strain","wild-type Beaudette","replication","absence","determinants of pathogenicity","recombinant IBVs","Abstract Infectious bronchitis coronavirus","titre of virus","cross-protection","good immunity","costly infectious disease of domestic fowl","stable attenuated phenotype","reduced output","cell culture","ciliostasis","little detrimental affect","source","tracheal organ cultures","continued dominance","ovo","high doses","serotypes","respect","cause","plaque size","systems","recombinants","ones","creation","failure","day-old embryos","countries","developed poultry industry","prevailing serotype","major reason","existence","UK","core","key","manipulation","targets","procedure","route of vaccination","realisable objective","development","degree","challenge","results","demonstration","evidence"],"language":"en"},

We assessed the effects of adoptive transfer of MSCs in acid aspiration acute lung injury and explored the role of long pentraxin PTX3. METHODS: We conducted a prospective experimental interventional study on wild-type (WT) and PTX3-deficient (PTX3(\u2212/\u2212)) mice. Acute lung injury was induced in WT and PTX3(\u2212/\u2212) mice by instillation of hydrochloric acid into the right bronchus. One hour later, animals received intraperitoneal sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), WT-MSCs (1 \u00D7 10(6)) or PTX3(\u2212/\u2212)-MSCs (1 \u00D7 10(6)). Twenty-four hours after injury, we measured the effects of treatments on arterial blood gases, wet/dry lung weight (W/D), CT scan analysis of lung collapse, neutrophils, TNF\u03B1 and CXCL1 in bronchoalveolar lavage, and plasma PTX3. d-dimer was assayed in 1 week and OH-proline in 2 weeks to track the fibrotic evolution. RESULTS: In 24 h, in comparison to PBS, WT-MSCs improved oxygenation and reduced W/D and alveolar collapse. These effects were associated with decreased concentrations of alveolar neutrophils and cytokines. WT-MSCs increased d-dimer concentration and decreased OH-proline levels, too. Treatment with PTX3(\u2212/\u2212)-MSCs ameliorated oxygenation, W/D, and alveolar TNF\u03B1, though to a lesser extent than WT-MSCs. PTX3(\u2212/\u2212)-MSCs did not improve lung collapse, neutrophil count, CXCL1, d-dimer, and OH-proline concentrations. The protective effects of WT-MSCs were dampened by lack of endogenous PTX3, too. CONCLUSIONS: In acid aspiration acute lung injury, MSCs improve pulmonary function and limit fibrosis by fine-tuning inflammation. The role of PTX3 in determining MSCs\u2019 effects might merit further scrutiny.

The IVS travelers, together with the packaged travelers who visited Hong Kong by joining packaged tours, are presently forming the largest segment of inbound travelers to Hong Kong. Despite the significant economic contributions of Chinese travelers to Hong Kong in general, and to the foodservice sector in particular, there has been an absence of prior studies on IVS travelers\u2019 behavior of selecting restaurants in the existing hospitality and tourism literature. This paper reports on an exploratory study that investigated the perceived importance of attributes that pertain to the selection of restaurants from the perspective of IVS and packaged travelers from Mainland China. Empirical findings of a questionnaire survey with 230 Chinese travelers, including 127 IVS travelers and 103 packaged travelers, showed that the respondents in general viewed the included attributes as relatively important. In addition, only two attributes exhibited significant differences between IVS and packaged travelers.

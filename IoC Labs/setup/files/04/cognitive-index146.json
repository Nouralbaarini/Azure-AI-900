The procedure was performed with percutaneous (10 cases) and open (22 cases) surgical techniques. Neither procedure-related complications nor viral transmission to health care workers was observed. Our preliminary experience supports the safety of tracheostomy, provided that appropriate protocols are strictly followed. The postoperative care is still debated, and, prudentially, our protocol includes tracheal tube change not before 2 weeks after tracheostomy, with cuff deflation and decannulation deferred until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. This is the first case series to report on such a rapidly evolving issue and might represent a source of information for clinicians worldwide who will soon be facing the same challenges.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turri-Zanoni, Mario; Battaglia, Paolo; Czaczkes, Camilla; Pelosi, Paolo; Castelnuovo, Paolo; Cabrini, Luca","journal":"Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820928963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396455/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases","COVID","postoperative care","preliminary case series","days","intensive care units","health care workers","safety of tracheostomy","preliminary experience","unprecedented number of patients","procedure-related complications","viral transmission","decannulation","overwhelming need","mean intubation period","confirmation of negative SARS-CoV","weeks","elective tracheostomies","cuff deflation","range","test results","mechanical ventilation","source of information","tracheal tube","surgical techniques","outbreak poses","appropriate protocols","evolving issue","clinicians","challenges"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the study was to evaluate ILI national sentinel criteria and viral etiologies in adults diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or ILI from 2001 to 2003 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were observed from 420 adults and collected on a daily basis from outpatient care units at University Hospital. The ILI definition included: fever plus at least one respiratory symptom (cough and/or sore throat) and one constitutional symptom (headache, malaise, myalgia, sweat or chills, or fatigue). DFA and RT\u2010PCR for influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were performed on nasal washes and 61.8% resulted positive. The respiratory viruses detected most often were influenza and rhinovirus.

Postobstructive community-acquired pneumonia (PO-CAP) is relatively common in clinical practice. The clinical syndrome is poorly defined, and the role of infection as a cause of the infiltrate is uncertain. We prospectively studied patients with PO-CAP and compared them to a cohort of patients with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (B-CAP). Methods. We prospectively studied patients hospitalized for CAP; 5.4% had PO-CAP, defined as a pulmonary infiltrate occurring distal to an obstructed bronchus. Sputum and blood cultures, viral polymerase chain reaction, urinary antigen tests, and serum procalcitonin (PCT) were done in nearly all cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with PO-CAP were compared to those of patients with B-CAP. Results. In a 2-year period, we identified 30 patients with PO-CAP. Compared to patients with B-CAP, patients with PO-CAP had longer duration of symptoms (median, 14 vs 5 days; P \u003C .001). Weight loss and cavitary lesions were more common (P \u003C .01 for both comparisons) and leukocytosis was less common (P \u003C .01) in patients with PO-CAP. A bacterial pathogen was implicated in only 3 (10%) PO-CAP cases. PCT was \u003C0.25 ng/mL in 19 (63.3%) patients. Although no differences were observed in disease severity or rates of intensive care unit admissions, 30-day mortality was significantly higher in PO-CAP vs B-CAP (40.0% vs 11.7%; P \u003C .01). Conclusions. Although there is substantial overlap, PO-CAP is a clinical entity distinct from B-CAP; a bacterial cause was identified in only 10% of patients. Our study has important implications for the clinical recognition of patients with PO-CAP, the role of microorganisms as etiologic agents, and the use of antibiotic therapy.","publish_time":"2016-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abers, Michael S.; Sandvall, Barcleigh P.; Sampath, Rahul; Zuno, Carlo; Uy, Natalie; Yu, Victor L.; Stager, Charles E.; Musher, Daniel M.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8f8dcdd44d9d40741f44f1bca45ecb6fc749976.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4803103.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/62/8/957/7450585/civ1212.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26908806/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ1212","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PO-CAP vs B-CAP","PO-CAP cases","cohort of patients","clinical recognition of patients","laboratory characteristics of patients","clinical syndrome","clinical practice","bacterial community","bacterial cause","clinical entity distinct","pneumonia","bacterial pathogen","PCT","pulmonary infiltrate","role of infection","role of microorganisms","Postobstructive community","viral polymerase chain reaction","urinary antigen tests","rates of intensive care unit admissions","blood cultures","disease severity","day mortality","serum procalcitonin","cavitary lesions","etiologic agents","important implications","Sputum","median","duration of symptoms","Weight loss","obstructed bronchus","use of antibiotic therapy","study","comparisons","leukocytosis","days","substantial overlap","differences","year period","Results","ng","Background","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCES: A search for eligible studies was conducted in three electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase up to August 10, 2018, using the following keywords: \u201Costeonecrosis\u201D, \u201Cprognosis\u201D, and \u201Ctreatment\u201D. STUDY SELECTION: Investigations appraising the clinical signs, symptoms, and imaging manifestations in different stages of ONFH were included. Articles evaluating the prognosis of various joint-preserving procedures were also reviewed. RESULTS: The pericollapse stage refers to a continuous period in the development of ONFH from the occurrence of subchondral fracture to early collapse (\u003C2 mm), possessing specific imaging features that mainly consist of bone marrow edema and joint effusion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), crescent signs on X-ray films, and clinical manifestations such as the sudden worsening of hip pain. Accumulating evidence has indicated that these findings may be secondary to the changes after subchondral fractures. Of note, computed tomography provides more information for identifying possible subchondral fractures than does MRI and serves as the most sensitive tool for grading the pericollapse lesion stage. The pericollapse stage may indicate a high possibility of progressive disease but also demonstrates satisfactory long- and medium-term outcomes for joint-preserving techniques. In fact, if the articular surface subsides more than 2 mm, total hip arthroplasty is preferable. CONCLUSIONS: The pericollapse stage with distinct clinical and imaging characteristics provides a last good opportunity for the use of joint-preserving techniques. It is necessary to separate the pericollapse stage as an independent state in evaluating the natural progression of ONFH and selecting an appropriate treatment regimen.","publish_time":"2018-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qing-Yu; Li, Zi-Rong; Gao, Fu-Qiang; Sun, Wei","journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01de46a248049d2fbdc049b686ee5b172301d0fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6213842.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30381593/; https://doi.org/10.4103/0366-6999.244111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ONFH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pericollapse stage of osteonecrosis","pericollapse lesion stage","imaging manifestations","imaging characteristics","clinical signs","clinical manifestations","joint effusion","use of joint","development of ONFH","treatment selection","prognosis of various joint","magnetic resonance imaging","MRI","specific imaging features","natural progression of ONFH","different stages of ONFH","possible subchondral fractures","techniques","occurrence of subchondral fracture","appropriate treatment regimen","crescent signs","disease diagnosis","STUDY SELECTION","total hip arthroplasty","high possibility of progressive disease","sudden worsening of hip pain","information","bone marrow edema","symptoms","electronic databases","X-ray films","eligible studies","PubMed","Cochrane Library","medium-term outcomes","Investigations","good opportunity","independent state","significance","continuous period","new definition","femoral head","findings","search","early collapse","changes","sensitive tool","DATA SOURCES","computed tomography","note","Embase","Articles","procedures","CONCLUSIONS","fact","articular surface","Accumulating evidence","OBJECTIVE","following keywords","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A rapid and accurate diagnostic method is needed for appropriate control, including isolation and treatment of the patients. Here, we report an isothermal, label-free, one-step RNA amplification and detection system, termed as iROAD, for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. It couples a one-step isothermal RNA amplification method and a bio-optical sensor for simultaneous viral RNA amplification/detection in a label-free and real-time manner. The iROAD assay offers a one-step viral RNA amplification/detection example to rapid analysis (\u003C20min). The detection limit of iROAD assay was found to be 10-times more sensitive than that of real-time reverse transcription-PCR method. We confirmed the clinical utility of the iROAD assay by detecting viral RNAs obtained from 63 human respiratory samples.

Chikungunya virus is an important human pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes that, after 60 years of exclusive circulation in Asia and Africa, has rapidly spread in Europe and the Americas. Here, we examined the evolution of CHIKV in different hosts and uncovered host-specific requirements of the CHIKV 3\u2019UTR. Sequence repeats are conserved at the CHIKV 3\u2019UTR but vary in copy number among viral lineages. We found that these blocks of repeated sequences favor RNA recombination processes through copy-choice mechanism that acts concertedly with viral selection, determining the emergence of new viral variants. Functional analyses using a panel of mutant viruses indicated that opposite selective pressures in mosquito and mammalian cells impose a fitness cost during transmission that is alleviated by recombination guided by sequence repeats. Indeed, drastic changes in the frequency of viral variants with different numbers of repeats were detected during host switch. We propose that RNA recombination accelerates CHIKV adaptability, allowing the virus to overcome genetic bottlenecks within the mosquito host. These studies highlight the role of 3\u2019UTR plasticity on CHIKV evolution, providing a new paradigm to explain the significance of sequence repetitions.","publish_time":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Filomatori, Claudia V.; Bardossy, Eugenia S.; Merwaiss, Fernando; Suzuki, Yasutsugu; Henrion, Annabelle; Saleh, Mar\u00EDa Carla; Alvarez, Diego E.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94a08b19f9910efe88ed27e54e037fb7ff986f8c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6502353.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30986247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV"],"locations":["Asia","Africa","Europe"],"keyphrases":["evolution of CHIKV","CHIKV evolution","CHIKV adaptability","Sequence repeats","mosquito host","emergence of new viral variants","viral selection","viral lineages","RNA recombination processes","frequency of viral variants","potential of RNA viruses","different numbers of repeats","new paradigm","new environments","host switch","UTR plasticity","panel of mutant viruses","significance of sequence repetitions","different hosts","uncovered host-specific requirements","copy number","Chikungunya virus","drastic changes","recent expansion of re-emergent viruses","copy-choice mechanism","mammalian cells","opposite selective pressures","important human pathogen","blocks of repeated sequences","fitness cost","Africa","Asia","years of exclusive circulation","mosquitoes","transmission","genetic bottlenecks","Functional analyses","role","Europe","genomes","Americas","studies"],"language":"en"},

As many influenza infections are subclinical, sero-surveillance is needed to allow reliable real-time estimates of infection attack rate (IAR) and severity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We tested 14,766 sera collected during the first wave of the 2009 pandemic in Hong Kong using viral microneutralization. We estimated IAR and infection-hospitalization probability (IHP) from the serial cross-sectional serologic data and hospitalization data. Had our serologic data been available weekly in real time, we would have obtained reliable IHP estimates 1 wk after, 1\u20132 wk before, and 3 wk after epidemic peak for individuals aged 5\u201314 y, 15\u201329 y, and 30\u201359 y. The ratio of IAR to pre-existing seroprevalence, which decreased with age, was a major determinant for the timeliness of reliable estimates. If we began sero-surveillance 3 wk after community transmission was confirmed, with 150, 350, and 500 specimens per week for individuals aged 5\u201314 y, 15\u201319 y, and 20\u201329 y, respectively, we would have obtained reliable IHP estimates for these age groups 4 wk before the peak. For 30\u201359 y olds, even 800 specimens per week would not have generated reliable estimates until the peak because the ratio of IAR to pre-existing seroprevalence for this age group was low. The performance of serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance substantially deteriorates if test specificity is not near 100% or pre-existing seroprevalence is not near zero. These potential limitations could be mitigated by choosing a higher titer cutoff for seropositivity. If the epidemic doubling time is longer than 6 d, then serial cross-sectional sero-surveillance with 300 specimens per week would yield reliable estimates when IAR reaches around 6%\u201310%. CONCLUSIONS: Serial cross-sectional serologic data together with clinical surveillance data can allow reliable real-time estimates of IAR and severity in an emerging pandemic.

This review describes the literature on respiratory protection against bioaerosols and identifies research gaps. Respiratory protection is a complex field involving a number of factors, such as the efficiency of respirator filter material; face-piece fitting; and maintenance, storage, and reuse of respirators. Several studies used nonpathogenic microorganisms having physical characteristics similar to that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to analyze microbial penetration through respirators. Some studies showed that high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and N95 filters provided a higher level of protection than dust/mist (DM) and dust/mist/fume (DMF) filters. Flow rate and relative humidity appear to alter the level of penetration of microorganisms through respirator filters. The relationship between microbial penetration through respirator filters and the aerodynamic diameter, length, or other physical characteristics of microorganisms remains controversial. Whether reaerosolization of bioaerosol particles should be a concern is unclear, given the fact that one study has demonstrated significant reaerosolization of 1- to 5-\u03BCm particles loaded onto respirator filters. Respirator maintenance, storage, and decontamination are important factors to be considered when reusing respirators. The respiratory protection against biologic warfare agents such as anthrax in military and civilian situations is described.","publish_time":"2004-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rengasamy, Appavoo; Zhuang, Ziqing; BerryAnn, Roland","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a42a842e5d148a178486e0bd80f90b14dfab8c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118892.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655304004481; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655304004481","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respirator filters","respiratory protection","Respirator maintenance","N95 filters","higher level of protection","level of penetration","microbial penetration","physical characteristics of microorganisms","efficiency of respirator filter material","biologic agents","storage","important factors","nonpathogenic microorganisms","dust","mist","studies","reuse of respirators","biologic warfare agents","physical characteristics similar","reaerosolization of bioaerosol particles","number of factors","research gaps","\u03BCm particles","significant reaerosolization","high-efficiency particulate air","face-piece fitting","anthrax","major concerns","HEPA","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","occupational safety","military","length","complex field","bioaerosols","aerodynamic diameter","decontamination","relative humidity","literature","fume","DMF","relationship","terrorist attack","Flow rate","civilian situations","study","review"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that a combination of inflammatory markers would differentiate between severe and mild disease in RSV-infected children. METHODS: Blood and nasopharyngeal samples from 52 RSV-infected children were collected during acute infection and after recovery. Retrospectively, patients were categorized into three groups based on disease severity: mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). Clinical data, number of flow-defined leukocyte subsets, and cytokine concentrations were compared. RESULTS: Children with severe RSV infection were characterized by young age; lymphocytopenia; increased interleukin (IL)-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and IL-6 concentrations; and decreased chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL-5) concentrations in plasma. The combination of plasma levels of IL-8 and CCL-5, and CD4(\u002B) T-cell counts, with cutoff values of 67 pg/ml, 13 ng/ml, and 2.3 \u00D7 10(6)/ml, respectively, discriminated severe from mild RSV infection with 82% sensitivity and 96% specificity. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the combination of CD4(\u002B) T-cell counts and IL-8 and CCL-5 plasma concentrations correlates with disease severity in RSV-infected children. In addition to clinical features, these immunological markers may be used to assess severity of RSV infection and guide clinical management.

This study examines how this novel disease threat was depicted in the UK newspapers, using social representations theory and in particular existing work on social representations of HIV/AIDS and Ebola to analyse the meanings of the epidemic. It investigates the way that SARS was presented as a dangerous threat to the UK public, whilst almost immediately the threat was said to be \u2018contained\u2019 using the mechanism of \u2018othering\u2019: SARS was said to be unlikely to personally affect the UK reader because the Chinese were so different to \u2018us\u2019; so \u2018other\u2019.

The spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) highlights the need for novel treatment options. Sodium new houttuyfonate (SNH) is an analogue of houttuynin, the main antibacterial ingredient of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro activity of SNH and its potential for synergy with antibiotics against hospital-associated MRSA. METHODOLOGY: A total of 103 MRSA clinical isolates recovered in two hospitals in Beijing were evaluated for susceptibility to SNH, oxacillin, cephalothin, meropenem, vancomycin, levofloxacin, minocycline, netilmicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole by broth microdilution. Ten isolates were evaluated for potential for synergy between SNH and the antibiotics above by checkerboard assay. Time-kill analysis was performed in three isolates to characterize the kill kinetics of SNH alone and in combination with the antibiotics that engendered synergy in checkerboard assays. Besides, two reference strains were included in all assays. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: SNH inhibited all test strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 16 to 64 \u00B5g/mL in susceptibility tests, and displayed inhibition to bacterial growth in concentration-dependent manner in time-kill analysis. In synergy studies, the combinations of SNH-oxacillin, SNH-cephalothin, SNH-meropenem and SNH-netilmicin showed synergistic effects against 12 MRSA strains with median fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices of 0.38, 0.38, 0.25 and 0.38 in checkerboard assays. In time-kill analysis, SNH at 1/2 MIC in combination with oxacillin at 1/128 to 1/64 MIC or netilmicin at 1/8 to 1/2 MIC decreased the viable colonies by \u22652log(10) CFU/mL. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SNH demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activity against 103 hospital-associated MRSA isolates. Combinations of sub-MIC levels of SNH and oxacillin or netilmicin significantly improved the in vitro antibacterial activity against MRSA compared with either drug alone. The SNH-based combinations showed promise in combating MRSA.","publish_time":"2013-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Xi; Yang, Xinyi; Li, Xue; Lu, Yun; Ren, Zhitao; Zhao, Longyin; Hu, Xinxin; Jiang, Jiandong; You, Xuefu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1541ead6bf6988b4d08b12873806a89a4b7ff1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3699466.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23844154/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNH","MIC"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["SNH-netilmicin","activity of SNH","combinations of SNH","SNH-meropenem","SNH-cephalothin","kill kinetics of SNH","SNH-based combinations","MRSA strains","Combinations of sub-MIC levels of SNH","oxacillin","MRSA clinical isolates","hospital-associated MRSA isolates","antibacterial activity","antibiotics","analysis","Time","checkerboard assays","synergy studies","test strains","reference strains","potential","resistant Staphylococcus aureus","median fractional inhibitory concentration","susceptibility tests","concentration-dependent manner","minimum inhibitory concentrations","main antibacterial ingredient of Houttuynia cordata Thunb","bacterial growth","displayed inhibition","vancomycin","synergistic effects","severe infections","trimethoprim","minocycline","need","levofloxacin","analogue of houttuynin","hospitals","spread of methicillin","sulfamethoxazole","indices","MICs","total","Beijing","SIGNIFICANCE","promise","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","novel treatment options","Sodium new houttuyfonate","broth microdilution","bacteremia","sepsis","viable colonies","BACKGROUND","\u00B5g","study","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","drug","aim","CFU"],"language":"en"},

AGI-10 impinger was used as the representative for all the impingers which would bubble during operation. It was found that the survival probability of the same bacteriophage bubbling with different sampling solutions was different except that there was no significant difference observed for the bacteriophage F2. The use of SM as the collection fluid was relative to a high survival probability for the four bacteriophages. And the endurance or resistance of different kinds of bacteriophages in the same sampling solution was different.

Confocal microscopy revealed translocation of AIF to the nuclei of the majority of apoptotic cells.

Objectives: Since most bronchiolitis studies fail to detect any viral pathogen in part of the samples, we sought for the presence of hMPV in a well characterized bronchiolitis cohort. Study design: Nasal washes were obtained from 56 children admitted to the hospital for acute bronchiolitis. RNA extraction and subsequent RT-PCR were used to detect hMPV, and correlated the presence of the virus with clinical characteristics of the disease. Results and conclusions: PCR revealed the presence of hMPV in 16% of bronchiolitis cases, whereas respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 67.9%) was the most frequently encountered viral pathogen. hMPV was identified either as a unique viral pathogen or co-existed with RSV, with whom they shared a similar seasonal distribution. There were no differences in disease characteristics, either clinical or laboratory, between bronchiolitis cases where hMPV was present and those caused by RSV or other viral pathogens. These findings suggest that hMPV is a common and important causative agent in infants with bronchiolitis, with clinical characteristics similar to that of RSV.","publish_time":"2004-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Psarras, Stelios; Bossios, Apostolos; Tsolia, Maria; Gourgiotis, Dimitrios; Liapi-Adamidou, Georgia; Constantopoulos, Andreas G; Kafetzis, Dimitrios; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e3cdb0d3a8af9d764e7e10352e384e43cfb07de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129958.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653204000034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653204000034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of hMPV","bronchiolitis cases","acute bronchiolitis","bronchiolitis studies","RSV","characterized bronchiolitis cohort","clinical characteristics similar","unique viral pathogen","disease characteristics","viral pathogens","children","respiratory syncytial virus","acute respiratory tract infections","subsequent RT-PCR","similar seasonal distribution","infants","laboratory","important causative agent","RTIs","Nasal washes","RNA extraction","Abstract Background","Human Metapneumovirus","Pneumovirinae subfamily","Paramyxoviridae family","Study design","conclusions","differences","hospital","samples","Results","Objectives","findings"],"language":"en"},

Lesions were more acute in the early stages of the outbreak and included perivascular pyogranulomatous inflammation with exudative serositis. Lesions occurred only in males. Vascular lesions were common in the liver of all affected wildcats, serositis occurred in the abdominal and thoracic cavities in most cases and meningeal lesions were present in two cases. Immunohistochemistry with specific antisera detected viral antigen within macrophages in all lesions. This outbreak demonstrates that the lesions of feline infectious peritonitis can become modified over time and that the virus can persist in a closed colony, possibly via carrier wildcats.","publish_time":"1993-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watt, N.

The recombinant NPs (rNPs) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-affinity column and size exclusion chromatography. Sequencing data indicated that the N genes of CCoV-BJ70 and CRCoV-BJ202 belonging to two distinctly different groups were relatively conserved within each subgroup.

These findings indicate that further serologic studies on coronavirus infections at the animal-human interface are needed.","publish_time":"2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Shuai; Chen, Yingzhu; Qin, Kun; Zhou, Jianfang; Lou, Yongliang; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"Sci China Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c62d0cda463aebc072588c4d0c51b0ba1a4a6d8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27084706/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-016-5038-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["rNPs of CCoV","CRCoV rNPs","CCoV-BJ70","rNP of CCoV","CRCoV-BJ202","N genes of CCoV","canine coronavirus","coronavirus infections","canine respiratory coronavirus","HCoV","antigenic cross-reactivity","human coronaviruses","NL63","animal-human interface","mice antisera","Escherichia coli","Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","SDS-PAGE","nickel-affinity column","China","results","HKU1","size exclusion chromatography","serologic studies","diseased pet dogs","swabs","anti-sera","OC43","Western blot analysis","antigenicity of nucleocapsid proteins","Beijing","Sequencing data","summary","different groups","final purity","findings","recombinant NPs","subgroup"],"language":"en"},

The approach led to the segregation of all segments of swine and human viruses into three distinct groups: two of them included the pandemic 1977 and 2009 human viruses, and the remaining group may be new in humans. These three groups might have originated from avian viruses and drifted out independently. Genome shifts occurred occasionally among swine viruses; however, distances between avian and swine/human viruses negated the existence of direct shifts from avian viruses. In humans, only one or two viruses appeared each year, which suggests the presence of competition among viruses that migrated freely. All segments drifted continuously under certain rules and constant velocity. Viruses that had caused an outbreak did not appear again over subsequent decades, which may mean populations had become immune to such viruses. In contrast, the viruses in livestock were rather conserved and maintained unique strains in small, separate areas. Such collections of swine strains included human segments, which could become an epidemic in the future.","publish_time":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Konishi, Tomokazu","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/275cb246ac9ec33ec4e7fa1042caab6016c0e0e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6917806.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-55254-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31848356/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human viruses","swine viruses","avian viruses","human segments","segments of swine","collections of swine strains","humans","unique strains","Genome shifts","new methodology","distinct groups","existence of direct shifts","objective method","comparisons","data","remaining group","distances","viral types","separate areas","certain rules","populations","livestock","history of influenza H1 virus","constant velocity","segregation","subsequent decades","presence of competition","epidemic","outbreak","year","contrast","pandemic","future","approach"],"language":"en"},

Based on global aviation network, we turn the problem of indirect flights into a question of second neighbors, and propose a susceptible-infectious-susceptible model to study disease transmission on a connected metapopulation network coupled with its second-neighbor network (SNN). We calculate the basic reproduction number, which is independent of human mobility, and we prove the global stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria of the model. Furthermore, the study shows that the behavior that all travelers travel along the SNN may hinder the spread of disease if the SNN is not connected. However, the behavior that individuals travel along the metapopulation network coupled with its SNN contributes to the spread of disease. Thus for an emerging infectious disease, if the real network and its SNN keep the same connectivity, indirect transportations may be a potential threat and need to be controlled. Our work can be generalized to high-speed train and rail networks, which may further promote other research on metapopulation networks.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Shanshan; Jin, Zhen","journal":"Applied Mathematics and Computation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62dd99212f67a87c0f45ee0286c9734cb6f368f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112355.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0096300319303923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287503/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2019.05.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300319303923","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SNN","connected metapopulation network","metapopulation networks","real network","spread of disease","neighbor network","emerging infectious disease","global aviation network","susceptible-infectious","study disease transmission","effect of indirect transportations","susceptible model","problem of indirect flights","rail networks","behavior","travelers travel","Abstract Traditional infectious diseases models","global stability of disease-free","endemic equilibria","high-speed train","question","independent of human mobility","basic reproduction number","neighbors","potential threat","individuals","connectivity","research"],"language":"en"},

No epidemiological research on BToV has been reported from Japan. In this study, we performed a survey to detect BToV in Japan in 2004 and 2005 using 231 fecal samples (167 from diarrheic cattle and 64 from asymptomatic cattle) that were analyzed by nested reverse transcription (RT) PCR using primers located in the consensus sequences of the reported BToV nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and spike (S) genes. BToV N, M, and S genes were detected in 6.5% (15/231), 6.1% (14/231), and 5.6% (13/231) of samples by nested-RT-PCR, respectively. In conclusion, detectability was improved compared to the results of the first round of RT-PCR. BToV was detected at a significantly higher rate in diarrheic samples than in asymptomatic samples (14/167 diarrheic samples [8.4%] and 1/64 asymptomatic samples [1.6%]), suggesting that BToV may act as a risk factor for diarrhea in Japanese cattle. The nucleotide sequence of M fragments from the BToV isolates including the newly identified Japanese isolates showed more than 97% identity. A similar degree of homology was observed in the N gene fragment among BToV isolates with the exception of BRV-1 and BRV-2. Domestic samples were classified into three clusters by phylogenetic analysis of the S gene fragment, which were considerably correlated with the geographic origin of the samples. BToV positive areas did not adjoin each other but were spread across a wide range, suggesting that BToV exists conventionally in Japan and is geographically differentiated. We also developed an RFLP method to distinguish these clusters using two restriction enzymes, HaeIII and AccI. This method should be useful for comparing newly acquired BToV-positive samples with the reported BToVs.","publish_time":"2007-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ito, Toshihiro; Okada, Nobutaka; Fukuyama, Shin-ichi","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114342.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170207000147; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170207000147","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RFLP"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["BToV-positive samples","BToV isolates","diarrheic samples","asymptomatic samples","reported BToV nucleocapsid","BToV positive areas","fecal samples","Domestic samples","diarrheic cattle","asymptomatic cattle","Japanese cattle","PCR","Japanese isolates","nested-RT","S genes","N gene fragment","S gene fragment","clusters","round of RT","reported BToVs","exception of BRV","RFLP method","nested reverse transcription","consensus sequences","established gastrointestinal infectious agent","primers","phylogenetic analysis","risk factor","Coronaviridae family","restriction enzymes","HaeIII","member","diarrhea","fragments","membrane","higher rate","Abstract Bovine torovirus","AccI","results","spike","survey","similar degree of homology","nucleotide sequence","detectability","geographic origin","epidemiological research","wide range","conclusion","study","identity"],"language":"en"},

Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats are defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi- Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis. Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination.

METHODS: We searched the Web of Science database using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) of \u201CPneumonia\u201D from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2015. The only document types we studied were original articles and reviews, analyzing descriptive indicators by five-year periods and the scientific production by country, adjusting for population, economic, and research-related parameters. RESULTS: A total of 22,694 references were retrieved. The number of publications increased steadily over time, from 981 publications in 2001 to 1977 in 2015 (R(2) = 0.956). The most productive country was the USA (38.49%), followed by the UK (7.18%) and Japan (5.46%). Research production from China increased by more than 1000%. By geographical area, North America (42.08%) and Europe (40.79%) were most dominant. Scientific production in low- and middle-income countries more than tripled, although their overall contribution to the field remained limited (\u003C 15%). Overall, 18.8% of papers were the result of an international collaboration, although this proportion was much higher in sub-Saharan Africa (46.08%) and South Asia (23.43%). According to the specific MeSH terms used, articles focused mainly on \u201CPneumonia, Bacterial\u201D (19.99%), followed by \u201CPneumonia, Pneumococcal\u201D (7.02%) and \u201CPneumonia, Ventilator-Associated\u201D (6.79%). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia research increased steadily over the 15-year study period, with Europe and North America leading scientific production. About a fifth of all papers reflected international collaborations, and these were most evident in papers from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome has shown vividly the importance of sensitive worldwide surveillance. The Agency for Cooperation in International Health, a Japanese non-governmental organisation, has developed on a voluntary basis a sentinel surveillance system for selected target infectious diseases, covering South America, Africa, and Asia. The system has uncovered unreported infectious diseases of international importance including cholera, plague, and influenza; current trends of acute flaccid paralysis surveillance in polio eradication; and prevalence of HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C in individual areas covered by the sentinels. Despite a limited geographical coverage, the system seems to supplement disease information being obtained by global surveillance. Further development of this sentinel surveillance system would be desirable to contribute to current global surveillance efforts, for which, needless to say, national surveillance and alert system takes principal responsibility.","publish_time":"2004-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arita, Isao; Nakane, Miyuki; Kojima, Kazunobu; Yoshihara, Namiko; Nakano, Takashi; El-Gohary, Ahmed","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bd5e4119209e96a49215da26b88c6683021eb8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129469.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309904009429; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309904009429","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Health"],"locations":["South America","Africa","Asia"],"keyphrases":["sentinel surveillance system","national surveillance","current global surveillance efforts","integrated global epidemiological surveillance","alert system","importance of sensitive worldwide surveillance","current trends of acute flaccid paralysis surveillance","global inequality","unreported infectious diseases of international importance","selected target infectious diseases","International Health","hepatitis B","hepatitis C","developed infrastructure","emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome","polio eradication","South America","influenza","prevalence of HIV","plague","cholera","nation states","Japanese non-governmental organisation","disinterest","syphilis","voluntary basis","individual areas","principal responsibility","Cooperation","Africa","disease information","result of political unrest","Asia","Agency","limited geographical coverage","development","sentinels","Summary"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses to IBV infection is a crucial element for further improvements in strategies to control IB. To this end, two chicken lines, selected for high (L10H line) and low (L10L line) serum concentration of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) were studied. In total, 32 birds from each line were used. Sixteen birds from each line were infected with IBV and sixteen were left uninfected. Eight uninfected and infected birds from each line were euthanized at 1 and 3 weeks post infection. RNA sequencing was performed on spleen samples from all 64 birds and differential gene expression analysis was performed for four comparisons: L10L line versus L10H line for uninfected birds at weeks 1 and 3, respectively, and in the same way for infected birds. Functional analysis was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) Immune System Process terms specific for Gallus gallus. RESULTS: Comparing uninfected L10H and L10L birds, we identified 1698 and 1424 differentially expressed (DE) genes at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. For the IBV-infected birds, 1934 and 866 DE genes were identified between the two lines at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. The two most enriched GO terms emerging from the comparison of uninfected birds between the two lines were \u201CLymphocyte activation involved in immune response\u201D and \u201CSomatic recombination of immunoglobulin genes involved in immune response\u201D at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. When comparing IBV-infected birds between the two lines, the most enriched GO terms were \u201CAlpha-beta T cell activation\u201D and \u201CPositive regulation of leukocyte activation\u201D at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy birds from the two lines showed significant differences in expression profiles for subsets of adaptive and innate immunity-related genes, whereas comparison of the IBV-infected birds from the two lines showed differences in expression of immunity-related genes involved in T cell activation and proliferation. The observed transcriptome differences between the two lines indicate that selection for MBL had influenced innate as well as adaptive immunity.

Respiratory tract infection is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization among adults, and recent evidence suggests that many of these illnesses are associated with viruses. Although bacterial infection is known to complicate viral infections, the frequency and impact of mixed viral-bacterial infections has not been well studied. Methods. Adults hospitalized with respiratory illness during 3 winters underwent comprehensive viral and bacterial testing. This assessment was augmented by measuring the serum level of procalcitonin (PCT) as a marker of bacterial infection. Mixed viral-bacterial infection was defined as a positive viral test result plus a positive bacterial assay result or a serum PCT level of \u2265 0.25 ng/mL on admission or day 2 of hospitalization. Results. Of 842 hospitalizations (771 patients) evaluated, 348 (41%) had evidence of viral infection. A total of 212 hospitalizations (61%) involved patients with viral infection alone. Of the remaining 136 hospitalizations (39%) involving viral infection, results of bacterial tests were positive in 64 (18%), and PCT analysis identified bacterial infection in an additional 72 (21%). Subjects hospitalized with mixed viral-bacterial infections were older and more commonly received a diagnosis of pneumonia. Over 90% of hospitalizations in both groups involved subjects who received antibiotics. Notably, 4 of 10 deaths among subjects hospitalized with viral infection alone were secondary to complications of Clostridium difficile colitis. Conclusions. Bacterial coinfection is associated with approximately 40% of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization. Patients with positive results of viral tests should be carefully evaluated for concomitant bacterial infection. Early empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with an unstable condition is appropriate but is not without risk.","publish_time":"2013-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Falsey, Ann R.; Becker, Kenneth L.; Swinburne, Andrew J.; Nylen, Eric S.; Formica, Maria A.; Hennessey, Patricia A.; Criddle, Mary M.; Peterson, Derick R.; Baran, Andrea; Walsh, Edward E.","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c10ed03edfb97eb2fff8b5e28f43c0c97d9a305c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3699009.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jit190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23661797/; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/208/3/432/18069883/jit190.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections","evidence of viral infection","marker of bacterial infection","concomitant bacterial infection","impact of mixed viral-bacterial infections","bacterial testing","Bacterial coinfection","positive bacterial assay","results of bacterial tests","positive results of viral tests","viral respiratory tract infections","positive viral test result","patients","hospitalizations","Subjects","serum PCT level","PCT analysis","respiratory illness","adults","serum level of procalcitonin","recent evidence","winters","Early empirical antibiotic therapy","frequency","complications of Clostridium difficile colitis","unstable condition","common reasons","admission","day","groups","deaths","illnesses","antibiotics","diagnosis of pneumonia","viruses","risk","assessment","total","Background","Methods","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The prototype compound of this family is a derivative of pentaerythritol with 12 peripheral Trp groups and trivalent spacer arms. Here a novel series of dendrimers with divalent and tetravalent branched arms, instead of the trivalent ones present on the prototype, has been synthesized and its activity against HIV, EV71 and a panel of 16 different viruses and other pathogens has been determined. Convergent or divergent approaches have been used for the synthesis of these compounds. Our findings demonstrate that only compounds with tetravalent branched arms showed the same anti-HIV and anti-EV71 activity of the prototype (low micromolar) and even gain significant antiviral activity against new pathogens such as HSV-2, adenovirus-2, human corona virus and respiratory syncytial virus, being the first members of the Trp dendrimer family that showed activity against those viruses. As the prototype, these compounds also showed low-nanomolar activity against a representative EV71 clinical isolate. Experimental work carried on to determine the mode of action of the most potent IIa, containing tetravalent branched arms, demonstrated that it interacts with the viral envelopes of HIV, EV71 and HSV-2 and thus may prevent virus attachment to the host cell. These results support the interest of this new series of Trp dendrimers and qualify them as useful prototypes for the development of novel inhibitors of viral entry with broad antiviral spectrum.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez-Gualda, Bel\u00E9n; Sun, Liang; Mart\u00ED-Mar\u00ED, Olaia; Mirabelli, Carmen; Delang, Leen; Neyts, Johan; Schols, Dominique; Camarasa, Mar\u00EDa-Jos\u00E9; San-F\u00E9lix, Ana","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02a9caf11a66858c1a691a04a8d7fac1c80db9f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114229.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228490/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.06.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354218306521; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218306521","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-EV71 activity","tetravalent branched arms","significant antiviral activity","anti-HIV","enterovirus EV71","new series of Trp dendrimers","compounds","low-nanomolar activity","new pathogens","prototype compound","trivalent spacer arms","Trp dendrimer family","novel series of dendrimers","new class of dendrimers","viral envelopes of HIV","peripheral Trp groups","representative EV71 clinical isolate","virus attachment","HSV","dual antiviral activities","human corona virus","respiratory syncytial virus","broad antiviral spectrum","low micromolar","different viruses","development of novel inhibitors of viral entry","trivalent ones present","potent IIa","derivative of pentaerythritol","residues","surface","useful prototypes","members","tryptophan","adenovirus","panel","mode of action","host cell","divergent approaches","synthesis","findings","Experimental work","results"],"language":"en"},

Many diseases caused by animal paramyxoviruses also have a neurological component or a reproductive disease component. Several of the most devastating diseases of animals, such as rinderpest, Newcastle disease, and canine distemper, are caused by paramyxoviruses. Some of the animal paramyxoviruses, such as the Hendra and Nipah viruses, are emerging zoonotic pathogens of major public health concern. New paramyxoviruses are being isolated on a continuing basis from a wide variety of animals. All animal paramyxoviruses belong to the family Paramyxoviridae. The members of this virus family are enveloped and have genomes consisting of a single segment of negative-sense RNA that contains 6\u201310 genes encoding up to 12 proteins. Although there are many animal paramyxoviruses, only a few effective vaccines are currently available. In the last decade, methods of producing many animal paramyxoviruses entirely from cDNA clones (reverse genetics) have been developed. This has not only greatly improved our understanding of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of these viruses, but has also made it possible to engineer improved vaccines for them.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Samal, S.

Purified N protein enhanced hammerhead ribozyme self-cleavage and nucleic acids annealing, which are properties that define RNA chaperones. In contrast, another RNA-binding protein, PTB, did not show these activities. N protein chaperone activity was blocked by specific monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, it was concluded that TGEV N protein is an RNA chaperone. In addition, we have shown that purified severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV N protein also has RNA chaperone activity. In silico predictions of disordered domains showed a similar pattern for all coronavirus N proteins evaluated.

These small membrane proteins assemble into oligomers that can permeabilize cellular lipid bilayers, disrupting the physiology of the host to the advantage of the virus. Consequently, efforts during the last few decades have been focused towards the discovery of viroporin channel inhibitors, but in general these have not been successful to produce licensed drugs. Viroporins are also involved in viral pathogenesis by engaging in critical interactions with viral proteins, or disrupting normal host cellular pathways through coordinated interactions with host proteins. These protein-protein interactions (PPIs) may become alternative attractive drug targets for the development of antivirals. In this sense, while thus far most antiviral molecules have targeted viral proteins, focus is moving towards targeting host proteins that are essential for virus replication. In principle, this largely would overcome the problem of resistance, with the possibility of using repositioned existing drugs. The precise role of these PPIs, their strain- and host- specificities, and the structural determination of the complexes involved, are areas that will keep the fields of virology and structural biology occupied for years to come. In the present review, we provide an update of the efforts in the characterization of the main PPIs for most viroporins, as well as the role of viroporins in these PPIs interactions.","publish_time":"2018-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"To, Janet; Torres, Jaume","journal":"Virus Protein and Nucleoprotein Complexes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81e6258bfab027095b794bbeaf024687ee771236.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122450.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-8456-0_15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900504/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host proteins","viral proteins","PPIs interactions","host- specificities","role of viroporins","protein-protein interactions","coordinated interactions","critical interactions","main PPIs","small membrane proteins","normal host cellular pathways","viral pathogenesis","efforts","structural biology","structural determination","virus replication","precise role","licensed drugs","cellular lipid bilayers","repositioned existing drugs","oligomers","alternative attractive drug targets","possibility","physiology","focus","general","discovery of viroporin channel inhibitors","development of antivirals","update","fields of virology","characterization","antiviral molecules","strain","complexes","years","short polypeptides","viruses","advantage","present review","problem of resistance","areas","decades","sense","principle"],"language":"en"},

Our previous work with SARS-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two MERS-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate infection of human gut cells, but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues replication of HKU5-CoV, a second MERS-like group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate emergence potential of CoVs and offer a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains. Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans.","publish_time":"2019-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menachery, Vineet D.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Yount, Boyd L.; McAnarney, Eileen T.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Hale, Andrew; Graham, Rachel L.; Scobey, Trevor; Anthony, Simon J.; Wang, Lingshu; Graham, Barney; Randell, Scott H.; Lipkin, W.

The prevention of YHV infection in shrimp has been developed by various methods, but it is still insufficient to protect the mass mortality in shrimp. New approaches for the antiviral drug development for viral infection have been focused on the inhibition of several potent viral enzymes, and thus the YHV protease is one of the interesting targets for developing antiviral drugs according to the pivotal roles of the enzyme in an early stage of viral propagation. In this study, a theoretical modeling of the YHV protease was constructed based on the folds of several known crystal structures of other viral proteases, and was subsequently used as a target for virtual screening\u2014molecular docking against approximately 1364 NCI structurally diversity compounds. A complex between the protease and the hit compounds was investigated for intermolecular interactions by molecular dynamics simulations. Five best predicted compounds (NSC122819, NSC345647, NSC319990, NSC50650, and NSC5069) were tested against bacterial expressed YHV. The NSC122819 showed the best inhibitory characteristic among the candidates, while others showed more than 50 % of inhibition in the assay condition.

Here, we analyse the antigenicity of PV(pv)(WT) and PV(pv) with capsid proteins of Sabin vaccine strains (PV(pv)[Sabin]) in human serum. Type 2 and 3 PV(pv)(WT) and PV(pv)(Sabin) show similar antigenicity in the analysed set of human sera in contrast to type 1 PV(pv). The levels of PV(pv)(Sabin) infection (%), including about 70% of PV(pv) infection (%) measured in the presence of human serum diluted to the cPNT titre, serve as the optimal threshold values for pPNT (5% for type 1 and 2, 10% for type 3) to show high correlation with cPNT results.

Currently, there are no FDA-licensed vaccines against arenaviruses and the only available antiviral therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin that is partially effective. Arenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) is found associated with the genomic RNA forming the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) that together with the polymerase (L) direct viral replication and transcription. Virion formation requires the recruitment of vRNPs into budding sites, a process in which the arenavirus matrix-like protein (Z) plays a major role. Therefore, proper NP-NP and NP-Z interactions are required for the generation of infectious progeny. In this work we demonstrate the role of the amino acid residue D471 in the self-association of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein (LCMV-NP). Amino acid substitutions at this position abrogate NP oligomerization, affecting its ability to mediate replication and transcription of a minigenome reporter plasmid. However, its ability to interact with the Z protein, counteract the cellular interferon response and bind to dsRNA analogs was retained. Additionally, we also document the dominant negative effect of D471G mutation on viral infection, suggesting that NP self-association is an excellent target for the development of new antivirals against arenaviruses.","publish_time":"2012-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ortiz-Ria\u00F1o, Emilio; Cheng, Benson Y.

It is increasingly important to research the effect of urbanization on CO2 emissions, especially in large emerging and developing economies, due to the indispensable need for understanding the effect of urbanization on CO2 emissions, evaluating carbon reduction tasks and providing the scientific basis for low-carbon urbanization. Utilizing a balanced panel dataset in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, during the period of 2000\u20132010, this paper employed data envelopment analysis (DEA) window analysis and a spatial lag panel Tobit model to investigate the effect of urbanization on CO2 emissions efficiency (the ratio of the target CO2 emissions to the actual CO2 emissions). The results show that the average CO2 emissions efficiency was 0.959 in 2010, and CO2 emissions efficiency ranged from 0.816 to 1 and exhibited spatial clustering in the region. The larger potential of CO2 emissions reduction appeared in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou, indicating that more CO2 emissions reduction tasks should be allocated to these two cities. Urbanization has negative effects on improving CO2 emissions efficiency, and there is a U-curve relation between CO2 emissions efficiency and urbanization, indicating that CO2 emissions efficiency decreases at the early stage of urbanization, then increases when urbanization reach a high level. There is spatial spillover effect among the prefecture-level cities, suggesting that different prefecture-level governments should coordinate with each other to improve CO2 emissions efficiency in the whole area. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita also plays a markedly positive role in improving CO2 emissions efficiency. This research highlights the effect of urbanization on CO2 emissions efficiency and the importance of improving CO2 emissions efficiency in developing countries.","publish_time":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jianbao; Huang, Xianjin; Kwan, Mei-Po; Yang, Hong; Chuai, Xiaowei","journal":"Journal of Cleaner Production","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64c9fa497c2aa4fe9d0b190a38ff707611a9b715.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127308.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.198; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652618308692; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652618308692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288345/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["the Yangtze River Delta"],"keyphrases":["target CO2 emissions","actual CO2 emissions","average CO2 emissions efficiency","CO2 emissions reduction tasks","important areas of CO2 emissions","larger potential of CO2 emissions reduction","effect of urbanization","low-carbon urbanization","early stage of urbanization","spatial spillover effect","prefecture-level cities","carbon reduction tasks","spatial clustering","high level","Abstract Cities","research","different prefecture-level governments","spatial lag panel Tobit model","window analysis","developing countries","data envelopment analysis","balanced panel dataset","DEA","Yangtze River Delta","scientific basis","ratio","importance","U-curve relation","Yangzhou","negative effects","China","economies","YRD","paper","Zhenjiang","positive role","indispensable need","Gross domestic product","GDP","results","region","period"],"language":"en"},

Pairwise comparison at both the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) levels between virulent and attenuated TGEV strains identified a common change in nt 1753 of the spike gene, resulting in a serine to alanine mutation at aa position 585 of the spike proteins of the attenuated TGEV strains. Alanine was also present in this protein in PRCV-ISU-1. Particularly noteworthy, the serine to alanine mutation resides in the region of the major antigenic site A/B (aa 506-706) that elicites neutralizing antibodies and within the domain mediating the cell surface receptor aminopeptidase N binding (aa 522-744). Comparison of the predicted polypeptide products of ORF3b showed significant deletions in the naturally attenuated PRCV ISU-1 and TGEV Miller M60; these deletions occurred at a common break point, suggesting a related mechanism of recombination that may affect viral virulence or tropism. Sequence comparisons at both genomic and protein levels indicated that PRCV-ISU-1 had a closer relationship with TGEV Miller strains than Purdue strains.

Bats, remarkably, are the natural reservoirs of many of the most pathogenic viruses in humans. There are two bat genome projects currently underway, a circumstance that promises to speed the discovery host factors important in the coevolution of bats with their viruses. These genomes, however, are not yet assembled and one of them will provide only low coverage, making the inference of most genes of immunological interest error-prone. Many more wildlife genome projects are underway and intend to provide only shallow coverage. RESULTS: We have developed a statistical method for the assembly of gene families from partial genomes. The method takes full advantage of the quality scores generated by base-calling software, incorporating them into a complete probabilistic error model, to overcome the limitation inherent in the inference of gene family members from partial sequence information. We validated the method by inferring the human IFNA genes from the genome trace archives, and used it to infer 61 type-I interferon genes, and single type-II interferon genes in the bats Pteropus vampyrus and Myotis lucifugus. We confirmed our inferences by direct cloning and sequencing of IFNA, IFNB, IFND, and IFNK in P. vampyrus, and by demonstrating transcription of some of the inferred genes by known interferon-inducing stimuli. CONCLUSION: The statistical trace assembler described here provides a reliable method for extracting information from the many available and forthcoming partial or shallow genome sequencing projects, thereby facilitating the study of a wider variety of organisms with ecological and biomedical significance to humans than would otherwise be possible.","publish_time":"2010-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kepler, Thomas B; Sample, Christopher; Hudak, Kathryn; Roach, Jeffrey; Haines, Albert; Walsh, Allyson; Ramsburg, Elizabeth A","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/924313134ea2e38b9e48ceaa1177afb92f7a5c03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3091641.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663124/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-11-444","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Myotis"],"organizations":["IFNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interferon genes","human IFNA genes","genes of immunological","inferred genes","wildlife genome projects","statistical method","shallow genome sequencing projects","bat genome projects","partial genomes","reliable method","genome trace archives","sequencing of IFNA","partial sequence information","bats Pteropus vampyrus","coevolution of bats","humans","shallow coverage","statistical trace assembler","inference of gene family members","single type","human pathogens","error-prone","pathogenic viruses","assembly of gene families","complete probabilistic error model","wider variety of organisms","IFNB","study","limitation inherent","IFND","discovery host factors important","biomedical significance","direct cloning","quality scores","rate of emergence","Myotis lucifugus","circumstance","software","base","IFNK","inferences","advantage","CONCLUSION","transcription","BACKGROUND","natural reservoirs","novel agents","stimuli","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Quantitative infection risk assessment can provide quantitative analysis of disease transmission and the effectiveness of infection control measures. The Wells\u2013Riley model has been extensively used for quantitative infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases in indoor premises. Some newer studies have also proposed the use of dose\u2010response models for such purpose. This study reviews and compares these two approaches to infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases. The Wells\u2013Riley model allows quick assessment and does not require interspecies extrapolation of infectivity. Dose\u2010response models can consider other disease transmission routes in addition to airborne route and can calculate the infectious source strength of an outbreak in terms of the quantity of the pathogen rather than a hypothetical unit. Spatial distribution of airborne pathogens is one of the most important factors in infection risk assessment of respiratory disease. Respiratory deposition of aerosol induces heterogeneous infectivity of intake pathogens and randomness on the intake dose, which are not being well accounted for in current risk models. Some suggestions for further development of the risk assessment models are proposed. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This review article summarizes the strengths and limitations of the Wells\u2013Riley and the dose\u2010response models for risk assessment of respiratory diseases. Even with many efforts by various investigators to develop and modify the risk assessment models, some limitations still persist. This review serves as a reference for further development of infection risk assessment models of respiratory diseases. The Wells\u2013Riley model and dose\u2010response model offer specific advantages. Risk assessors can select the approach that is suitable to their particular conditions to perform risk assessment.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sze To, G. N.; Chao, C. Y.

Scour vaccines are available against some of the most frequent pathogens responsible for this disease: Bovine Rotavirus (BoRV), Bovine Coronavirus (BoCV) and E. coli K99. In this multi-centre, randomised, blinded study, adult cows vaccinated with a trivalent vaccine marketed for years (Rotavec\u2122 Corona, MSD Animal Health - RC) prior to last parturition were revaccinated 12\u201315 months later, prior to the upcoming parturition, with either a single injection of a recently marketed vaccine (Bovigen\u2122 Scour, Virbac - BS), or RC. The aim of this trial was to verify whether BS is not inferior to RC for the stimulation of the immune response and the passive transfer to calves in these conditions. A total of 136 multiparous dairy cows, from 5 different herds and located in 3 countries (France, UK and Germany) were enrolled in the study. Sixty-five cows were vaccinated with BS and 71 with RC. Antibody levels, measured by competitive ELISA and represented as percentage of inhibition (PI), were assessed in the cow\u0027s serum (on the day of vaccination: D0 and on days 21, 42 and at calving), in the colostrum and in the serum of calves in the first week of life. Differences in means of PI between groups and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The non-inferiority threshold was set at \u221210%. The relationships between antibody levels in the colostrum and the vaccination-calving interval (VCI) or the inter-booster vaccination interval (IBVI) were also analysed. All the lower margins of the 95% CI of the difference in means of PI, in all samples and for the 3 pathogens assessed, were above \u221210%. This result shows that BS is not inferior to RC for the stimulation of the immune response against BoRV, BoCV and E. coli K99 and the passive transfer of immunity to calves when this vaccine is administered to their dams previously vaccinated with RC. Furthermore, no correlation was found between PI values in the colostrum and the VCI or IBVI.

However, the association between other characteristics of social networks and obesity is unclear. This study aimed to identify the association between social network characteristics and body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) in an elderly Korean population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 657 Koreans (273 men, 384 women) aged 60 years or older who participated in the Korean Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. Network size is a count of the number of friends. Density of communication network is the number of connections in the social network reported as a fraction of the total links possible in the personal (ego-centric) network. Average frequency of communication (or meeting) measures how often network members communicate (or meet) each other. The association of each social network measure with BMI was investigated by multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, the men with lower density (\u003C0.71) and higher network size (4-6) had the higher BMI (\u03B2=1.089, p=0.037) compared to the men with higher density (\u003E0.83) and lower size (1-2), but not in the women (p=0.393). The lowest tertile of communication frequency was associated with higher BMI in the women (\u03B2=0.885, p=0.049), but not in the men (p=0.140). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that social network structure (network size and density) and activation (communication frequency and meeting frequency) are associated with obesity among the elderly. There may also be gender differences in this association.","publish_time":"2013-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Won Joon; Youm, Yoosik; Rhee, Yumie; Park, Yeong-Ran; Chu, Sang Hui; Kim, Hyeon Chang","journal":"J Prev Med Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71edbd57cdd9af956a12054932e0cbdb87ce1fea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3859855.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24349655/; https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.2013.46.6.336","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Social Life","Aging Project","BMI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social network characteristics","social network structure","social network measure","Density of communication network","higher network size","social ties","higher BMI","higher density","association","characteristics of social networks","Korean Social Life","meeting frequency","Average frequency of communication","lower density","obesity","women","lower size","lowest tertile of communication frequency","cross-sectional study","elderly Korean population","number of connections","number of friends","activation","body mass index","data","Health","Koreans","fraction","total links possible","potential confounders","multiple linear regression analysis","ego-centric","count","Aging Project","METHODS","measures","RESULTS","members","OBJECTIVES","Research","years","CONCLUSIONS","differences"],"language":"en"},

Its ability to recognize large panoply of viruses and virus-infected cells, and trigger the effector pathways, results in neutralization of viruses and killing of the infected cells. This selection pressure exerted by complement on viruses has made them evolve a multitude of countermeasures. These include targeting the recognition molecules for the avoidance of detection, targeting key enzymes and complexes of the complement pathways like C3 convertases and C5b-9 formation \u2013 either by encoding complement regulators or by recruiting membrane-bound and soluble host complement regulators, cleaving complement proteins by encoding protease, and inhibiting the synthesis of complement proteins. Additionally, viruses also exploit the complement system for their own benefit. For example, they use complement receptors as well as membrane regulators for cellular entry as well as their spread. Here, we provide an overview on the complement subversion mechanisms adopted by the members of various viral families including Poxviridae, Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Togaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae.","publish_time":"2017-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agrawal, Palak; Nawadkar, Renuka; Ojha, Hina; Kumar, Jitendra; Sahu, Arvind","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/130c4c6c7faab2f0c0143b6f0cd0118b27c91dea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5472698.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670306/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complement pathways","complement system","complement receptors","cleaving complement proteins","synthesis of complement proteins","complement subversion mechanisms","soluble host complement regulators","neutralization of viruses","membrane regulators","large panoply of viruses","virus-infected cells","effector pathways","Herpesviridae","Poxviridae","Astroviridae","Picornaviridae","Retroviridae","Flaviviridae","Adenoviridae","members of various viral families","complexes","avoidance of detection","key enzymes","C3 convertases","Togaviridae","C5b","formation","line of immune defense","Orthomyxoviridae","cellular entry","results","protease","constant vigil","recognition molecules","Paramyxoviridae","ability","overview","spread","selection pressure","example","benefit"],"language":"en"},

CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome. His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy. DISCUSSION: Blood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients. Only inpatient with fever hase being tested for COVID-19. All new patients are submitted to SARS-COV-2 Test. Moreover, routine testing of patients who have to participate in therapy in common gym areas may be warranted.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Righi, Gabriele; Del Popolo, Giulio","journal":"Spinal Cord Ser Cases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0043d7e0cd1b41ff48b77a7d0cf2cc97ae57a63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163165.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303672/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41394-020-0274-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIS","Lopinavir/Ritonavir","SCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of COVID","days of therapy","days of antibiotic therapy","antiviral therapy","h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy","fever hase","known clinical course of COVID","CASE PRESENTATION","chest X-ray findings","inpatient","SARS-CoV","C4 tetraplegia","published findings","broad-spectrum antibiotics","new patients","routine testing of patients","urinary tract infection","year-old male","need","SCI professionals","Blood test","AIS","high index of suspicion","rehabilitation","general practitioner","local hospital","DISCUSSION","Lopinavir","Ritonavir","night","results","individual","common gym areas","best knowledge","worsening","viral pneumonia","hydroxychloroquine","outpatient clients","interesting feature","difference","tetraplegic person","Persons","spinal unit","INTRODUCTION","report","prodrome","cough"],"language":"en"},

Timely and accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections improves patient care and minimizes unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. We sought to develop a rapid nucleic acid tests for the detection of RSV within minutes, while retaining the high sensitivity achieved with RT-PCR. METHODS: We developed and evaluated a reverse transcription isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of RSV. RESULTS: The developed RT-SIBA assay showed good sensitivity by detecting as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA within 20 min compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which took approximately 2 h. The performance of the RT-SIBA RSV assay was further investigated using nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The RT-SIBA assay had a sensitivity of 100% (25/25) and a specificity of 100% (15/15). CONCLUSION: RT-SIBA did not require highly purified RNA for the rapid detection of RSV and was therefore compatible with rapid specimen processing methods. This reduces the complexity of specimen preparation and further shortens the total amount of time needed to detect RSV in clinical specimens.

Screening and PPE guidelines for both patient and staff should be followed closely, as determined by hospital administration and the CDC. Equipment needs are also greatly affected in an outbreak; we emphasis portable radiographic equipment to limit transport, and an upstocking of certain medications, respiratory supplies, and PPE.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whiteside, Tess; Kane, Erin; Aljohani, Bandar; Alsamman, Marya; Pourmand, Ali","journal":"Am J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddf2e41081955599408908ecf6b211f5a0846462.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156950.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336583/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S073567572030262X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073567572030262X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["limit patient inflow","pandemic","current COVID","Equipment needs","viral respiratory disease outbreaks","staggering patient volume","respiratory supplies","departmental operations","past outbreaks","PPE guidelines","changing needs","hospital administration","times of elevated disease burden","emphasis portable radiographic equipment","community-based care","transport","designated unit","upstocking of certain medications","surge capacity","cohort symptomatic patients","emergency departments","areas of intervention","paper addresses ways","strategies","exposure","experience","Screening","staff","crowding","Triage","CDC"],"language":"en"},

Our study is the first to analyze the characteristics of HBoV-positive samples from ARTI patients with a wide age distribution from Guangzhou, southern China. METHODS: Throat swabs (n=2811) were collected and analyzed from children and adults with ARTI over a 13-month period. The HBoV complete genome from a 60 year-old female patient isolate was also determined. RESULTS: HBoV DNA was detected in 65/2811 (2.3%) samples, of which 61/1797 were from children (\u003C18 years old) and 4/1014 from adults (\u226518 years old). Seasonal peaks of 4.8% and 7.7% were detected in May and June, respectively. 28 of 65 (43.1%) HBoV-positive samples were co-detected with 11/16 other potential pathogens. Mycoplasma pneumoniae had the highest frequency of 16.9% (11/65). Upper and lower respiratory tract illness were common symptoms, with 19/65 (29.2%) patients diagnosed with pneumonia by chest radiography. All four adult patients had systemic influenza-like symptoms. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome revealed a close relationship with other HBoVs, and a more distant relationship with HBoV2 and HBoV3. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV was detected from children and adults with ARTI from Guangzhou, southern China. Elderly people were also susceptive to HBoV. A single lineage of HBoV was detected among a wide age distribution of patients with ARTI.","publish_time":"2011-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wen-Kuan; Chen, De-Hui; Liu, Qian; Liang, Huan-Xi; Yang, Zi-Feng; Qin, Sheng; Zhou, Rong","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a6f6369bb9df09d06938f9ef8fdceb72de53a21.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3267697.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22168387/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARTI"],"locations":["Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["ARTI patients","characteristics of HBoV","HBoV DNA","HBoV-positive samples","HBoV complete genome","single lineage of HBoV","adults","children","wide age distribution of patients","adult patients","lower respiratory tract illness","acute respiratory tract illness","gastrointestinal illness","Guangzhou","southern China","years old","common symptoms","distant relationship","close relationship","discovered parvovirus","year-old female patient isolate","HBoVs","systemic influenza","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","highest frequency","METHODS","Throat swabs","HBoV2","HBoV3","chest radiography","Phylogenetic analysis","BACKGROUND","Human bocavirus","Elderly people","potential pathogens","month period","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","Seasonal peaks","study"],"language":"en"},

In Senegal, the network has recently been enhanced (i) to include epidemiological data from Dakar and other regions and (ii) to extend virological surveillance to other respiratory viruses. Epidemiological data from the sentinel sites is transmitted daily by mobile phone. The data include those for other febrile syndromes similar to influenza-like illnesses (ILI), corresponding to integrated approach. Also, clinical samples are randomly selected and analyzed for influenza and other respiratory viruses. There were 101,640 declared visits to the 11 sentinel sites between week 11-2012 and week 35-2013; 22% of the visits were for fever syndromes and 23% of the cases of fever syndrome were ILI. Influenza viruses were the second most frequent cause of ILI (20%), after adenoviruses (21%) and before rhinoviruses (18%) and enteroviruses (15%). Co-circulation and co-infection were frequent and were responsible for ILI peaks. The first months of implementation of the enhanced surveillance system confirmed that viruses other the influenza make large contributions to influenza-like illnesses. It is therefore important to consider these etiologies in the development of strategies to reduce respiratory infections.

Gene 7 is only present in members of coronavirus genus a1, and encodes a hydrophobic protein of 78 aa. To study gene 7 function, a recombinant TGEV virus lacking gene 7 was engineered (rTGEV-\u03947). Both the mutant and the parental (rTGEV-wt) viruses showed the same growth and viral RNA accumulation kinetics in tissue cultures. Nevertheless, cells infected with rTGEV-\u03947 virus showed an increased cytopathic effect caused by an enhanced apoptosis mediated by caspase activation. Macromolecular synthesis analysis showed that rTGEV-\u03947 virus infection led to host translational shut-off and increased cellular RNA degradation compared with rTGEV-wt infection. An increase of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03B1) phosphorylation and an enhanced nuclease, most likely RNase L, activity were observed in rTGEV-\u03947 virus infected cells. These results suggested that the removal of gene 7 promoted an intensified dsRNA-activated host antiviral response. In protein 7 a conserved sequence motif that potentially mediates binding to protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c), a key regulator of the cell antiviral defenses, was identified. We postulated that TGEV protein 7 may counteract host antiviral response by its association with PP1c. In fact, pull-down assays demonstrated the interaction between TGEV protein 7, but not a protein 7 mutant lacking PP1c binding motif, with PP1. Moreover, the interaction between protein 7 and PP1 was required, during the infection, for eIF2\u03B1 dephosphorylation and inhibition of cell RNA degradation. Inoculation of newborn piglets with rTGEV-\u03947 and rTGEV-wt viruses showed that rTGEV-\u03947 virus presented accelerated growth kinetics and pathology compared with the parental virus. Overall, the results indicated that gene 7 counteracted host cell defenses, and modified TGEV persistence increasing TGEV survival. Therefore, the acquisition of gene 7 by the TGEV genome most likely has provided a selective advantage to the virus.","publish_time":"2011-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruz, Jazmina L.

This study investigated risk factors for the development of wheezing during viral LRTIs requiring hospitalization. METHODS: The study included 142 children \u003C2 years of age hospitalized for LRTIs with at least one virus identified as the cause and classified them into children diagnosed with LRTIs with wheezing (n=70) and those diagnosed with LRTIs without wheezing (n=72). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the viruses detected between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for potentially confounding variables including sex and age, the development of wheezing was strongly associated with parental history of allergic diseases (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 20.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.22-126.48), past history of allergic diseases (aOR, 13.95; 95% CI, 1.34-145.06), past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses (aOR, 21.36; 95% CI, 3.77-120.88), exposure to secondhand smoke at home (aOR, 14.45; 95% CI, 4.74-44.07), and total eosinophil count (aOR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02).

Patients in the HCAP group were thought to be at high risk for pneumonia because of multidrug resistant organisms and required empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy much like people with hospital-acquired infection. Subsequent studies of the etiology of NHAP using sophisticated diagnostic testing found limited evidence of resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or resistant gram-negative organisms or atypical organisms. In terms of management of NHAP in the nursing home there are several considerations that are discussed: hospitalization decision, initial oral or parenteral therapy, timing of switch to an oral regimen if parenteral therapy is initially prescribed, duration of therapy with an emphasis on shorter courses, and follow-up during therapy including the use of the \u201Cantibiotic time out\u201D protocol. The oral and parenteral antibiotic regimens recommended for treatment of NHAP in this report are based on limited information because there are no randomized controlled trials to define the optimum regimen. In conclusion, most residents with pneumonia can be treated successfully in the nursing home. However, there is an urgent need for a specific NHAP diagnosis and treatment guideline that will give providers guidance in the management of this infection in the nursing home.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mylotte, Joseph M.","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/845e0e1132ba012c351cb1384290f83c64560aff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105974.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861020300372; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861020300372; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.01.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32061505/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCAP","NHAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nursing home residents","treatment of NHAP","etiology of NHAP","parenteral therapy","narrative review of nursing home-associated pneumonia","multidrug resistant organisms","resistant gram-negative organisms","duration of therapy","limited evidence of resistant organisms","specific NHAP diagnosis","atypical organisms","empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy","oral regimen","parenteral antibiotic regimens","designation healthcare-associated pneumonia","treatment guideline","antibiotic time","HCAP group","HCAP category","infection","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","limited information","optimum regimen","terms of management","CAP guidelines","sophisticated diagnostic testing","timing of switch","people","hospitalization decision","follow-up","emphasis","shorter courses","high risk","randomized controlled trials","providers guidance","urgent need","use","considerations","report","parts","community","Subsequent studies","belief","Patients","protocol","conclusion","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

The laryngeal anatomy of young children makes them particularly susceptible to upper airway obstruction, and during acute infections this is exacerbated by inflammation and edema of the airway mucosa. The most common cause of infective upper airway obstruction in children is viral laryngotracheobronchitis, or croup, which is usually a mild and self-limiting illness, but management with corticosteroids may still be necessary. Bacterial causes of upper airway obstruction have fortunately become rare since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae B (HiB) immunization, but a few cases of epiglottitis do still occur due to nonimmunization, vaccine failure, and infection with non-HiB organisms. These cases constitute a medical emergency due to the risk of rapid progression to complete airway obstruction. Other rare conditions are discussed including bacterial tracheitis, diphtheria, retropharyngeal, and peritonsillar abscesses. Key learning points in this chapter include the main discriminating factors of the various causes of infective upper airway obstruction, the importance of a calm and minimally distressing approach to the child presenting with stridor, and the need for early anesthetic team involvement in cases with a suspected bacterial etiology or signs of impending airway obstruction.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balfour-Lynn, Ian Michael; Wright, Marie","journal":"Kendig\u0027s Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/508f04c31e56be8a13f63aa5689d0de750ebc978.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323448871000237; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323448871000237","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complete airway obstruction","Bacterial causes of upper airway obstruction","various causes of infective upper airway obstruction","airway mucosa","common cause of infective upper airway obstruction","signs of impending airway obstruction","serious infective causes of acute upper airway obstruction","bacterial tracheitis","chapter","cases of epiglottitis","suspected bacterial etiology","acute infections","laryngeal anatomy of young children","rare conditions","non-HiB organisms","early anesthetic team involvement","importance","main discriminating factors","risk of rapid progression","Haemophilus influenzae B","viral laryngotracheobronchitis","management","need","diphtheria","inflammation","vaccine failure","corticosteroids","self-limiting illness","distressing approach","stridor","nonimmunization","introduction","croup","calm","medical emergency","Key learning points","peritonsillar abscesses","edema"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Introduction: Ischaemic stroke has been reported in patients with COVID-19, particularly in more severe cases. However, it is unclear to what extent this is linked to systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability secondary to the infection. Materials and methods: We describe the cases of 4 patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 who were attended at our hospital. Patients are classified according to the likelihood of a causal relationship between the hypercoagulable state and ischaemic stroke. We also conducted a review of studies addressing the possible mechanisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of ischaemic stroke in these patients. Results: The association between COVID-19 and stroke was probably causal in 2 patients, who presented cortical infarcts and had no relevant arterial or cardioembolic disease, but did show signs of hypercoagulability and systemic inflammation in laboratory analyses. The other 2 patients were of advanced age and presented cardioembolic ischaemic stroke; the association in these patients was probably incidental. Conclusions: Systemic inflammation and the potential direct action of the virus may cause endothelial dysfunction, resulting in a hypercoagulable state that could be considered a potential cause of ischaemic stroke. However, stroke involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms; studies with larger samples are therefore needed to confirm our hypothesis. The management protocol for patients with stroke and COVID-19 should include a complete aetiological study, with the appropriate safety precautions always being observed.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mar\u00EDa Barrios-L\u00F3pez, Jos\u00E9; Rego-Garc\u00EDa, Iago; Mart\u00EDnez, Claudia Mu\u00F1oz; Romero-F\u00E1brega, Juan Carlos; Rodr\u00EDguez, Mar Rivero; Gim\u00E9nez, Jes\u00FAs Antonio Ruiz; Escamilla-Sevilla, Francisco; M\u00EDnguez-Castellanos, Adolfo; P\u00E9rez, Mar\u00EDa Dolores Fern\u00E1ndez","journal":"Neurologia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/209d7a85764f38f4108bbedee5bc4a00a52ccf11.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213485320300955; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485320300955?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Resumen","Resultados","Dos","Mientras"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","ictus en pacientes","ictus isqu\u00E9mico y COVID","cardioembolic ischaemic stroke","aetiopathogenesis of ischaemic stroke","ictus isqu\u00E9mico en este contexto","potential cause of ischaemic stroke","hipercoagulabilidad y","ictus isqu\u00E9mico se consider\u00F3 cardioemb\u00F3lico","inflamaci\u00F3n sist\u00E9mica e hipercoagulabilidad producidas en","cuatro pacientes atendidos en nuestro Centro por ictus isqu\u00E9mico y diagn\u00F3stico","se desconoce en qu\u00E9 medida podr\u00EDa estar en relaci\u00F3n","adaptaciones necesarias en relaci\u00F3n","Dos pacientes se consideraron","ictus pueden ser m\u00FAltiples","systemic inflammation","mayor frecuencia en aquellos pacientes m\u00E1s graves","literatura sobre los posibles mecanismos implicados en","Sin embargo","causal relationship","edad avanzada y","Se ha comunicado","alta probabilidad causal","probabilidad causal entre","puesto que los mecanismos","otras dos pacientes eran","estado","hipercoagulabilidad que podr\u00EDa considerarse una causa potencial","circunstancias cl\u00EDnicas y epidemiol\u00F3gicas","virus","hypercoagulable state","association","se precisan estudios m\u00E1s amplios que eval\u00FAen esta hip\u00F3tesis","los protocolos vigentes","sin patolog\u00EDa cardioemb\u00F3lica ni arterial significativa","una probable asociaci\u00F3n casual","possible mechanisms","signs of hypercoagulability","cardioembolic disease","hypercoagulability secondary","review of studies","severe cases","multiple pathophysiological mechanisms","potential direct action","debe ser sistem\u00E1tico atendiendo","etiopatogenia","presentaban infartos corticales","generando","par\u00E1metros","provocar\u00EDa disfunci\u00F3n endotelial","posible acci\u00F3n directa","estudio etiol\u00F3gico","junto","grado","Descripci\u00F3n","clasific\u00E1ndolos seg\u00FAn","advanced age","larger samples","actual pandemia","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n","complete aetiological study","appropriate safety precautions","Revisi\u00F3n","M\u00E9todos","endothelial dysfunction","cortical infarcts","laboratory analyses","Resultados","Mientras tanto","management protocol","infection","Conclusiones","infecci\u00F3n","Conclusions","likelihood","Abstract Introduction","methods","extent","Results","Materials","hospital","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Concurrently, four parameters of open-field Behavior I.E.

To investigate their potential role in respiratory disease, we determined their frequencies of detection, clinical presentations and epidemiological characteristics among samples referred for diagnostic respiratory virus testing. Methods Anonymised samples and accompanying study subject information were obtained from the Edinburgh respiratory specimen archive. Samples were screened by nested PCR using two sets of primers conserved between WUV and KIPyV, as well for other respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenoviruses [AdV], influenza A/B and parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133, human bocavirus, B19). Results and Conclusions WUV and KIPyV were detected in 10 and 14 samples, respectively from 983 specimens (from 9 to 10 different individuals from 612 study subjects). Infections occurred in two types of study subject; those who were young (\u003C2 years) with lower respiratory tract infections (n =8), and almost invariably co-infected with other respiratory viruses (RSV, AdV), and a second, generally older group either without respiratory disease (n =6) or with mild upper respiratory tract infections (n =5) but who were generally clinically severely immunosuppressed from leukaemia or transplant therapy. Findings from either group do not support an aetiological link between infection with WUV or KIPyV and respiratory disease.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Norja, P.; Ubillos, I.; Templeton, K.; Simmonds, P.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172997.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653207003423; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653207003423","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["WU"],"organizations":["KI","WUV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory samples","respiratory viruses","respiratory disease","respiratory syncytial virus","lower respiratory tract infections","diagnostic respiratory virus testing","KIPyV","mild upper respiratory tract infections","Edinburgh respiratory specimen archive","Conclusions WUV","RSV","parainfluenza viruses","types of study subject","study subjects","AdV","accompanying study subject information","Abstract Background WU virus","human bocavirus","older group","discovered related human polyomaviruses","epidemiological characteristics","clinical presentations","frequencies of detection","adenoviruses","years","KI polyomavirus","sets of primers","aetiological link","nested PCR","Methods","different individuals","leukaemia","transplant therapy","Results","potential role","B19","specimens","Findings"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiological profiles of the MERS-CoV infections suggest zoonotic transmission from an animal reservoir to humans. METHODS: This study was designed to investigate animal herds associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-infected patients in Saudi Arabia, during the last three years (2014\u20132016). Nasal swabs and serum samples from 584 dromedary camels, 39 sheep, 51 goats, and 2 cattle were collected. Nasal samples from camels, sheep, goats, and cattle were examined by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect MERS-CoV RNA, and the Anti-MERS ELISA assay was performed to detect camel humeral immune response (IgG) to MERS-CoV S1 antigen infection. The complete genome sequencing of ten MERS-CoV camel isolates and phylogenetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: The data indicated that seventy-five dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA; the virus was not detected in sheep, goats, and cattle. MERS-CoV RNA from infected camels was not detected beyond 2 weeks after the first positive result was detected in nasal swabs obtained from infected camels. Anti-MERS ELISA assays showed that 70.9% of camels related to human cases had antibodies to MERS-CoV. The full genome sequences of the ten MERS-CoV camel isolates were identical to their corresponding patients and were grouped together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster for human and camel isolates reported form the Arabian Peninsula. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that camels are a significant reservoir for the maintenance of MERS-CoVs, and they are an important source of human infection with MERS.","publish_time":"2017-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kasem, Samy; Qasim, Ibraheem; Al-Hufofi, Ali; Hashim, Osman; Alkarar, Ali; Abu-Obeida, Ali; Gaafer, Albagir; Elfadil, Abdelhamid; Zaki, Ahmed; Al-Romaihi, Ahmed; Babekr, Nasereldeen; El-Harby, Nadr; Hussien, Raed; AL-Sahaf, Ali; Al-Doweriej, Ali; Bayoumi, Faisal; Poon, Leo L.M.; Chu, Daniel K.W.; Peiris, Malik; Perera, Ranawaka A.P.M.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d1e612e20a20982d6e1a7cd01bccef469cc549f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102853.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28993171/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2017.09.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034117302575; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034117302575","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","Arabian Peninsula"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV RNA","MERS-CoV infections","MERS-CoV camel isolates","maintenance of MERS","larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster","MERS-CoV S1 antigen infection","Anti-MERS ELISA assays","infected camels","dromedary camels","sheep","goats","cattle","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","infected patients","Nasal swabs","Nasal samples","human cases","animal reservoir","humans","genome sequences","camel humeral immune response","important source of human infection","severe respiratory disease","RT-PCR","animal herds","serum samples","significant reservoir","positive result","corresponding patients","emerged coronavirus","complete genome sequencing","real-time reverse-transcription PCR","IgG","zoonotic transmission","BACKGROUND","antibodies","phylogenetic analysis","Saudi Arabia","epidemiological profiles","study","findings","CoVs","data","Arabian Peninsula","weeks","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS","years"],"language":"en"},

Bats are reservoirs of, or can be infected by, several viral diseases, including rabies virus strains (in the Lyssavirus genus). Within this genus are bat variants that have been recorded in Europe; European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1), European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2) and, four currently unclassified isolates. Since 1977, 783 cases of EBLVs (by isolation of viral RNA) have been recorded in Europe. EBLV-1 or EBLV-2 has been identified in 12 bat species, with over 95% of EBLV-1 infections identified in Eptesicus serotinus. EBLV-2 is associated with Myotis species (Myotis daubentonii and Myotis dasycneme). A programme of passive surveillance in the United Kingdom between 1987 and 2004 tested 4871 bats for lyssaviruses. Of these, four M. daubentonii (3.57% of submitted M. daubentonii) were positive for EBLV-2. Potential bias in the passive surveillance includes possible over-representation of synanthropic species and regional biases caused by varying bat submission numbers from different parts of the UK. In 2003, active surveillance in the UK began, and has detected an antibody prevalence level of 1\u20135% of EBLV-2 in M. daubentonii (n =350), and one bat with antibodies to EBLV-1 in E. serotinus (n =52). No cases of live lyssavirus infection or lyssavirus viral RNA have been detected through active surveillance. Further research and monitoring regarding prevalence, transmission, pathogenesis and immunity is required to ensure that integrated bat conservation continues throughout Europe, whilst enabling informed policy decision regarding both human and wildlife health issues.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harris, S.

Our objective was to compare health and performance of PC or AM management systems with (PI) or without (CON) presence of a PI-BVDV pen mate using a 2 \u00D7 2 factorial arrangement. Four shipment blocks of crossbred PC steers (n = 236) from 3 ranch-origins were weaned, dewormed, vaccinated, tested for PI-BVDV, and kept on the ranch for \u226542 d. Subsequently, PC steers were transported to a stocker receiving unit (RU), weighed (251 \u00B1 2 kg), blood sampled, stratified by d \u22121 BW, and assigned randomly to treatment (PCPI or PCCON) with no additional processing. Simultaneously, 4 blocks of crossbred AM calves (n = 292) were assembled from regional auction markets and transported to the RU \u00B1 36 h from PC arrival. The AM calves were weighed (245 \u00B1 1.3 kg), stratified by gender and d \u22121 BW, processed under the same regimen used for PC steers at their origin ranch except bull calves were castrated, and then assigned randomly to treatment (AMPI or AMCON). Treatment pens (0.45 ha) were arranged spatially such that PI did not have fence-line or water source contact with CON. Calves were fed identically and followed the same antibiotic treatment protocol. Daily BW gain for the entire 42-d receiving trial was greater (P \u003C 0.001) for PC (1.2 kg) compared with AM (0.85 kg). There was an exposure effect (P = 0.002) on ADG from d 28 to 42; CON gained 1.12 kg vs. 0.90 kg BW for PI cohort. Morbidity was markedly greater (P \u003C 0.001) in AM (70%) vs. PC (7%), resulting in (P \u003C 0.001) an antibiotic treatment cost of $20.52 and $2.48/animal, respectively. Treatment with a third antibiotic occurred more often (P = 0.04) for PI cohort, and the percentage of chronically ill cattle was greatest (P = 0.06) for AMPI. Upon arrival, BVDV type 1a, 1b, and 2a titers were greater for PC (treatment \u00D7 day, P \u003C 0.001), and the percentage seropositive to BVDV type 1a on d 0 was 100% for PC vs. 23% in AM. Platelets increased transiently (P \u003C 0.001) with greater platelets observed in AM (P \u003C 0.001). Results indicate that PC calves gain faster and require fewer antibiotic treatments during the receiving period. Exposure to PI reduced BW gain from d 28 to 42, increased the number of calves treated thrice, and increased chronically ill cattle for AM.","publish_time":"2012-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richeson, J.

Leukocytes activated in an adaptive immune response access brain tissue by passing through the blood\u2013brain barrier. The chemokine CCL5/RANTES is involved in recruitment of these cells to the brain acting via the receptors CCR1, CCR3 and mainly CCR5. Here, we evaluated the role of CCR5 on traffic of leukocytes in the brain microvasculature, cellular and cytokines profile in a severe form of herpetic encephalitis. RESULTS: Wild type and mice lacking CCR5 (CCR5(-/-)) were inoculated intracerebrally with 10(4) PFU of neurotropic HSV-1. We evaluated the traffic of leukocytes in the brain microvasculature using intravital microscopy and the profile of cytokines by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay at 1 day post infection. Flow cytometry and histopathological analyses were also carried out in brain tissue. Absence of CCR5 leads to lower viral load and an increased leukocyte adhesion in brain microvasculature, predominantly of neutrophils (CD11(\u002B) Ly6G(\u002B) cells). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the levels of MIP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, KC/CXCL1 and MIG/CXCL9 in the brain of infected CCR5(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the absence of CCR5 may boost the immune response with a high neutrophil recruitment which most likely helps in viral clearance. Nonetheless, the elevated immune response may be detrimental to the host.","publish_time":"2013-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vilela, M\u00E1rcia Carvalho; Lima, Graciela Kunrath; Rodrigues, David Henrique; Lacerda-Queiroz, Norinne; Pedroso, Vinicius Sousa Pietra; Miranda, Aline Silva; Rachid, Milene Alvarenga; Kroon, Erna Geessien; Campos, Marco Ant\u00F4nio; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; Sellner, Johann; Teixeira, Antonio Lucio","journal":"BMC Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/055ed1f10bcc96eacefe967b946a0b8c1674e197.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3618319.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2202-14-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23391218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["brain microvasculature","brain of infected CCR5","brain barrier","role of CCR5","Absence of CCR5","adaptive immune response access brain tissue","elevated immune response","neuroinflammatory response","traffic of leukocytes","cytokines profile","profile of cytokines","RANTES","viral clearance","RESULTS","mice","cells","severe form of herpetic encephalitis","key role","chemokine CCL5","lower viral load","high neutrophil recruitment","PFU of neurotropic HSV","clearance of herpes simplex virus","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","increased leukocyte adhesion","KC","CXCL9","pathogenesis of neuroaxonal damage","intravital microscopy","CCL2","CXCL1","MIG","day post infection","levels of MIP","Wild type","neutrophils","receptors CCR1","blood","histopathological analyses","Flow cytometry","significant increase","Ly6G","CD11","CCR3","BACKGROUND","host","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This immunochromatography (IC)-based assay, which employs two monoclonal anti-CDV antibodies, was compared with nested PCR. When serial dilutions of purified CDV were tested, the CDV detection limits of the nested PCR and IC assays were 2\u00D7102 TCID50/ml and 5\u00D7102 TCID50/ml, respectively. Nasal irrigation fluid, conjunctival swabs, and blood lymphocytes from 66 dogs suspected to have CD were tested. Preliminary IC experiments revealed that the optimal sample volume and reaction time were 100\u03BCl and 5min, respectively. Relative to nested PCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the IC assay was maximal (100% and 100%, respectively) when conjunctival swabs were tested. This is significant because conjunctival swab specimens are easy to obtain in the early phase of CD infection. However, with blood lymphocytes and nasal samples, the IC assay was slightly less sensitive (89.7% and 85.7%, respectively) and specific (94.6% and 100%, respectively) than nested PCR. Since this novel IC assay does not require special instruments, it is a simple enough for dog owners to use. Since early detection of CD would allow appropriate treatment and quarantine to be instituted quickly, such a test would help reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with CD help to prevent its spread to other animals.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"An, Dong-Jun; Kim, Tae-Young; Song, Dae-Sub; Kang, Bo-Kyu; Park, Bong-Kyun","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26abbc6b4bd603375adc90736fda5e3e2034614f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119767.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093407003618; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093407003618","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV","IC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel IC assay","nested PCR","IC assays","based assay","new assay","early detection of CD","Preliminary IC experiments","conjunctival swabs","early phase of CD infection","CDV detection limits","blood lymphocytes","TCID50","conjunctival swab specimens","monoclonal anti-CDV antibodies","nasal samples","serial dilutions of purified CDV","Nasal irrigation fluid","optimal sample volume","sensitivity","specificity","antemortem diagnosis of canine distemper","reaction time","appropriate treatment","special instruments","\u03BCl","morbidity","quarantine","dogs","immunochromatography","dog owners","spread","mortality","animals","test"],"language":"en"},

PyVs have previously been considered highly host restricted in mammalian hosts, with host-switching events thought rare or nonexistent. Prior investigations have revealed short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus. Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of PyV than geographic distance. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence of inter-family host-switching events of PyV in mammals and challenge the prevailing evolutionary paradigm for strict host restriction of mammalian PyVs. Since the discovery of murine polyomavirus in the 1950s, polyomaviruses (PyVs) have been considered both genetically stable and highly host-restricted in their mammalian hosts. In this study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans.","publish_time":"2019-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Zhizhou; Gonzalez, Gabriel; Sheng, Jinliang; Wu, Jianmin; Zhang, Fuqiang; Xu, Lin; Zhang, Peisheng; Zhu, Aiwei; Qu, Yonggang; Tu, Changchun; Carr, Michael J.; He, Biao","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/038a3da284e0ee74fa32bb557357bc8f37ef68a6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f810de29894bfa40d93bc6dde3efc22c9d0d3f4c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/627158","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["events of PyVs","host-switching","host species","diverse PyVs","evolution of PyVs","bat families","short-range host","different bat species","different host family","diverse bat species","strict host restriction of mammalian PyVs","multiple bat species","different African bat species","Chinese horseshoe bat species","inter-family PyV host","bats of different species","multiple cases of host","respective bat hosts","intra-host divergence","systematic investigation of PyVs","horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae","indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs","host-specific DNA viruses","evidence of inter-family host","African horseshoe bats","horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus","archived bat samples","modeling of bat zoonoses","spillover events","different families","mammalian hosts","present day bats","evolutionary divergence of PyV","involved members of bats","virulent viruses","present study","evolutionary scheme","double-stranded DNA tumor viruses","diverse vertebrates","mammals","estimated tMRCA","humans","China","Polyomaviruses","findings","MYA","prevailing evolutionary paradigm","large population","co-evolution","large scale surveillance","close genetic identities","VP1","increased propensity","Hipposideridae","assessment","frequent contacts","effects of positive selection","ecological niche","Emballonuridae","Vespertilionidae","transmission","Miniopteridae","recent common ancestor","provinces","geographic distance","colony","domestic animals","useful model","time","Pteropodidae","discovery of murine polyomavirus","Correlation analysis","Prior investigations","number","conclusion","years"],"language":"en"},

A conventional virus is made up of 2 or 3 major components. A nucleic acid genome, which can be Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) or Ribonucleic Acid (RNA), single or double-stranded, contiguous or segmented, contains all the genetic information and encodes all the virus-specific macromolecules of the pathogen. The molecular and pathogenic aspects of their biology are grouped in terms of their genomic organization. Molecular characterization of these pathogens provides an understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis, rational drug design, molecular signatures that can be used to trace outbreaks of viral disease\u2026 An overview of the six families of DNA and 15 families of RNA viruses, based on their molecular properties and life cycles is presented. The utility and issues surrounding the use of molecular forensics and epidemiology to the world of virology are exemplified, for instance, because of rapid sequencing techniques detailed fingerprints of viruses provide important clues about their source. Like other microbial species, the analysis of viral genomic segments can provide important clues as to the relatedness and origins of infections. Given their small size and high rate of evolution, several considerations should be kept in mind when applying comparative molecular forensic analyses to viruses. The tracking of HIV infections exemplifies the successful application of molecular forensics to identify the source of a viral infection.

Health care facilities in the USA currently do not have an adequate supply of COVID-19 tests to meet the growing demand. Imaging findings for COVID-19 are non-specific but include pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacities in a predominantly basal and peripheral distribution. METHODS: Three patients were imaged for non-respiratory-related symptoms with a portion of the lungs in the imaged field. RESULTS: Each patient had suspicious imaging findings for COVID-19, prompting the interpreting radiologist to suggest testing for COVID-19. All 3 patients turned out to be infected with COVID-19, and one patient is the first reported case of the coincident presentation of COVID-19 and an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Using imaging characteristics of COVID-19 on abdominal or neck CT when a portion of the lungs is included, patients not initially suspected of COVID-19 infection can be quarantined earlier to limit exposure to others.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vu, David; Ruggiero, Maryanne; Choi, Woo Sung; Masri, Daniel; Flyer, Mark; Shyknevsky, Inna; Stein, Evan G.","journal":"Emerg Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95cb253464ac65573c2724b884fc2d846e71e65f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152619.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10140-020-01775-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32285222/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["imaging characteristics of COVID","coincident presentation of COVID","adequate supply of COVID","patients","Coronavirus disease","portion","suspicious imaging findings","lungs","novel strain of coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","imaged field","non-respiratory-related symptoms","pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacities","tests","reported case","USA","SARS-CoV","neck CT","interpreting radiologist","Health care facilities","testing","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE","peripheral distribution","growing demand","intraparenchymal hemorrhage","METHODS","infection","globe","exposure"],"language":"en"},

Mexico, since 2003 had developed a National Preparedness and Response Plan for an Influenza Pandemic focused in risk communication, health promotion, healthcare, epidemiological surveillance, strategic stockpile, research and development. This plan was challenged on April 2009, when a new influenza A(H1N1) strain of swine origen was detected in Mexico. The situation faced, the decisions and actions taken, allowed to control the first epidemic wave in the country. This document describes the critical moments faced and explicitly point out the lessons learned focused on the decided support by the government, the National Pandemic Influenza Plan, the coordination among all the government levels, the presence and solidarity of international organizations with timely and daily information, diagnosis and the positive effect on the population following the preventive hygienic measures recommended by the health authorities.

Host cells produce cytokines and chemokines in response to viral infection, and among such effector molecules, type I interferons are the principal antiviral cytokines and therefore effective targets for viruses to disarm host surveillance. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) expresses proteins that circumvent the IFN response and other cellular processes, and to compensate the small coding capacity of PRRSV, these proteins are multifunctional. To date, at least four viral proteins have been identified and studied as viral antagonists of host defenses: N as a structural protein and three non-structural proteins, Nsp1 (Nsp1\u03B1 and Nsp1\u03B2), Nsp2, and Nsp11. Among these, N and Nsp1 are nuclear-cytoplasmic proteins distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. Nsp1 and Nsp2 are viral proteases while Nsp11 is an endoribonuclease. This review describes the current understanding of the role of these proteins in modulating the host innate immune responses. Blocking against virus-mediated inhibition of the innate response may lead to the future development of effective vaccines. The understanding of viral mechanisms modulating the normal cellular processes will be a key to the design of an effective control strategy for PRRS.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoo, Dongwan; Song, Cheng; Sun, Yan; Du, Yijun; Kim, Oekyung; Liu, Hsiao-Ching","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92fa1b14f2644d87fb2117e50b6372a5d3c5fb59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114477.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20655963/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.07.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210002467; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210002467","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteins","host cells","viral infection","host surveillance","viral proteases","viral antagonists of host defenses","non-structural proteins","understanding of viral mechanisms","nuclear-cytoplasmic proteins","innate response","effective targets","IFN response","viruses","immune surveillance system","cytoplasm of cells","Nsp2","Nsp11","normal cellular processes","effective control strategy","future development of effective vaccines","current understanding","immune responses","principal antiviral cytokines","respiratory syndrome virus","virus-mediated inhibition","small coding capacity of PRRSV","chemokines","interferons","key","Nsp1\u03B1","Nsp1\u03B2","design","nucleus","effector molecules","role","endoribonuclease","efficient proliferation","review","date"],"language":"en"},

We analyzed six different cell lines from either Yinpterochiroptera (including African flying foxes and a rhinolophid bat) or Yangochiroptera (genera Carollia and Tadarida) for susceptibility to infection by different enveloped RNA viruses. None of the cells were sensitive to infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, or to infection mediated by the Spike (S) protein of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) incorporated into pseudotypes based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The resistance to infection was overcome if cells were transfected to express the respective cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N for TGEV or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for SARS-CoV. VSV pseudotypes containing the S proteins of two bat SARS-related CoV (Bg08 and Rp3) were unable to infect any of the six tested bat cell lines. By contrast, viral pseudotypes containing the surface protein GP of Marburg virus from the family Filoviridae infected all six cell lines though at different efficiency. Notably, all cells were sensitive to infection by two paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus) and three influenza viruses from different subtypes. These results indicate that bat cells are more resistant to infection by coronaviruses than to infection by paramyxoviruses, filoviruses and influenza viruses. Furthermore, these results show a receptor-dependent restriction of the infection of bat cells by CoV. The implications for the isolation of coronaviruses from bats are discussed.","publish_time":"2013-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffmann, Markus; M\u00FCller, Marcel Alexander; Drexler, Jan Felix; Glende, J\u00F6rg; Erdt, Meike; G\u00FCtzkow, Tim; Losemann, Christoph; Binger, Tabea; Deng, Hongkui; Schwegmann-We\u00DFels, Christel; Esser, Karl-Heinz; Drosten, Christian; Herrler, Georg","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4903f4b49cff9b009f9413ae245ecb75bd97960c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3758312.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24023659/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072942","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of bat cells","SARS-CoV","bat SARS-related CoV","different cell lines","Sendai virus","rhinolophid bat","protein of SARS","influenza viruses","tested bat cell lines","different enveloped RNA viruses","VSV pseudotypes","different subtypes","different efficiency","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","vesicular stomatitis virus","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","surface protein GP of Marburg virus","TGEV","paramyxoviruses","porcine coronavirus","viral pseudotypes","Bats","filoviruses","results","host major human pathogenic viruses","S proteins","isolation of coronaviruses","porcine aminopeptidase N","respective cellular receptor","receptor-dependent restriction","susceptibility","angiotensin","Yinpterochiroptera","Bg08","genera Carollia","family Filoviridae","African flying foxes","Yangochiroptera","Tadarida","Rp3","enzyme","Spike","rhabdo","contrast","implications","resistance"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies on COVID-19 mostly included older hospitalized-adults. Little information on infectivity among and characteristics of youngsters with COVID-19 is available. METHODS: A cluster of 22 close-contacts of a 22-year-old male (Patient-Index) including youngsters with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized close-contacts testing negative for severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Anhui Province, China was prospectively-traced. RESULTS: Since January 23, 2020, we enrolled a cluster of eight youngsters with COVID-19 (median age [range], 22 [16\u201323] years; six males) originating from Patient-Index returning from Wuhan to Hefei on January 19. Patient-Index visited his 16-year-old female cousin in the evening on his return, and met 15 previous classmates in a get-together on January 21. He reported being totally asymptomatic and were described by all his contacts as healthy on January 19-21. His very first symptoms were itchy eyes and fever developed at noon and in the afternoon on January 22, respectively. Seven youngsters (his cousin and six classmates) became infected with COVID-19 after a-few-hour-contact with Patient-Index. None of the patients and contacts had visited Wuhan (except Patient-Index), or had any exposure to wet-markets, wild-animals, or medical-institutes within three months. For affected youngsters, the median incubation-period was 2 days (range, 1\u20134). The median serial-interval was 1 day (range, 0\u20134). Half or more of the eight COVID-19-infected youngsters had fever, cough, sputum production, nasal congestion, and fatigue on admission. All patients had mild conditions. Six patients developed pneumonia (all mild; one bilateral) on admission. As of February 20, four patients were discharged. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2-infection presented strong infectivity during the incubation-period with rapid transmission in this cluster of youngsters outside Wuhan. COVID-19 developed in these youngsters had fast onset and various nonspecific atypical manifestations, and were much milder than in older patients as previously reported.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Lei; Zhang, Xiuwen; Zhang, Xinyue; Wei, Zhijian; Zhang, Lingli; Xu, Jingjing; Liang, Peipei; Xu, Yuanhong; Zhang, Chengyuan; Xu, Aman","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/541408c63b1bd096adc6fefa3354f10f3e0a0f4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194554.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320301171; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283156/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Patient-Index"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Hefei"],"keyphrases":["COVID","cluster of youngsters","infected youngsters","Patient-Index","characteristics of youngsters","affected youngsters","Wuhan","older patients","close-contacts","range","median incubation-period","fever","median age","SARS-CoV","previous classmates","admission","median serial-interval","year-old female cousin","older hospitalized-adults","strong infectivity","outbreak of coronavirus","year-old male","mild conditions","Previous studies","cough","nasal congestion","various nonspecific atypical manifestations","sputum production","fast onset","severe-acute","wild-animals","respiratory-syndrome","negative","infection","rapid transmission","wet-markets","itchy eyes","fatigue","evening","exposure","return","days","medical-institutes","Anhui Province","symptoms","Little information","pneumonia","disease","males","hour-contact","laboratory","China","months","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","get-together","METHODS","Hefei","years","afternoon","places","Half","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

At the same time, this treatment regime leads to significant toxicity, cost, and patient inconvenience. Drug-resistance is linked to CRC stem cells, which are associated with the epidermal-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Thus, to optimally treat CRC, a therapy that can target the cell survival and EMT pathways in both CRC bulk and stem cell populations is critical. We recently identified a novel small molecule NSC30049 (7a) that is effective alone, and in combination potentiates 5-FU-mediated growth inhibition of CRC bulk, FOLFOX-resistant, and CRC stem cells both in vitro and in vivo models. In the present study, we report the synthesis and anti-CRC evaluation of several stable and effective 7a analogs. ASR352 (7b) was identified as one of the equipotent 7a analogs that inhibited the growth of CRC bulk cells, sensitized FOLFOX-resistant cells, and reduced the sphere formation capacity of CRC stem cells. It appears that the complex mechanism of cytotoxicity for 7b includes abrogation of 5-FU-induced the S phase, reduction of the phosphorylation of Chk1 at S317P, S345P and S296P, increased \u03B3H2AX staining, activation of caspase 3/PARP1 cleavage, and enhancement of Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Further 7b-mediated reduced phosphorylation of Chk1 was an indirect effect, since it did not inhibit Chk1 activity in an in vitro kinase assay. Our findings suggest that 7b as a single agent, or in combination with 5-FU can be developed as a therapeutic agent in CRC bulk, FOLFOX-resistant, and CRC stem cell populations for unmanageable metastatic CRC conditions.","publish_time":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Narayan, Satya; Ramisetti, Srinivasa; Jaiswal, Aruna S.; Law, Brian K.; Singh-Pillay, Ashona; Singh, Parvesh; Amin, Shantu; Sharma, Arun K.","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5393fcedd64337c827b2580a6d4e6371fdd26258.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115410.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384048/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S022352341830922X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S022352341830922X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.10.052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["growth of CRC bulk cells","CRC stem cell populations","anti-CRC evaluation","metastatic CRC cure rates","sphere formation capacity of CRC stem cells","FU-mediated growth inhibition of CRC bulk","unmanageable metastatic CRC conditions","sensitized FOLFOX-resistant cells","therapeutic agent","reduced phosphorylation of Chk1","cell survival","Chk1 activity","single agent","combination","analogs","new agent development","EMT pathways","Drug-resistance","high rates","clinical therapeutic plateau","short-term benefits","S296P","S345P","patients","activation of caspase","increased \u03B3H2AX staining","colorectal cancer","significant toxicity","enhancement of Bax","cost","PARP1 cleavage","S317P","synthesis","treatment regime","mesenchymal transition","Abstract","reduction","S phase","oxaliplatin","patient inconvenience","indirect effect","complex mechanism of cytotoxicity","novel small molecule NSC30049","Bcl2 ratio","kinase assay","fluorouracil","abrogation","leucovorin","therapy","present study","time","models","ASR352","findings"],"language":"en"},

To circumvent these problems, recent anti-HIV therapeutic research has focused on improving drug delivery systems through drug delivery targeted specifically to host cells infected with HIV or could potentially get infected with HIV. In this regard, several surface molecules of both viral and host cell origin have been described in recent years, that would enable targeted drug delivery in HIV infection. In the present review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the need for novel drug delivery systems, and the successes and challenges in the identification of novel viral and host-cell molecules for the targeted drug delivery of anti-HIV drugs. Such targeted anti-retroviral drug delivery approaches could pave the way for effective treatment and eradication of HIV from the body.","publish_time":"2014-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramana, Lakshmi Narashimhan; Anand, Appakkudal R.; Sethuraman, Swaminathan; Krishnan, Uma Maheswari","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0ccdee546e2568d5fde7d2f21305d91948cb9bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114626.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365914005835; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365914005835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25119469/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drug interactions","targeted drug delivery of anti-HIV drugs","novel drug delivery systems","long-term drug therapy","HIV infection","targeted anti-retroviral drug delivery approaches","development of drug resistance","eradication of HIV","recent anti-HIV therapeutic research","host-cell molecules","host cell origin","current therapy","host cells","antiretroviral therapy","identification of novel viral","surface molecules","recent years","significant cause of mortality","poor bio-availability","necessity","way","need","lack of access","reduced AIDS-related morbidity","comprehensive overview","challenges","problems","successes","toxicity","Abstract Human Immunodeficiency Virus","effective treatment","tissues","reservoirs","drawbacks","present review","regard","body"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to identify the diagnosis based on clinical variables to differentiate pleural tuberculous exudates from other pleural effusions. We also investigated the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) in the pathogenesis of pleural exudates. Experimental design: The major components in RAS and extracellular matrix metabolism, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, were measured and compared in the patients with transudative (n = 45) and exudative (n = 80) effusions. The exudative effusions were come from the patients with tuberculosis (n = 20), pneumonia (n = 32), and adenocarcinoma (n = 28). Results: Increased ACE and equivalent ACE2 activities, resulting in a significantly increased ACE/ACE2 ratio in exudates, were detected compared to these values in transudates. MMP-9 activity in exudates was significantly higher than that in transudates. The significant correlation between ACE and ACE2 activity that was found in transudates was not found in exudates. Advanced analyses showed significantly increased ACE and MMP-9 activities, and decreased ACE2 activity in tuberculous pleural effusions compared with those in pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions. The results indicate that increased ACE and MMP-9 activities found in the exudates were mainly contributed from a higher level of both enzyme activities in the tuberculous pleural effusions. Conclusion: Interplay between ACE and ACE2, essential functions in the RAS, and abnormal regulation of MMP-9 probably play a pivotal role in the development of exudative effusions. Moreover, the ACE/ACE2 ratio combined with MMP-9 activity in pleural fluid may be potential biomarkers for diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy.","publish_time":"2012-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Wen-Yeh; Kuan, Tang-Ching; Cheng, Kun-Shan; Liao, Yan-Chiou; Chen, Mu-Yuan; Lin, Pei-Heng; Hsu, Yuan-Chang; Huang, Chen-Yi; Hsu, Wei-Hua; Yu, Sheng-Yao; Lin, Chih-Sheng","journal":"Int J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b58422e266ab9339c919119923229d080f27360.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3477689.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.5087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23091417/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS","ACE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tuberculous pleural effusions","Increased ACE","pleural tuberculous exudates","adenocarcinoma effusions","pathogenesis of pleural exudates","ACE2 ratio","equivalent ACE2 activities","decreased ACE2 activity","pleural fluid","development of exudative effusions","enzyme activities","specific pathogenic effusions","RAS","abnormal regulation of MMP","transudates","tuberculous pleurisy","Results","patients","pneumonia","matrix metalloproteinase","angiotensin system","reliable diagnosis","role of renin","pivotal role","higher level","extracellular matrix metabolism","major components","common problem","potential biomarkers","MMPs","essential functions","clinical variables","Objective","Interplay","significant correlation","Experimental design","Advanced analyses","Conclusion","transudative","tuberculosis","study","values"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we identified a syntenin-like gene (MjSyn) from the kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) and detected its function in the antibacterial immunity of shrimp. The full-length MjSyn was 1223 bp with a 963 bp open reading frame that encodes 320 amino acids. The deduced MjSyn proteins contained two atypical PDZ domains (sequence repeat that was first reported in the postsynaptic density protein or PSD-95, DlgA, and ZO-1 protein), an N-terminal domain, and a C-terminal domain. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR results showed that MjSyn was expressed in all tested tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that MjSyn transcripts in the hemocyte, gill, and intestine were signi\uFB01cantly induced at various time points after infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio anguillarum. The knockdown of the expression of MjSyn by RNA interference resulted in a significant decrease in the phagocytic ability and increased bacteria number in vivo of shrimp. Moreover, the expression of MjCnx, a cytoplasma and membrane location lectin chaperone protein, was inhibited in the MjSyn-knocked down shrimp, which indicated a possible calnexin-related way. Thus, the MjSyn participates in the bacterial clearance response of kuruma shrimp, thereby providing new insight into the function of this kind of important adaptor protein.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Qian; Chen, Xiao-wei; Che, Chun-jing; Ding, Ding; Kang, Cui-jie","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84d9a99082245fbe06a8856272138f55f9050947.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111636.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464815000698; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2015.02.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464815000698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25731918/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Syntenin"],"organizations":["MjSyn","PDZ","PCR","Vibrio"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of MjSyn","MjSyn transcripts","full-length MjSyn","deduced MjSyn proteins","antibacterial immunity of shrimp","bacterial clearance response of kuruma shrimp","postsynaptic density protein","multifunctional cytosolic adaptor protein","kind of important adaptor protein","immune response","antibacterial response of invertebrates","Abstract Syntenin","functions of syntenin","membrane location lectin chaperone protein","C-terminal domain","N-terminal domain","PCR results","expression of MjCnx","bp open reading frame","Quantitative real-time PCR analysis","infection","cytoplasma","Staphylococcus aureus","phagocytic ability","atypical PDZ domains","significant decrease","cell migration","various time points","increased bacteria number","RNA interference","new insight","intestine","proliferation","attachment","Vibrio anguillarum","apoptosis","PSD","hemocyte","gill","Marsupenaeus japonicus","DlgA","amino acids","Reverse transcription","possible calnexin-related way","sequence","virus","gene","ZO","tested tissues","knockdown","study"],"language":"en"},

This chapter discusses the epidemiology of toroviruses. ETV was first detected by the isolation of the virus in cell culture. Growth of ETV in cell culture allowed for the characterization of the virus, in terms of its morphology, morphogenesis, protein and nucleic acid composition, and facilitated investigations into its replication strategy. The successful propagation of ETV in cell cultures facilitated the development of a virus-neutralization assay that made it possible to gain an insight into the sero-epidemiology of this virus in various animal populations. Although ETV has been isolated, only once from a horse, there is evidence that antigenically related viruses are widespread in the equine population. The sero-prevalence of ETV-specific antibody as measured by virus neutralization test is very high in the horse population with 35% of randomly collected sera in Germany and 81% in Switzerland being positive.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petric, Martin","journal":"Perspectives in Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d95a039bae090b82ee0691600b4dd00e9df8c60.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(03)09038-4; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168706903090384; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168706903090384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287605/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ETV"],"locations":["Germany","Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["Growth of ETV","virus neutralization test","virus-neutralization assay","unique Berne virus","ETV-specific antibody","successful propagation of ETV","horse population","cell cultures","epidemiology of toroviruses","sero-epidemiology","serendipitous isolation","sero-prevalence","equine population","morphogenesis","development","nucleic acid composition","investigations","protein","morphology","related viruses","evidence","terms","characterization","feces","various animal populations","family Coronaviridae","Publisher Summary","discovery","genus","insight","Germany","Switzerland","replication strategy","chapter","sera"],"language":"en"},

Using poliovirus as a model, we show that a long-range interaction between ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes formed at the ends of the viral genome is necessary for RNA replication. Initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis requires a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. Strikingly, it also requires a cloverleaf-like RNA structure located at the other end of the genome. An RNP complex formed around the 5\u2032 cloverleaf RNA structure interacts with the poly(A) binding protein bound to the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail, thus linking the ends of the viral RNA and effectively circularizing it. Formation of this circular RNP complex is required for initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis. RNA circularization may be a general replication mechanism for positive stranded RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2001-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herold, Jens; Andino, Raul","journal":"Molecular Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbd0507c5921a2ed3f09be6a097a7a7191f8525d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129834.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276501002052; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1097276501002052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","RNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA replication","viral RNA","RNA circularization","cloverleaf RNA structure","replication of positive stranded RNA viruses","Initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis","poly","ends","circular RNP complex","viral genome","tail","general replication mechanism","long-range interaction","ribonucleoprotein","complexes","Formation","factors","binding protein","model","mechanisms","poliovirus"],"language":"en"},

During starvation, cytoplasmic components are randomly sequestered into large double\u2010membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and delivered into the lysosome/vacuole where they are destroyed. Cells are able to modulate autophagy in response to their needs, and under certain circumstances, cargoes, such as aberrant protein aggregates, organelles, and bacteria can be selectively and exclusively incorporated into autophagosomes. As a result, this pathway plays an active role in many physiological processes, and it is induced in numerous pathological situations because of its ability to rapidly eliminate unwanted structures. Despite the advances in understanding the functions of autophagy and the identification of several factors, named Atg proteins that mediate it, the mechanism that leads to autophagosome formation is still a mystery. A major challenge in unveiling this process arises from the fact that the origin and the transport mode of the lipids employed to compose these structures is unknown. This compendium will review and analyze the current data about the possible membrane source(s) with a particular emphasis on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the leading model organism for the study of autophagosome biogenesis, and on mammalian cells.

Viral fusion is driven by specialized proteins which, although specific to each virus, act through a common mechanism, the formation of a complex between two heptad repeat (HR) regions. The HR regions are initially separated in an intermediate termed \u201Cprehairpin\u201D, which bridges the viral and cell membranes, and then fold onto each other to form a 6-helical bundle (6HB), driving the two membranes to fuse. HR-derived peptides can inhibit viral infectivity by binding to the prehairpin intermediate and preventing its transition to the 6HB. The antiviral activity of HR-derived peptides differs considerably among enveloped viruses. For weak inhibitors, potency can be increased by peptide engineering strategies, but sequence-specific optimization is time-consuming. In seeking ways to increase potency without changing the native sequence, we previously reported that attachment to the HR peptide of a cholesterol group (\u201Dcholesterol-tagging\u201D) dramatically increases its antiviral potency, and simultaneously increases its half-life in vivo. We show here that antiviral potency may be increased by combining cholesterol-tagging with dimerization of the HR-derived sequence, using as examples human parainfluenza virus, Nipah virus, and HIV-1. Together, cholesterol-tagging and dimerization may represent strategies to boost HR peptide potency to levels that in some cases may be compatible with in vivo use, possibly contributing to emergency responses to outbreaks of existing or novel viruses.","publish_time":"2012-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pessi, Antonello; Langella, Annunziata; Capit\u00F2, Elena; Ghezzi, Silvia; Vicenzi, Elisa; Poli, Guido; Ketas, Thomas; Mathieu, Cyrille; Cortese, Riccardo; Horvat, Branka; Moscona, Anne; Porotto, Matteo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c916747a33f9b4a986dd0e4a4b853db6814b74f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3353973.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22666328/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HR peptide potency","HR regions","HR-derived sequence","HR-derived peptides","antiviral potency","antiviral activity of HR","cholesterol-tagging","viral infectivity","Viral fusion","Nipah virus","cholesterol group","sequence-specific optimization","native sequence","peptide engineering strategies","prehairpin intermediate","target cell membranes","dimerization","enveloped viruses","HB","examples human parainfluenza virus","novel viruses","obligatory step","outbreaks of existing","complex","binding","emergency responses","common mechanism","heptad repeat","formation","cases","process","specialized proteins","levels","transition","HIV","attachment","therapeutic strategy","helical bundle","weak inhibitors","ways","half-life"],"language":"en"},

De todas formas, las complicaciones son muy frecuentes y pueden llevar a fracaso del injerto a medio y largo plazo y menor supervivencia. De acuerdo con el registro de la International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, las tasas de supervivencia al primer, segundo y quinto a\u00F1o fueron, en 2006, del 74, 65 y 47%, respectivamente. El principal obst\u00E1culo para el \u00E9xito a largo plazo del trasplante de pulm\u00F3n es el rechazo cr\u00F3nico, caracterizado histol\u00F3gicamente como bronquiolitis obliterante, que acontece en cerca de dos terceras partes de los pacientes. Uno de los factores m\u00E1s importantes para el desarrollo de bronquiolitis obliterante, adem\u00E1s del n\u00FAmero de rechazos agudos, es la infecci\u00F3n y la enfermedad por citomegalovirus (CMV). Recientemente, se ha destacado el papel de la infecci\u00F3n por diferentes virus respiratorios como factores de riesgo para el desarrollo de rechazo cr\u00F3nico en receptores de un trasplante de pulm\u00F3n. Las complicaciones infecciosas son una causa frecuente de morbimortalidad en este tipo de pacientes, y la causa de muerte de cerca de la mitad de ellos. La infecci\u00F3n bacteriana es la complicaci\u00F3n m\u00E1s frecuente de un receptor de un trasplante de pulm\u00F3n. Del total, el 35-66% son bacterianas y el 50-85% de los pacientes presentan como m\u00EDnimo un episodio de infecci\u00F3n bacteriana. La segunda causa m\u00E1s frecuente de infecci\u00F3n, despu\u00E9s de la bacteriana, es la infecci\u00F3n por CMV. A pesar de utilizar diferentes estrategias de prevenci\u00F3n, la incidencia sigue siendo elevada, y se sit\u00FAa alrededor del 7% el primer a\u00F1o postrasplante. Es el \u00FAnico tipo de trasplante de \u00F3rgano s\u00F3lido en el cual la etiolog\u00EDa m\u00E1s frecuente de la infecci\u00F3n f\u00FAngica es Aspergillus spp., a diferencia del resto, en que t\u00EDpicamente se deben a Candida spp. La incidencia de aspergilosis invasora se cifra en alrededor del 4%. Lung transplantation is now considered an established therapeutic option for patients with severe respiratory failure. Nevertheless, complications are frequent and can lead to intermediate- or long-term graft dysfunction and decreased survival. According to the registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, survival rates in these patients at one, two, and five years are 74%, 65%, and 47%, respectively. The main obstacle to long-term success of lung transplantation, however, is chronic rejection, which is characterized histologically as bronchiolitis obliterans and occurs in up to two-thirds of patients. One of the most important risk factors for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans, in addition to the number of previous acute rejection episodes and the incidence of persistent rejection, is cytomegalovirus infection and disease. Moreover, recent evidence has indicated a role for respiratory viruses as risk factors for the development of chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients. Infectious complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients and are the cause of death in nearly half of them. Bacterial infection is the most frequent infectious complication in lung transplant patients. Among the total of infections, 35%-66% are bacterial and 50%-85% of patients present at least one episode. CMV is the second most frequent cause of infectious complications following lung transplantation. Despite the use of various preventive strategies, the risk of developing CMV disease in lung transplant recipients is over 5% during the first year. This is the only type of solid organ transplant in which the etiology of fungal infection is characteristically Aspergillus spp., in contrast to others in which infection by Candida spp. is most common. The incidence of invasive aspergillosis is about 4%.","publish_time":"2007-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gavald\u00E0, Joan; Rom\u00E1n, Antonio","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16d06d8c5fb7aaadd4540043097e830dc952f040.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X07743732; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X07743732","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["De"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infecci\u00F3n y","lung transplant patients","infecci\u00F3n bacteriana es","pulm\u00F3n es","infecci\u00F3n por CMV","lung transplant recipients","son bacterianas y","y se sit\u00FAa alrededor","infecci\u00F3n f\u00FAngica es Aspergillus","long-term success of lung transplantation","medio y largo plazo y menor supervivencia","thirds of patients","pulm\u00F3n se considera","frequent cause of infectious complications","en que t\u00EDpicamente se deben","que acontece en cerca","\u00F3rgano s\u00F3lido en","rechazo cr\u00F3nico en receptores","etiolog\u00EDa m\u00E1s frecuente","complicaci\u00F3n m\u00E1s frecuente","segunda causa m\u00E1s frecuente","Bacterial infection","aspergilosis invasora se cifra en alrededor","los factores m\u00E1s importantes para","segundo y quinto a\u00F1o fueron","morbimortalidad en este tipo","infecci\u00F3n por diferentes virus respiratorios como factores","development of chronic rejection","frequent infectious complication","frequent cause of morbidity","complicaciones son muy frecuentes y pueden llevar","riesgo para","risk of developing CMV disease","cytomegalovirus infection","Las complicaciones infecciosas son una causa frecuente","los pacientes presentan como m\u00EDnimo","se ha destacado","incidence of persistent rejection","desarrollo","tratamiento v\u00E1lido para","principal obst\u00E1culo para","Heart","important risk factors","International Society","Candida","development of bronchiolitis obliterans","etiology of fungal infection","cause of death","caracterizado histol\u00F3gicamente como bronquiolitis obliterante","type of solid organ transplant","enfermedad por citomegalovirus","primer a\u00F1o postrasplante","number of previous acute rejection episodes","buen n\u00FAmero","\u00FAnico tipo","respiratory viruses","survival rates","decreased survival","total of infections","utilizar diferentes estrategias","long-term graft dysfunction","severe respiratory failure","incidence of invasive aspergillosis","incidencia sigue siendo elevada","fracaso","injerto","prevenci\u00F3n","papel","dos terceras partes","resto","diferencia","cual","episodio","rechazos agudos","addition","role","adem\u00E1s","established therapeutic option","\u00E9xito","tasas","despu\u00E9s","Uno","muerte","insuficiencia respiratoria grave","use of various preventive strategies","todas formas","main obstacle","pesar","Recientemente","registro","mortality","mitad","registry","Actualmente","recent evidence","ellos","acuerdo","contrast","respectivamente","years"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we summarize the research efforts of the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program (IDCRP) related to ARIs. METHODS: The ARI Research Area of the IDCRP was established in response to the 2009 emergence of pandemic influenza A/H1N1. That year, IDCRP investigators deployed the ARI Consortium Natural History Study (ARIC NHS), a multi-centered, longitudinal observational study to assess etiology, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the U.S. military. The success of this initial effort spurred implementation of several new initiatives. These include the FluPlasma trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy of hyperimmune anti-influenza plasma for the treatment of severe influenza; the self-administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (SNIF) trial, which assessed the immunogenicity and acceptance of a self-administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine in military personnel; the Study to Address Threats of ARI in Congregate Military Populations (ATARI), a prospective study of ILI transmission, etiology and epidemiology in recruits; and the Flu Breath Test (FBT) study, a preliminary study of exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOC) in influenza patients. In addition, the InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) survey, a daily diary to measure influenza symptoms during clinical trials, was developed. Lastly, the Pragmatic Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the DoD (PAIVED) study, a two-year randomized trial designed to compare the effectiveness of the three types of licensed vaccines, launched in Fall 2018. RESULTS: The on-going ARIC NHS has enrolled over 2000 ILI and SARI cases since its inception, providing data on burden and clinical manifestations of ARI in military personnel and their families. The FluPlasma 2 trial concluded subject enrollment in 2018. Preliminary results from ATARI study show a high frequency of respiratory viruses circulating during the first two weeks of recruit training. Based on assessment of FLU-PRO responses, which were found to be reliable and reproducible, the survey may be a useful tool in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. The Flu Breath Study will complete enrollment in 2019. Findings from PAIVED are intended to provide evidence needed for assessing influenza vaccination policy in the military. CONCLUSIONS: The ARI burden in the armed services remains significant every year and the threat is dynamic given emergent and evolving threats, such as influenzas. With strong successes to date, future initiatives of the ARI Research Area will focus on interventional studies, ARI transmission dynamics in congregate military settings, and determinants of risk of pandemic influenza and other emergent respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2019-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coles, Christian; Millar, Eugene V; Burgess, Timothy; Ottolini, Martin G","journal":"Mil Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65adb5bb3dfdd3467ab61494da1c6c9689004802.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6886571.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usz174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31778194/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program","ARI Research Area","IDCRP","ARI Consortium Natural History Study (ARIC NHS","ARIC NHS","SARI","FluPlasma","Flu Breath Study"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["influenza symptoms","influenza patients","clinical characteristics of influenza","ATARI study","Threats of ARI","ARI burden","treatment of severe influenza","military personnel","Flu Breath Study","emergence of pandemic influenza","clinical manifestations of ARI","ARI Research Area","influenza vaccination policy","self-administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine","ARI Consortium Natural History Study","Pragmatic Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness","prospective study of ILI transmission","ARI transmission dynamics","longitudinal observational study","clinical trials","congregate military settings","Congregate Military Populations","efficacy of hyperimmune anti-influenza plasma","FLU-PRO","assessment of FLU","FluPlasma trial","emergent respiratory viruses","preliminary study of exhaled volatile organic compounds","severe acute respiratory infections","research efforts","Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program","Flu Breath Test","etiology","epidemiology","IDCRP investigators","survey","high frequency of respiratory viruses","Preliminary results","PAIVED","two-year randomized trial","on-going ARIC NHS","interventional studies","future initiatives","evolving threats","epidemiological studies","new initiatives","SARI cases","PRO responses","subject enrollment","substantial annual morbidity","VOC","recruits","determinants of risk","illness","FBT","useful tool","daily diary","implementation","data","inception","date","armed services","Outcome","SNIF","DoD","initial effort","strong successes","acceptance","evidence","immunogenicity","INTRODUCTION","operational readiness","types of licensed vaccines","H1N1","METHODS","families","weeks of recruit training","Fall","influenzas","ARIs","addition","CONCLUSIONS","Findings"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics, treatment and outcome of children diagnosed with community-acquired MP pneumonia (CAMP) in a tertiary hospital in Valencia, Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical records of children \u003C14 years with CAMP were retrospectively reviewed from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients with radiological evidence of pneumonia and microbiological confirmation of MP (PCR from nasopharyngeal swab and/or serum specific IgM) were considered CAMP. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty two children were diagnosed with CAMP; median age 6 years (IQR: 4-9). The positive MP test rate among children with CAP progressively increased with age as did the empirical use of macrolides. There were two peaks of cases in 2011 and in 2015, being July, August, November and December the seasons with the higher number of cases. The most frequent radiological pattern was segmental infiltrate (62.3%) and 22 (13.6%) children had pleural effusion. It was noteworthy the mild symptomatology and low levels of inflammatory parameters that children with CAMP had. A macrolide was empirically initiated in 68.5% of cases. Hospital admission rate was inversely proportional to patient\u0027s age. CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, older, less symptomatic patients and with lower inflammatory parameters had the greatest rate of MP infection among children with CAP and thus they could benefit of empiric macrolide therapy. Therefore, knowing the epidemiology of a geographical area may be important for the management of CAP in children.","publish_time":"2019-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguilera-Alonso, David; L\u00F3pez Ruiz, Roc\u00EDo; Centeno Rubiano, Jose; Morell Garc\u00EDa, Marta; Valero Garc\u00EDa, Isabel; Ocete Moch\u00F3n, Mar\u00EDa Dolores; Montesinos Sanchis, Elena","journal":"An Pediatr (Barc)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daaa19974be8ccb2f24ba20f142db04d3188d882.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185449.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2018.07.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Valencia","Spain"],"keyphrases":["outcome of children","CAMP","MP pneumonia","Medical records of children","greatest rate of MP infection","positive MP test rate","management of CAP","microbiological confirmation of MP","radiological evidence of pneumonia","Hospital admission rate","median age","years","patient\u0027s age","peaks of cases","lower inflammatory parameters","higher number of cases","low levels of inflammatory parameters","symptomatic patients","tertiary hospital","frequent radiological pattern","empiric macrolide therapy","common etiological agents of community","nasopharyngeal swab","mild symptomatology","PCR","treatment","serum specific IgM","epidemiological characteristics","study","segmental infiltrate","OBJECTIVES","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","METHODS","geographical area","INTRODUCTION","MATERIAL","Valencia","Spain","seasons","IQR","empirical use of macrolides","epidemiology","pleural effusion","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV pandemic infected over 8,500 individuals, claimed over 800 lives and cost billions of dollars in economic loss worldwide, there still are no clinically approved antiviral drugs, vaccines or monoclonal antibody therapies to treat SARS-CoV infections. The recent emergence of the deadly human coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a sobering reminder that new and deadly coronaviruses can emerge at any time with the potential to become pandemics. Therefore, the continued development of therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures to potentially deadly coronaviruses is warranted. The coronaviral proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), are attractive antiviral drug targets because they are essential for coronaviral replication. Although the primary function of PLpro and 3CLpro are to process the viral polyprotein in a coordinated manner, PLpro has the additional function of stripping ubiquitin and ISG15 from host-cell proteins to aid coronaviruses in their evasion of the host innate immune responses. Therefore, targeting PLpro with antiviral drugs may have an advantage in not only inhibiting viral replication but also inhibiting the dysregulation of signaling cascades in infected cells that may lead to cell death in surrounding, uninfected cells. This review provides an up-to-date discussion on the SARS-CoV papain-like protease including a brief overview of the SARS-CoV genome and replication followed by a more in-depth discussion on the structure and catalytic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLpro, the multiple cellular functions of SARS-CoV PLpro, the inhibition of SARS-CoV PLpro by small molecule inhibitors, and the prospect of inhibiting papain-like protease from other coronaviruses.

Type I interferons (IFNs) is an important part of the immune system in the defense against viral infection. To investigate the function of type I IFNs upon viral infection in bats, the nucleic acid, and amino acid sequences of Egyptian Rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) IFN-\u03B1 and -\u03B2 were characterized. Sequence data indicated that bat IFN-\u03B1 consists of 562-bp encoded 187-aa, and IFN-\u03B2 consisted of 558-bp encoded 186-aa. Phylogenetic analysis of the overall identity of IFN-\u03B2 shared the highest sequence homology with pig IFN-\u03B2 in both nucleotide and amino acid level. Stimulation of bat primary kidney cells (BPKCs) and bat lung cell lines, Tb-1 Lu, with polyinosinic\u2013polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) or exogenous bat type I IFNs resulted in increased type I IFNs mRNA expression in BPKCs, but not in Tb-1 Lu. Characterization of the bat IFN-\u03B1 and -\u03B2 genes allows understanding of the immune responses upon stimulation in different tissues, thus providing practical strategies for control and treatment of clinically important diseases.

The survey was conducted in three waves: prior to the announcement of the first case of coronavirus (2-3 March), immediately after that announcement (5-6 March), and a few days later (9-10 March). Results: We showed that women estimated the chances of being infected as significantly higher (M = 4.52, SD = 2.079; t = 2.387; p = 0.018; Cohen\u0027s d = 0.393) than men (M = 3.71, SD = 2.042). The phenomenon of unrealistic optimism was observed especially in men (as compared to other male participants) as it appeared in all three measures (M (you) = 3.95 vs. M (other male student) = 4.63; M = 3.71 vs. M = 4.68, and M = 4.46 vs. M = 5.38 in phase one, two, and three, respectively; p 0.006 for all comparison), but also in women in the last two measures (M(you) = 4.55 vs. M (other female student) = 4.95, and M = 4.99 vs. M = 5.38 in phase 2 and 3, respectively; p 0.012 for both comparisons). Conclusions: The study revealed a fairly general occurrence of unrealistic optimism, which was mainly observed in men as it appeared in all three measures, but also in women in the last two measures. This result is important for health experts who are responsible for making people comply with regulations concerning social distancing, putting masks on to stop infection, and staying at home. It is possible that unrealistically optimistic people will behave much less in line with the aforementioned recommendations, causing coronavirus to spread widely.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dolinski, Dariusz; Dolinska, Barbara; Zmaczynska-Witek, Barbara; Banach, Maciej; Kulesza, Wojciech","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414182/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["women","measures","coronavirus infection","level of unrealistic optimism","phenomenon of unrealistic optimism","general occurrence of unrealistic optimism","occurrence of so-called unrealistic optimism","case of coronavirus","imminent coronavirus pandemic","optimistic people","Survey studies","average student","SD","announcement","female student","male participants","phase","results of numerous empirical studies","regulations","health experts","masks","social distancing","risk","subjective way","study","Objective","sex","line","aforementioned recommendations","situation","Cohen\u0027s d","chances","waves","Methods","likelihood","disease","Conclusions","class","home","comparisons","days"],"language":"en"},

Secondly, the indigenous bat population is known to carry a virus genetically related to rabies virus, the European bat lyssavirus (EBLV). Molecular characterization of this virus has further characterized it as being EBLV type 2, genetically distinct from a similar virus that has caused several human deaths across Europe. Finally, a lack of awareness of the threat of rabies and related viruses to travelers visiting endemic areas also constitutes a re-introduction threat to the UK population. This review will address the most recent cases of lyssavirus infection, in both humans and animals, either contracted within the UK or from abroad. We highlight the current diagnostic necessity for testing indigenous and foreign cases and comment on current UK government policy in light of a European call to harmonise rabies legislation across Europe.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banyard, Ashley C.; Hartley, Matt; Fooks, Anthony R.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc1e6466e56a99115c4ffcb9e921bf0261cb7ec0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126864.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210001917; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210001917; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20558215/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","EBLV"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["threat of rabies","similar virus","threat of re-introduction of rabies virus","UK population","rabies legislation","re-introduction threat","current UK government policy","European bat lyssavirus","indigenous bat population","foreign cases","recent cases of lyssavirus infection","related viruses","EBLV type","current diagnostic necessity","importation of live animals","comment","endemic areas","travelers","light","United Kingdom","human deaths","humans","lack of awareness","levels","review","regulations","place","Molecular characterization","country"],"language":"en"},

The former strategy is non-compatible for characterizing properties innate to RNA strands such as secondary structure, RNA-RNA interactions, and also for nanopore direct RNA sequencing involving the sequencing of native RNA strands. The latter strategy, ultracentrifugation, causes loss in genomic information due to its inability to retrieve unassembled viral RNA. We developed a novel nucleic acid manipulation technique involving the capture of whole viral native RNA genomes for downstream RNA assays using hybridization baits in solution to circumvent these problems. This technique involves hybridization of biotinylated baits at 500 nucleotides (nt) intervals, stringent washes and release of free native RNA strands using DNase I treatment, with a turnaround time of about 6 h 15 min. Proof of concept was primarily done using RT-qPCR with dengue virus infected Huh-7 cells. We report that this protocol was able to purify viral RNA (561-791 fold). We also describe a successful application of our capture-based purification method to direct RNA sequencing, with a 77.47% of reads mapping to the target viral genome. We observed a reduction in human host RNA background by 1580 fold, a 99.91% recovery of viral genome with at least 15x coverage, and a mean coverage across the genome of 120x. This report is, to the best of our knowledge, the first description of a capture-based purification method for whole viral RNA genomes. The fundamental advantages of using our capture-based purification method makes it a superior alternative to conventional viral purification methods and would potentially pave a new path for the direct characterization and sequencing of native RNA molecules.","publish_time":"2018-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Chih Shen Cedric; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Wan, Yue; Sessions, October Michael; de Sessions, Paola Florez","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c6f59325d77d7b1fc4263fc6992589a8d88db9d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/410282","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA-RNA interactions","manipulation of viral RNA","viral RNA genomes","unassembled viral RNA","viral native RNA genomes","sequencing of native RNA strands","sequencing of native RNA molecules","downstream RNA assays","nanopore direct RNA sequencing","human host RNA background","release of free native RNA strands","target viral genome","recovery of viral genome","conventional viral purification methods","capture-based purification method","isopycnic gradients of viral particles","direct characterization","ultracentrifugation","hybridization baits","fold","strategy","report","hybridization of biotinylated baits","targeted characterization","mean coverage","novel nucleic acid manipulation technique","superior alternative","stringent washes","nucleotides","characterizing properties","treatment","DNase","amplification","secondary structure","intervals","solution","inability","dengue virus","genomic information","loss","Current technologies","new path","reduction","description","RT-qPCR","turnaround time","successful application","reads","protocol","Proof of concept","fundamental advantages","knowledge","cells","best","problems"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, induction of the host tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxgenase-1 (IDO1), by interferon gamma (IFN\u03B3) is one of the primary protective responses against chlamydial infection. However, despite the presence of a robust IFN\u03B3 response, active and replicating C. trachomatis can be detected in cervical secretions of women. We hypothesized that a primary C. trachomatis infection may evade the IFN\u03B3 response, and that the protective effect of this cytokine results from its activation of tryptophan catabolism in bystander cells. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel method to separate a pool of cells exposed to C. trachomatis into pure populations of live infected and bystander cells and applied this technique to distinguish between the effects of IFN\u03B3 on infected and bystander cells. Our findings revealed that the protective induction of IDO1 is suppressed specifically within primary infected cells because Chlamydia attenuates the nuclear import of activated STAT1 following IFN\u03B3 exposure, without affecting STAT1 levels or phosphorylation. Critically, the IFN\u03B3-mediated induction of IDO1 activity is unhindered in bystander cells. Therefore, the IDO1-mediated tryptophan catabolism is functional in these cells, transforming these bystander cells into inhospitable hosts for a secondary C. trachomatis infection.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ibana, Joyce A.; Sherchand, Shardulendra P.; Fontanilla, Francis L.; Nagamatsu, Takeshi; Schust, Danny J.; Quayle, Alison J.; Aiyar, Ashok","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1684d4ad73d5982451ae73e97542c2559c04038.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5981614.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-26765-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29855501/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bystander cells","primary infected cells","pool of cells","trachomatis infection","Chlamydia trachomatis","IFN\u03B3 exposure","effects of IFN\u03B3","protective induction of IDO1","IFN\u03B3-mediated induction of IDO1 activity","IDO1-mediated tryptophan catabolism","robust IFN\u03B3 response","tryptophan auxotroph","activation of tryptophan catabolism","primary protective responses","protective effect","chlamydial infection","host tryptophan catabolizing enzyme","pure populations of live infected","STAT1 levels","nuclear import of activated STAT1","cytokine results","inhospitable hosts","indoleamine","intracellular bacterial pathogen","novel method","dioxgenase","presence","interferon gamma","technique","cervical secretions of women","hypothesis","phosphorylation","findings"],"language":"en"},

A larger, second wave of cases was anticipated the following autumn. To reduce a potential surge of health system utilization without denying needed care, we enlisted the input of experts from medicine, public health, nursing, information technology, and other disciplines to design, test, and deploy clinical algorithms to help minimally trained health care workers and laypeople make informed decisions about care-seeking for influenza-like illness. The product of this collaboration, named Strategy for Off-Site Rapid Triage (SORT) was disseminated in 2 forms. Static algorithms, posted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u0027s Web site, offered guidance to clinicians and telephone call centers on how to manage adults and children with influenza-like illness. In addition, 2 interactive Web sites, http://www.Flu.gov and http://www.H1N1ResponseCenter.com, were created to help adults self-assess their condition and make an informed decision about their need for treatment. Although SORT was anchored in a previously validated clinical decision rule, incorporated the input of expert clinicians, and was subject to small-scale formative evaluations during rapid standup, prospective evaluation is lacking. If its utility and safety are confirmed, SORT may prove to be a useful tool to blunt health system surge and rapidly collect epidemiologic data on future disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kellermann, Arthur L.; Isakov, Alexander P.; Parker, Ruth; Handrigan, Michael T.; Foldy, Seth","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcd5267139b5393bd02e8ca5c760bc5aec30c274.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115325.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2010.04.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064410003549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20605260/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064410003549","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Off-Site Rapid Triage","Centers for Disease Control"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health system surge","SORT","public health","trained health care workers","potential surge of health system utilization","needed care","Centers","clinical algorithms","H1N1 influenza","illness","input of expert clinicians","rapid standup","informed decisions","Disease Control","input of experts","validated clinical decision rule","Static algorithms","adults self-","Prevention\u0027s Web site","Off-Site Rapid Triage","future disease outbreaks","interactive Web sites","laypeople","epidemiologic data","small-scale formative evaluations","visits","emergency departments","Strategy","guidance","New York City","information technology","nursing","medicine","prospective evaluation","useful tool","disciplines","design","collaboration","test","condition","spring","year","wave of cases","communities","addition","sudden emergence","treatment","telephone","children","following autumn","product","utility"],"language":"en"},

Anyplex\u2122 II RV16 [RV16] was designed for simultaneous detection of 16 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR coupled with TOCE\u2122 technology. Objectives To compare the performance of RV16 with those of culture and Seeplex\u00AE RV15 ACE [RV15] by determining their sensitivity and specificity. Study design Seven hundred and thirty respiratory samples were tested by modified shell vial culture method, RV16, and RV15. For molecular tests, automated nucleic acid extraction and liquid handling system using MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton, USA) was adopted to maximize the workflow and accuracy. Performance of each assay was determined against a composite reference standard. Results Two hundred and one samples (28%) out of 730 samples were positive by culture, while additional 281 (39%) were positive by RV16 or RV15. Sensitivities of RV16, RV15, and culture for virus tested were as follows: 100/93/63% for influenza A, 90/80/69% for influenza B, 98/94/63% for RSV, 98/52/23% for adenovirus, and 100/75/46% for PIV. For viruses not covered by culture, sensitivities of RV16 and RV15 were as follows: 99/81% for rhinovirus, 92/100% for coronavirus OC43, 100/56% for coronavirus 229E/NL63, 92/88% for metapneumovirus, 100/62% for bocavirus, and 91/91% for enterovirus. Overall, the specificities of culture, RV16, and RV15 (Seegene) were 100/99.9/99.9%. Conclusions RV16 assay was superior to culture method and RV15 and will be a promising tool for patient management and public health epidemiology.","publish_time":"2013-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Chi Hyun; Chulten, Bayarjavkhlan; Lee, Chang Kyu; Nam, Myung Hyun; Yoon, Soo Young; Lim, Chae Seung; Cho, Yunjung; Kim, Young Kee","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb8f2f72f6a73f6bc8e3c3109b68edb71a72f75b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108272.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23743345/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2013.04.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653213001546; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653213001546","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MICROLAB Nimbus IVD","PIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sensitivities of RV16","performance of RV16","RV15 ACE","specificities of culture","Conclusions RV16 assay","respiratory samples","modified shell vial culture method","accurate detection of respiratory viruses","molecular tests","simultaneous detection","coronavirus OC43","influenza B","Abstract Background Various kinds of commercial molecular systems","liquid handling system","automated nucleic acid extraction","MICROLAB Nimbus IVD","patient management","promising tool","multiplex PCR","public health epidemiology","Hamilton","Seeplex","USA","TOCE","technology","NL63","composite reference standard","Study design","bocavirus","metapneumovirus","rhinovirus","sensitivity","Objectives","Seegene","Anyplex","workflow","accuracy","enterovirus","specificity","Results","RSV","adenovirus","PIV"],"language":"en"},

Population bottlenecks are frequent during the life cycle of viruses and can reduce viral populations transiently to very few individuals. Viruses have to confront several types of constraints that can be divided in basal, cell-dependent, and organism-dependent constraints. Viruses overcome them exploiting a number of molecular mechanisms, with an important contribution of population numbers and genome variation. The adaptive potential of viruses is reflected in modifications of cell tropism and host range, escape to components of the host immune response, and capacity to alternate among different host species, among other phenotypic changes. Despite a fitness cost of most mutations required to overcome a selective constraint, viruses can find evolutionary pathways that ensure their survival in equilibrium with their hosts.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Virus as Populations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e529078dfa31f5985e2dcc4b1095c2607b720fb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150142.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128008379000046; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128008379000046","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host range","different host species","life cycle of viruses","adaptive potential of viruses","host immune response","Abstract Viral population numbers","cell-dependent","Population bottlenecks","important contribution of population numbers","organism-dependent constraints","viral populations","types of constraints","modifications of cell tropism","capacity","evolutionary pathways","components","selective constraint","genome variation","mutations","survival","number of molecular mechanisms","phenotypic changes","equilibrium","fitness cost","hosts","individuals"],"language":"en"},

APN participates in tumor cell expansion and motility, and is a target for cancer therapies. Small drugs that bind to the APN active site inhibit catalysis and suppress tumor growth. APN is also a major cell entry receptor for coronavirus, which binds to a region distant from the active site. Three crystal structures that we determined of human and pig APN ectodomains defined the dynamic conformation of the protein. These structures offered snapshots of closed, intermediate and open APN, which represent distinct functional states. Coronavirus envelope proteins specifically recognized the open APN form, prevented ectodomain progression to the closed form and substrate hydrolysis. In addition, drugs that bind the active site inhibited both coronavirus binding to cell surface APN and infection; the drugs probably hindered APN transition to the virus-specific open form. We conclude that allosteric inhibition of APN functions occurs by ligand suppression of ectodomain motions necessary for catalysis and virus cell entry, as validated by locking APN with disulfides. Blocking APN dynamics can thus be a valuable approach to development of drugs that target this ectoenzyme.","publish_time":"2017-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santiago, C\u00E9sar; Mudgal, Gaurav; Reguera, Juan; Recacha, Rosario; Albrecht, S\u00E9bastien; Enjuanes, Luis; Casasnovas, Jos\u00E9 M.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/306840cf9baaaf3a2e493a39f3ebd67529b8cb2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5385526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28393915/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell surface APN","APN dynamics","open APN form","APN active site","hindered APN transition","pig APN ectodomains","allosteric inhibition of APN functions","virus cell entry","numerous cell functions","tumor cell expansion","Cell surface aminopeptidase N","major cell entry receptor","closed form","development of drugs","Small drugs","virus-specific open form","catalysis","coronavirus binding","Coronavirus envelope proteins","target","ectodomain progression","snapshots of closed","tumor growth","crystal structures","membrane-bound ectoenzyme","ligand suppression of ectodomain motions necessary","infection","peptides","dynamic conformation","valuable approach","motility","distinct functional states","substrate hydrolysis","region distant","cancer therapies","addition","disulfides"],"language":"en"},

The biggest challenge is the extraction of relevant information from the huge sequence datasets generated for metagenomics studies. Although a plethora of tools are available, data analysis is still a bottleneck. RESULTS: To overcome the bottleneck of data analysis, we developed an automated computational workflow called RIEMS \u2013 Reliable Information Extraction from Metagenomic Sequence datasets. RIEMS assigns every individual read sequence within a dataset taxonomically by cascading different sequence analyses with decreasing stringency of the assignments using various software applications. After completion of the analyses, the results are summarised in a clearly structured result protocol organised taxonomically. The high accuracy and performance of RIEMS analyses were proven in comparison with other tools for metagenomics data analysis using simulated sequencing read datasets. CONCLUSIONS: RIEMS has the potential to fill the gap that still exists with regard to data analysis for metagenomics studies. The usefulness and power of RIEMS for the analysis of genuine sequencing datasets was demonstrated with an early version of RIEMS in 2011 when it was used to detect the orthobunyavirus sequences leading to the discovery of Schmallenberg virus.

Hence, the development of efficient drug treatments for the biological effects of SARS is highly needed. We have previously shown that quantum dots (QDs)-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide is sensitive to the specific recognition of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein. In this study, we found that a designed biochip could analyze inhibitors of the SARS-CoV N protein using nanoparticle-based RNA oligonucleotide.

To investigate the prevalence of nephropathogenic IB in China, eighty IBV isolates from different provinces during 2008-2009 were identified by dwarf embryo test and RT-PCR. RESULTS: The strains were mostly isolated in winter and spring with a wide age range of IB outbreaks, from 4 to 69 days. By the virus recovery trials, 70/80 of the strains resulted in the deaths or distresses of birds from nephritis. To learn more about the molecular evolutionary characteristics of the circulating field strains, the coding region of major spike 1 (S1) protein gene of these strains was RT-PCR amplified and sequenced. Compared to the published representative strains, nucleotides and amino acids sequence analysis indicated that the S1 genes of these strains and the reference strains displayed homologies ranging from 75.1% to 99.8% and from 73.1% to 99.8% respectively. S1 protein of the major pandemic strains contained 540 or 542 amino acids with the cleavage site of HRRRR or RRFRR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that recent field isolates of IBV in China were mostly belonged to A2-branch (QXIBV-branch) and HN08-branch, only one isolate was belonged to Gray-branch and M41-branch respectively. Most of the 80 strains showed evolutionarily distant from vaccine strains.

Natural initial enteric FCoV infection may remain subclinical, or result in mild enteric signs or the development of FIP; cats may also carry the virus systemically with no adverse effect. This study screened mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), the presumed first site of FCoV spread from the intestine regardless of viraemia, for changes in the transcription of a panel of innate immune response mediators in response to systemic FCoV infection and with FIP, aiming to identify key pathways triggered by FCoV. Cats with and without FIP, the latter with and without FCoV infection in the MLN, were compared. Higher expression levels in FIP were found for toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2, 4 and 8. These are part of the first line of defence and suggest a response to both viral structural proteins and viral nucleic acid. Expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-15, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, CXCL10, CCL8, interferon (IFN)-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2 and IFN-\u03B3, was higher in cats with FIP, consistent with inflammatory pathway activation. Expression of genes encoding transcription factors STAT1 and 2, regulating signalling pathways, particularly of the interferons, was also higher. Among cats without FIP, there were few differences between virus-positive and virus-negative MLNs; however, TLR9 and STAT2 expression were higher with infection, suggesting a direct viral effect. The study provides evidence for TLR involvement in the response to FCoV. This could open up new avenues for therapeutic approaches.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malbon, A.

This infection spreads mainly through direct contact with Fl\u00FCgge micro droplets or core droplets that remain suspended as aerosol. Moreover, it has been reported that infected subjects, both with and without clinical signs of COVID-19, can transmit the virus. Since the infection typically enters through mouth, nose, and eyes, dentistry is one of the medical practices at highest risk of infection due to the frequent production of aerosol and the constant presence of saliva. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that only emergency/urgent procedures should be performed during the coronavirus outbreak. Considering the virus\u0027 route of transmission, a specific protocol should be applied to reduce the risk of infection in addition to measures that prevent the spread of infection from a patient to another person or medical tools and equipment (cross-infection). This protocol should be implemented by modifying both patient management and clinical practice, introducing particular devices and organizational practices. This paper aims to discuss and suggest the most appropriate procedures in every aspect of dental practice to reduce infection risk.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lo Giudice, Roberto","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354081/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093067","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["infection risk","spread of infection","cross-infection","highest risk of infection","novel coronavirus","coronavirus outbreak","clinical practice","medical practices","etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease","clinical signs of COVID","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","core droplets","medical tools","organizational practices","patient management","appropriate procedures","urgent procedures","specific protocol","Fl\u00FCgge micro droplets","aspect of dental practice","frequent production of aerosol","particular devices","direct contact","equipment","person","measures","SARS-CoV","constant presence of saliva","Wuhan","route of transmission","China","dentistry","nose","addition","eyes","mouth","World Health Organization","emergency","infected subjects","paper"],"language":"en"},

It is hypothesized that one major factor is overlooked: pollen count. Pollen are documented to invoke strong immune responses and might create an environmental factor that makes it more difficult for flu-like viruses to survive outside a host. This Dutch study confirms that there is a (highly) significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults, and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence, as measured by prescribed medication revenues, and weekly flu consults. This supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu-like epidemics. If seasonality will be observed during the covid-19 spread as well, it is not unlikely that pollen play a role.","publish_time":"2020-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoogeveen, Martijn J.","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4513491494e0513068bbbcce601f92efec1d8dbb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/872c33b4e4cbaa30d897de18be97a5e91a693064.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162772.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720320568; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720320568?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138543","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["seasonality of flu","pollen count","weekly flu consults","account seasonality","medical flu consults","significant inverse correlation","indirect factor","major factor","Covid","current environmental factors","weekly changes","current models","hay fever incidence","prescribed medication revenues","climate differences","countries","moderate climates","pandemic","strong immune responses","powerful explanation","viruses","uncertainty","role","idea","epidemics","Dutch study","host"],"language":"en"},

A SYBR Green I-based quantitative RT-PCR for detection of RRV was developed targeting the E2 gene, with a detection limit of 100 RNA copies/reaction. The specificity was confirmed with closely related Alphaviruses and Flaviviruses. The assay was applied to study the vector competence of Indian Aedes aegypti for RRV, which revealed 100% infection and dissemination rate with 75% transmission rate. Viral RNA was found in saliva as early as 3day post infection (dpi). Further application of the assay in antiviral drug evaluation revealed the superior in vitro activity of ribavirin compared to chloroquine in Vero cells. Successful demonstration of this assay to detect RRV in low titre mosquito samples makes it a sensitive tool in vector surveillance. This study also showed that Indian Ae. aegypti are well competent to transmit RRV highlighting the risk of its introduction to na\u00EFve territories across continents. Further validation of this assay, revealed its utility in screening of potential antivirals against RRV.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dash, Paban Kumar; Agarwal, Ankita; Sharma, Shashi; Saha, Amrita; Joshi, Gaurav; Gopalan, Natarajan; Sukumaran, Devanathan; Parida, Man Mohan","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/944a7d4bba94961a24ad725aca36b399884a3b62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119768.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27105737/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.04.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416301288; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416301288","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RRV","SYBR Green"],"locations":["Oceania"],"keyphrases":["detection of RRV","assay","study","detection limit","vector competence of Indian Aedes aegypti","vector surveillance","activity of antiviral compounds","molecular detection system","activity of ribavirin","dissemination rate","RNA copies","transmission rate","Viral RNA","antiviral drug evaluation","day post infection","low titre mosquito samples","sensitive tool","introduction","risk","quantitative RT-PCR","screening of potential antivirals","Abstract Ross River virus","na\u00EFve territories","saliva","chloroquine","utility","E2 gene","emerging Alphavirus","related Alphaviruses","Vero cells","continents","SYBR Green","reaction","emergence","application","Successful demonstration","specificity","Flaviviruses","parts of Oceania","mind","validation"],"language":"en"},

The inactivation of these viruses was then assessed to determine which of the tested conditions provided the greatest reduction in virus infectivity. An inactivation of at least two orders of magnitude for \u03C6X174, MS2 and MNV-1 was achieved with an ozone exposure of 40 minutes at 85% RH. For PR772 and \u03C66, exposure to the reference condition at 20% RH for 10 minutes yielded the same results.

Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a major trans\u2010boundary disease in most Asian countries. Its sporadic re\u2010emergence suggests that collaborative FMD control strategies should be uniformly implemented in endemic countries to ensure the overall national herd vaccination coverage, biocontainment when outbreaks occur, and strict biosecurity control of animal movement between countries. Sustained commitments from governments, cooperative diplomatic relationships, and public awareness campaigns are critical to FMD control, to ensure collaboration among veterinarians, traders and farmers throughout Southeast Asia (SEA). Recently, highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (HP\u2010PRRS) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) spread from China to Southeast Asian countries, causing major economic losses. Foot and mouth disease, HP\u2010PRRS, and PED currently remain endemic and may continue to sporadically re\u2010emerge, owing to inadequate public health management and/or biosecurity failures. Therefore, the risk factors must be identified to better understand the epidemiology of these diseases in an effort to develop effective control measures. International coordination through the establishment of a collaborative network supported by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) should be implemented to prevent trans\u2010boundary transmission among countries. This review discusses trans\u2010boundary swine diseases of particular importance to SEA, including FMD, HP\u2010PRRS and PED, with a primary focus on major factors contributing to the spread of these diseases and important control measures, reflecting the impact of globalization on disease control and surveillance.","publish_time":"2012-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Na Ayudhya, S.

Attendees were subjected to a condensed, plausible, pandemic influenza scenario and asked to simulate the high-level strategic decisions made by leaders by internal (eg, Chief Medical Officer, Chief Nursing Officer, and Legal Affairs) and external (eg, city, state, and federal public health and emergency management entities) partners across an integrated system of acute, postacute, and ambulatory sites, challenging players to question their assumptions about managing the consequences of a highly pathogenic pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madad, Syra; Moskovitz, Joshua; Boyce, Matthew R; Cagliuso, Nicholas V.; Katz, Rebecca","journal":"Disaster Med Public Health Prep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5f3769d1068cde91cdbe75434793532d7eb8924.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108645.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32172715/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["New York City Health   Hospitals","Legal Affairs"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["health-care infrastructure","federal public health","New York City Health","intensive care","Chief Medical Officer","pathogenic pandemic","United States\u2019 largest municipal health-care delivery system","Chief Nursing Officer","pandemic influenza scenario","modern-day infectious diseases","half-day executive-level pandemic response workshop","medical technology","urban environments","front-line level","integrated system of acute","well-prepared response systems","Large urban centers","sanitation","partners","Hospitals","emergency management entities","great gains","medicine","ambulatory sites","society","communicable disease events","leaders","antibiotics","Legal Affairs","challenging players","areas of vaccines","high-level strategic decisions","unprecedented rates","past century","assumptions","consequences","globe","developments","Attendees","complexity"],"language":"en"},

Over the past 25 years, the prevalence of FeLV infection has decreased considerably, thanks both to reliable tests for the identification of viraemic carriers and to effective vaccines. Infection Transmission between cats occurs mainly through friendly contacts, but also through biting. In large groups of non-vaccinated cats, around 30\u201340% will develop persistent viraemia, 30\u201340% show transient viraemia and 20\u201330% seroconvert. Young kittens are especially susceptible to FeLV infection. Disease signs The most common signs of persistent FeLV viraemia are immune suppression, anaemia and lymphoma. Less common signs are immune-mediated disease, chronic enteritis, reproductive disorders and peripheral neuropathies. Most persistently viraemic cats die within 2\u20133 years. Diagnosis In low-prevalence areas there may be a risk of false-positive results; a doubtful positive test result in a healthy cat should therefore be confirmed, preferably by PCR for provirus. Asymptomatic FeLV-positive cats should be retested. Disease management Supportive therapy and good nursing care are required. Secondary infections should be treated promptly. Cats infected with FeLV should remain indoors. Vaccination against common pathogens should be maintained. Inactivated vaccines are recommended. The virus does not survive for long outside the host. Vaccination recommendations All cats with an uncertain FeLV status should be tested prior to vaccination. All healthy cats at potential risk of exposure should be vaccinated against FeLV. Kittens should be vaccinated at 8\u20139 weeks of age, with a second vaccination at 12 weeks, followed by a booster 1 year later. The ABCD suggests that, in cats older than 3\u20134 years of age, a booster every 2\u20133 years suffices, in view of the significantly lower susceptibility of older cats.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lutz, Hans; Addie, Diane; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Hosie, Margaret J.; Lloret, Albert; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D.; Thiry, Etienne; Truyen, Uwe; Horzinek, Marian C.","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19e72f6515d6b7a760a20948f0f5708c21cccf1c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X0900117X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481036/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X0900117X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","ABCD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthy cats","viraemic cats","cats older","Asymptomatic FeLV-positive cats","prevalence of FeLV infection","common signs of persistent FeLV viraemia","uncertain FeLV status","lower susceptibility of older cats","Disease signs","large groups of non-vaccinated cats","years of age","persistent viraemia","Vaccination recommendations","immune-mediated disease","positive results","immune suppression","immune system","anaemia","common pathogens","Infection Transmission","lymphoma","transient viraemia","booster","weeks of age","doubtful positive test result","Disease management Supportive therapy","risk of false","effective vaccines","Young kittens","Inactivated vaccines","potential risk of exposure","identification of viraemic carriers","low-prevalence areas","Abstract Overview Feline leukaemia virus","chronic enteritis","reproductive disorders","good nursing care","peripheral neuropathies","reliable tests","depression","thanks","friendly contacts","Diagnosis","retrovirus","biting","ABCD","PCR","provirus","Secondary infections","host"],"language":"en"},

Many bacteria exist as biofilms inside their hosts. We hypothesize that M. haemolytica colonization of cattle during its commensal state may include biofilm formation. To begin to assess this possibility, we developed an in vitro system to study biofilm formation directly on bovine respiratory epithelial cells. Using fixed primary bovine bronchial epithelial cells, we observed M. haemolytica biofilm formation after a 48h incubation period at 37\u00B0C. Addition of mucin, the main component of mucus present in the upper respiratory tract, decreased M. haemolytica biofilm formation on bovine epithelial cells. We investigated the effects of prior viral infection of the epithelial cells on subsequent biofilm formation by M. haemolytica and found negligible effects. Utilization of this model system will provide new insights into the potential role of biofilm formation by M. haemolytica in the pathogenesis of BRDC.","publish_time":"2016-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boukahil, Ismail; Czuprynski, Charles J.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98a6d580176426d4137aee4aec619a56f1e18f7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126505.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.11.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27938674/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516302681; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516302681","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["haemolytica biofilm formation","haemolytica cells","bovine epithelial cells","subsequent biofilm formation","bovine respiratory epithelial cells","haemolytica colonization of cattle","potential role of biofilm formation","Abstract Mannheimia haemolytica","upper respiratory tract of cattle","bovine respiratory disease complex","fixed primary bovine bronchial epithelial cells","cattle industry","model system","pathogenesis of BRDC","negligible effects","effects of prior viral infection","main component of mucus present","important bacterial agent","tonsillar crypts","new insights","commensal state","Addition of mucin","h incubation period","economic losses","biofilms","hosts","Utilization","lungs","possibility"],"language":"en"},

Most EIDs appear to result from increased contact between wildlife and humans, especially when humans encroach into formerly pristine habitats. Habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife species, which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to host viruses closely related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples. However, we found that bats infected with either astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective other virus. Additionally, we identified two more risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season. Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces. The identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals, including humans.","publish_time":"2017-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seltmann, Anne; Corman, Victor M.; Rasche, Andrea; Drosten, Christian; Czirj\u00E1k, G\u00E1bor \u00C1.; Bernard, Henry; Struebig, Matthew J.; Voigt, Christian C.","journal":"Ecohealth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2f5bbb2aea81e60dfa2567f8e70987db13ba34e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087689.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28500421/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-017-1245-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased shedding","increased viral shedding","astrovirus shedding","important EIDs","humans","Bats","higher probability of shedding astroviruses","increased contact","increased interspecies transmission","higher susceptibility","anthropogenic habitat disturbance","Habitat deterioration","coronaviruses","health of wildlife species","astrovirus detection rates","identification of risk factors","detection rate of astroviruses","viral spillovers","infectious agents","occurrence of astro","global health","bat species","Emerging infectious diseases","poor body condition","fragmentation","ongoing logging","paleotropical forest","individuals","fecal samples","hypothesis","major threat","physiology","animals","trend","contrast","beginning","feces","pathogens","dry season","pristine habitats"],"language":"en"},

In addition, ARG significantly reduced SVCV-induced apoptosis and recovered SVCV-activated caspase-3/8/9 activity. Further, cellular morphological damage induced by SVCV was blocked by ARG treatment. Mechanistically, ARG did not affect SVCV infectivity. Moreover, ARG could not induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which plays an antiviral role on SVCV. Interestingly, SVCV-induced autophagy which is necessary for virus replication was inhibited by ARG treatment. These results indicated that the inhibition of ARG on SVCV replication was, at least in part, via blocking SVCV-induced autophagy.

Repeated infections occur throughout life, but its immune evasion mechanisms are largely unknown. We recently found that hMPV M2-2 protein elicits immune evasion by targeting mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), an antiviral signaling molecule. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such inhibition are not known. Our mutagenesis studies revealed that PDZ-binding motifs, 29-DEMI-32 and 39-KEALSDGI-46, located in an immune inhibitory region of M2-2, are responsible for M2-2-mediated immune evasion. We also found both motifs prevent TRAF5 and TRAF6, the MAVS downstream adaptors, to be recruited to MAVS, while the motif 39-KEALSDGI-46 also blocks TRAF3 migrating to MAVS. In parallel, these TRAFs are important in activating transcription factors NF-kB and/or IRF-3 by hMPV. Our findings collectively demonstrate that M2-2 uses its PDZ motifs to launch the hMPV immune evasion through blocking the interaction of MAVS and its downstream TRAFs.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yu; Deng, Xiaoling; Deng, Junfang; Zhou, Jiehua; Ren, Yuping; Liu, Shengxuan; Prusak, Deborah J.; Wood, Thomas G.; Bao, Xiaoyong","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd54e45c61677a09e56a61b0216866c972705d54.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5102771.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682216302860; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682216302860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27743962/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAVS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hMPV immune evasion","hMPV M2","immune evasion mechanisms","interaction of MAVS","immune inhibitory region of M2","MAVS downstream adaptors","PDZ motifs","protein","PDZ-binding motifs","downstream TRAFs","KEALSDGI","mitochondrial antiviral","molecular mechanisms","major cause of lower respiratory infection","activating transcription factors NF","TRAF6","life","young children","TRAF5","mutagenesis studies","Abstract Human metapneumovirus","Repeated infections","inhibition","IRF","TRAF3","molecule","findings"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this surveillance was to detect severe influenza cases, identify their epidemiological and virological characteristics and assess their impact on the healthcare system. METHOD: We describe in this report the findings of laboratory-based surveillance of human cases of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses\u0027 infection during three seasons in Tunisia. RESULTS: The 2008\u201309 winter influenza season is underway in Tunisia, with co-circulation of influenza A/H3N2 (56.25%), influenza A(H1N1) (32.5%), and a few sporadic influenza B viruses (11.25%). In 2010\u201311 season the circulating strains are predominantly the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (70%) and influenza B viruses (22%). And sporadic viruses were sub-typed as A/H3N2 and unsubtyped influenza A, 5% and 3%, respectively. Unlike other countries, highest prevalence of influenza B virus Yamagata-like lineage has been reported in Tunisia (76%) localised into the clade B/Bangladesh/3333/2007. In the pandemic year, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated over other influenza viruses (95%). Amino acid changes D222G and D222E were detected in the HA gene of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in two severe cases, one fatal case and one mild case out of 50 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses studied. The most frequently reported respiratory virus other than influenza in three seasons was RSV (45.29%). CONCLUSION: This article summarises the surveillance and epidemiology of influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses, showing how rapid improvements in influenza surveillance were feasible by connecting the existing structure in the health care system for patient records to electronic surveillance system for reporting ILI cases.","publish_time":"2013-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Moussi, Awatef; Pozo, Francisco; Ben Hadj Kacem, Mohamed Ali; Ledesma, Juan; Cuevas, Maria Teresa; Casas, Inmaculada; Slim, Amine","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e54a9696e0da89388b8edef0dbe18a5f674a245b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3777972.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0074064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24069267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Tunisia"],"keyphrases":["influenza surveillance","pandemic influenza","unsubtyped influenza","circulation of influenza viruses","epidemiology of influenza viruses","sporadic influenza B viruses","severe influenza cases","co-circulation of influenza","winter influenza season","pdm09 viruses","based surveillance of human cases of influenza virus","sporadic viruses","H1N1","highest prevalence of influenza B virus Yamagata","electronic surveillance system","severe cases","Tunisia","clade B","reporting ILI cases","healthcare system","H3N2","seasons","OBJECTIVE","health care system","respiratory viruses\u0027 infection","fatal case","mild case","pandemic year","patient records","D222E","rapid improvements","existing structure","findings of laboratory","lineage","better understanding","Amino acid changes D222G","impact","countries","virological characteristics","HA gene","circulating strains","North-Africa","data","article","Bangladesh","CONCLUSION","RSV","BACKGROUND","METHOD","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To examine leader-mRNA junction sequences on subgenomic mRNAs, specific oligodeoxynucleotide sets were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify junction sequences from either the positive-strand mRNA (eight of nine total identified species) or the negative-strand anti-mRNA (six of the nine species), and sequenced. The mRNA species studied were those for the N, M, S, and HE structural proteins and the 9.5-, 12.7-, 4.8-, and 4.9-kDa putative nonstructural proteins. By defining the leader-mRNA junction sequence as the sequence between (i) the point of mismatch between the leader and genome and (ii) the 3\u2032 end of the consensus heptameric intergenic sequence [(U/A)C(U/C)AAAC)], or its variant, a unique junction sequence was found for each subgenomic mRNA species studied. In one instance (mRNA for the 12.7-kDa protein) the predicted intergenic sequence UCCAAAC was not part of the junction region, and in its place was the nonconforming sequence GGTAGAC that occurs just 15 nt downstream in the genome. Leader-mRNA junction sequences found after 296 days of persistent infection were the same as those found during acute infection (\u003C18 hr postinfection). These data indicate that, in contrast to the closely related mouse hepatitis virus, the bovine coronavirus maintains a stable leader-mRNA junction sequence for each mRNA. Interestingly, this stability may be related to the fact that a UCUAA sequence element, postulated by others to be a regulator of the leader-mRNA fusion event, occurs only once within the 3\u2032 flanking sequence of the genomic leader donor and once at intergenic sites in the bovine coronavirus genome, whereas it occurs two to four times at these sites in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus.","publish_time":"1993-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hofmann, Martin A.; Chang, Ruey-yi; Ku, Seulah; Brian, David A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682283714649; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682283714649","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stable leader-mRNA junction sequence","leader-mRNA junction sequences","common leader sequence","unique junction sequence","subgenomic mRNA species","flanking sequence","leader-mRNA fusion event","positive-strand mRNA","nonconforming sequence GGTAGAC","UCUAA sequence element","junction region","consensus heptameric intergenic sequence","predicted intergenic sequence UCCAAAC","negative-strand anti-mRNA","bovine coronavirus genome","genomic leader donor","bovine coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs","mouse hepatitis coronavirus","intergenic sites","total identified species","related mouse hepatitis virus","kDa protein","kDa putative nonstructural proteins","acute infection","days of persistent infection","specific oligodeoxynucleotide sets","polymerase chain reaction","place","fact","contrast","end","variant","hr postinfection","point of mismatch","regulator","times","stability","data","instance"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model was used to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi. Assuming the prevalence of TB in Delhi to be 0.55%, 53% of SARS-CoV2 infected TB cases to present with severe disease we estimated the number of SARS-CoV2 infected TB cases and the number of severe patients. The modelling used estimated R(0) for two scenarios, without any intervention and with public health interventions. RESULTS: We observed that the peak of SARS-CoV-2-TB co-infected patients would occur on the 94th day in absence of public health interventions and on 138(th) day in presence of interventions. There could be 20,880 SARS-CoV-2 infected TB cases on peak day of epidemic when interventions are implemented and 27,968 cases in the absence of intervention. Among them, there could be 14,823 patients with severe disease when no interventions are implemented and 11,066 patients with severe disease in the presence of intervention.

Given its potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs or vaccines, MERS is one of the WHO priority diseases warranting urgent research and development of countermeasures. We aimed to assess safety and tolerability of an anti-MERS-CoV modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine candidate that expresses the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein, MVA-MERS-S, in healthy adults. METHODS: This open-label, phase 1 trial was done at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Participants were healthy men and women aged 18\u201355 years with no clinically significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination, a body-mass index of 18\u00B75\u201330\u00B70 kg/m(2) and weight of more than 50 kg at screening, and a negative pregnancy test for women. A key exclusion criterion was a previous MVA vaccination. For the prime immunisation, participants received doses of 1 \u00D7 10(7) plaque-forming unit (PFU; low-dose group) or 1 \u00D7 10(8) PFU (high-dose group) MVA-MERS-S intramuscularly. A second identical dose was administered intramuscularly as a booster immunisation 28 days after first injection. As a control group for immunogenicity analyses, blood samples were drawn at identical study timepoints from six healthy adults, who did not receive any injections. The primary objectives of the study were safety and tolerability of the two dosage levels and reactogenicity after administration. Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary endpoint by ELISA and neutralisation tests. T-cell immunity was evaluated by interferon-\u03B3-linked enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay. All participants who were vaccinated at least once were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity was analysed in the participants who completed 6 months of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615911, and EudraCT, 2014-003195-23 FINDINGS: From Dec 17, 2017, to June 5, 2018, 26 participants (14 in the low-dose group and 12 in the high-dose group) were enrolled and received the first dose of the vaccine according to their group allocation. Of these, 23 participants (12 in the low-dose group and 11 in the high-dose group) received a second dose of MVA-MERS-S according to their group allocation after a 28-day interval and completed follow-up. Homologous prime\u2013boost immunisation with MVA-MERS-S revealed a benign safety profile with only transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. Participants had no severe or serious adverse events. 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten (71%) of 14 participants in the low-dose group, and 111 were reported in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the high-dose group. Solicited local reactions were the most common adverse events: pain was observed in 17 (65%; seven in the low-dose group vs ten in the high-dose group) participants, swelling in ten (38%; two vs eight) participants, and induration in ten (38%; one vs nine) participants. Headaches (observed in seven participants in the low-dose group vs nine in the high-dose group) and fatigue or malaise (ten vs seven participants) were the most common solicited systemic adverse events. All adverse events resolved swiftly (within 1\u20133 days) and without sequelae. Following booster immunisation, nine (75%) of 12 participants in the low-dose group and 11 (100%) participants in the high-dose group showed seroconversion using a MERS-CoV S1 ELISA at any timepoint during the study. Binding antibody titres correlated with MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies (Spearman\u0027s correlation r=0\u00B786 [95% CI 0\u00B76960\u20130\u00B79427], p=0\u00B70001). MERS-CoV spike-specific T-cell responses were detected in ten (83%) of 12 immunised participants in the low-dose group and ten (91%) of 11 immunised participants in the high-dose group. INTERPRETATION: Vaccination with MVA-MERS-S had a favourable safety profile without serious or severe adverse events. Homologous prime\u2013boost immunisation induced humoral and cell-mediated responses against MERS-CoV. A dose\u2013effect relationship was demonstrated for reactogenicity, but not for vaccine-induced immune responses. The data presented here support further clinical testing of MVA-MERS-S in larger cohorts to advance MERS vaccine development.

They were initially characterised as inhibitors of lysosomal cysteine proteases, however, in recent years some alternative functions for cystatins have been proposed. Cystatins possessing inhibitory function are members of three families, family I (stefins), family II (cystatins) and family III (kininogens). Stefin A is often linked to neoplastic changes in epithelium while another family I cystatin, stefin B is supposed to have a specific role in neuredegenerative diseases. Cystatin C, a typical type II cystatin, is expressed in a variety of human tissues and cells. On the other hand, expression of other type II cystatins is more specific. Cystatin F is an endo/lysosome targeted protease inhibitor, selectively expressed in immune cells, suggesting its role in processes related to immune response. Our recent work points on its role in regulation of dendritic cell maturation and in natural killer cells functional inactivation that may enhance tumor survival. Cystatin E/M expression is mainly restricted to the epithelia of the skin which emphasizes its prominent role in cutaneous biology. Here, we review the current knowledge on type I (stefins A and B) and type II cystatins (cystatins C, F and E/M) in pathologies, with particular emphasis on their suppressive vs. promotional function in the tumorigenesis and metastasis. We proposed that an imbalance between cathepsins and cystatins may attenuate immune cell functions and facilitate tumor cell invasion.","publish_time":"2012-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magister, \u0160pela; Kos, Janko","journal":"J Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f9572ae671d876279b4d2cd6b6544b24fb3e52d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3564246.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7150/jca.5044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23386904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cystatins"],"organizations":["Cystatin E/M"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cystatins C","Cystatin C","Cystatin F","Cystatin E","immune cells","specific role","immune cell functions","prominent role","typical type","tumor cell invasion","stefins","immune response","expression","stefin B","regulation of dendritic cell maturation","promotional function","recent years","alternative functions","inhibitory function","tumor survival","natural killer cells functional inactivation","recent work points","large superfamily of related proteins","endo","lysosome targeted protease inhibitor","diverse biological activities","families","members","particular emphasis","tumorigenesis","epithelium","processes","cathepsins","inhibitors of lysosomal cysteine proteases","neoplastic changes","variety of human tissues","pathologies","metastasis","skin","cutaneous biology","neuredegenerative diseases","current knowledge","epithelia","imbalance","hand"],"language":"en"},

ADE is considered to be a significant obstacle to developing effective vaccines for many viruses for which ADE has been reported, since virus-specific antibodies of maternal origin or those conferred by vaccination can facilitate the entry of the virus into target cells, sometimes resulting in increased severity of the disease. In this study, the role of specific PRRS viral epitopes in ADE and/or virus neutralization (VN) was assessed in vitro using 14 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to 4 PRRS viral proteins: nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), glycoprotein (GP) 5, and GP3. Each mAb recongnized a distinct epitope on one of these proteins. One-way ADE and VN assays were performed in vitro using homologous PRRS virus isolates in the presence or absence of each mAb. ADE activity was determined by detecting a significant increase of progeny virus yield in porcine alveolar macrophage cultures in the presence of individual mAbs. Neutralizing activity was determined by detecting a significant reduction or complete blocking of virus replication in MARC-145 cells in the presence of individual mAbs. mAbs could be categorized into 3 groups: enhancing, neutralizing and neither. Viral epitopes which are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies appeared to reside on the M, GP3 and GP5 proteins, while epitopes that may induce ADE-mediating antibody were associated with the N and GP5 proteins. Identification of the viral proteins and antigens and epitopes responsible for ADE- and VN-mediating antibodies may provide the basis for developing efficacious second-generation vaccines for the control of PRRS virus; yet, further epitope mapping remains to be done.","publish_time":"2004-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cancel-Tirado, Sol M.; Evans, Richard B.; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe5e4649951a2810ceb92aee9055d96ac0efda29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173136.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704002594; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704002594","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADE","PRRS","VN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ADE activity","control of PRRS virus","PRRS viral proteins","virus neutralization","One-way ADE","ADE-mediating antibody","homologous PRRS virus isolates","GP5 proteins","role of specific PRRS viral epitopes","virus-specific antibodies of maternal origin","presence of specific antibody","presence of individual mAbs","complete blocking of virus replication","VN-mediating antibodies","significant increase of progeny virus yield","epitopes responsible","monoclonal antibodies","Neutralizing activity","capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies","significant reduction","significant obstacle","VN assays","GP3","replication of porcine reproductive","antibody-dependent enhancement","effective vaccines","target cells","distinct epitope","epitope mapping","efficacious second-generation vaccines","porcine alveolar macrophage cultures","MARC","respiratory syndrome","antigens","basis","nucleocapsid","Enhanced infection","entry","absence","increased severity","vaccination","matrix","phenomenon","viruses","study","Identification","glycoprotein","disease","groups"],"language":"en"},

No Eimeria oocysts were detected using the flotation method. In comparison with post-weaned calves with diarrhea, in diarrhea-recovered calves, the lymphocyte count was significantly higher (P = 0.018), and the monocyte count was significantly lower (P = 0.001); however, the number of monocytes was still high. Post-weaned calves with diarrhea had a significantly higher Hp concentration (P \u003C 0.001) compared with diarrhea-recovered calves. The results indicated that increased Hp concentration and monocytosis but not SAA may be associated with diarrhea caused by BCoV.

DESIGN: Rapid review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar, searched up to late March 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: Any study that described the psychological reactions of healthcare staff working with patients in an outbreak of any emerging virus in any clinical setting, irrespective of any comparison with other clinicians or the general population. RESULTS: 59 papers met the inclusion criteria: 37 were of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), eight of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), seven of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), three each of Ebola virus disease and influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and one of influenza A virus subtype H7N9. Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure. Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes. These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis. Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member. Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed. Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Effective interventions are available to help mitigate the psychological distress experienced by staff caring for patients in an emerging disease outbreak. These interventions were similar despite the wide range of settings and types of outbreaks covered in this review, and thus could be applicable to the current covid-19 outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kisely, Steve; Warren, Nicola; McMahon, Laura; Dalais, Christine; Henry, Irene; Siskind, Dan","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d980def570b9dcde88b7b49155368fbcc733bbb1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199468.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["psychological distress","psychological support","psychological effects","psychological outcomes of healthcare workers","psychological reactions of healthcare staff","affected patients","emerging virus","meta-analysis","Ebola virus disease","emerging disease outbreak","virus subtype H1N1","virus subtype H7N9","influenza","Risk factors","coronavirus disease","clinicians","similar results","studies","severe acute respiratory syndrome","lack of practical support","lower risk controls","low risk of exposure","direct contact","adequate rest","types of outbreaks","STUDY SELECTION","inclusion criteria","Middle East respiratory syndrome","continuous outcomes","DATA SOURCES","ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA","Rapid review","Effective interventions","current covid","adequate personal protection","post-traumatic stress","novel viral outbreaks","PubMed","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","odds ratio","greater levels","successful measures","Scopus","PsycInfo","Medline","access","SARS","Web of Science","wide range of settings","Embase","MERS","Clear communication","Google Scholar","comparison","confidence interval","Longer quarantine","clinical setting","DESIGN","parents of dependent children","infected family member","CONCLUSIONS","papers","stigma","reduced morbidity","general population","OBJECTIVE","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, IFN is produced in infected macrophages, microglia, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). To begin to understand why IFN is produced in infected macrophages, we infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and as a control, bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). As expected, BMM but not BMDC expressed type I IFN. IFN production in infected BMM was nearly completely dependent on signaling through the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) receptor (IFNAR). Several IFN-dependent cytokines and chemokines showed the same expression pattern, with enhanced production in BMM compared to BMDC and dependence upon signaling through the IFNAR. Exogenous IFN enhanced IFN-dependent gene expression in BMM at early times after infection and in BMDC at all times after infection but did not stimulate expression of molecules that signal through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Collectively, our results show that IFN is produced at early times postinfection (p.i.) in MHV-infected BMM, but not in BMDC, and primes expression of IFN and IFN-responsive genes. Further, our results also show that BMM are generally more responsive to MHV infection, since MyD88-dependent pathways are also activated to a greater extent in these cells than in BMDC.","publish_time":"2010-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Haixia; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd0863296aa29156993cde032a4f7f42f5133fff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2957079.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00219-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20978536/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","BMDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN production","IFN-\u03B1","BMDC","primes expression of IFN","IFN-dependent cytokines","Exogenous IFN enhanced IFN-dependent gene expression","IFN-responsive genes","MHV-infected BMM","infected macrophages","MHV infection","nonhematopoietic cells","expression pattern","expression of molecules","conventional dendritic cells","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","MyD88-dependent pathways","bone marrow-derived macrophages","enhanced production","early times postinfection","IFNAR","results","bone marrow-derived DC","beta interferon","myeloid differentiation factor","tumor necrosis factor","induction","coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","control","microglia","chemokines","receptor","cDC","alpha","TNF","pDC","greater extent","dependence","type","Coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies demonstrated that MMTV could induce pH 5-dependent fusion-from-without of mouse cells. Here we show that the MMTV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion requires both the entry receptor and low pH (pH 5). Although expression of the MMTV envelope and TfR1 was sufficient to mediate low pH-dependent syncytia formation, virus infection required trafficking to a low pH compartment; infection was independent of cathepsin-mediated proteolysis. Human TfR1 did not support virus infection, although envelope-mediated syncytia formation occurred with human cells after pH 5 treatment and this fusion depended on TfR1 expression. However, although the MMTV envelope bound human TfR1, virus was only internalized and trafficked to a low pH compartment in cells expressing mouse TfR1. Thus, while human TfR1 supported cell-cell fusion, because it was not internalized when bound to MMTV, it did not function as an entry receptor. Our data suggest that MMTV uses TfR1 for all steps of entry: cell attachment, induction of the conformational changes in Env required for membrane fusion and internalization to an appropriate acidic compartment.","publish_time":"2008-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Enxiu; Obeng-Adjei, Nyamekye; Ying, Qihua; Meertens, Laurent; Dragic, Tanya; Davey, Robert A.; Ross, Susan R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ec62bec0f386755821ccda97c2f3635de6f0b48.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c3bf6844918d5395df15d1129235015e06ae4373.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2641025.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2641025?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208005217; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.08.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208005217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18829060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MMTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Human TfR1","mouse TfR1","pH-dependent virus","low pH compartment","TfR1 expression","MMTV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion","virus infection","dependent fusion","human cells","mouse cells","low pH-dependent syncytia formation","entry receptor","cell attachment","membrane fusion","envelope-mediated syncytia formation","Mouse mammary tumor virus","mouse transferrin receptor","steps of entry","mediated proteolysis","appropriate acidic compartment","trafficking","conformational changes","internalization","induction","independent of cathepsin","treatment","Previous studies","data"],"language":"en"},

Until a decade and half ago, IDs were the major cause of both morbidity and mortality accounting 70% for both. However, as a result of various preventive measures implemented by both the state and non-state actors, the overall IDs have shown a changing (declining) trend. The most impressive decline has been seen in the intestinal helminth infection. Though the overall burden of IDs is decreasing, several newer infectious diseases (emerging infections) namely, dengue fever, scrub typhus, influenza (H5N1 and H1N1), and others are posing a great public health problem. On the other hand, though sporadic, outbreaks of endemic diseases together with HIV-TB coinfection and infection with drug resistance microbes during recent years have constituted a serious public health as well as medical problem. On the contrary, with the decline of IDs, noninfectious diseases (noncommunicable disease, NCD) namely, diabetes, cancer (and cancer therapy), and others are on the rise particularly in urban areas. Hence, currently Nepal is trapped in \u201Cdouble burden\u201D of diseases. Risk of opportunistic infection has increased in immunocompromised person with NCD.

A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21(st) 2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 26000 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,000. Since the confirmed cases are believed to be between 10 and 20% of the real number of individuals who eventually get infected, the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 falls between 4% and 8% in Italy, while it appears substantially lower, between 1% and 3% in China. Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2500 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate. This appears only possible through a concerted and disciplined, albeit painful, effort of the population as a whole.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fanelli, Duccio; Piazza, Francesco","journal":"Chaos Solitons Fractals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1267c9e461b0f70ed1ce7c5f50989951d0b903e3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fd05a8fff57b7100589390bcd74f1752cbf5ddcd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156225.xml.json","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06031v1.pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920301636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308258/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109761; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920301636","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","France"],"keyphrases":["epidemic peak","Italy","peak number of infected individuals","infection rate","peak requirement","epidemic spreading","rate of recovery","simple susceptible-infected","number of deaths","real number of individuals","apparent mortality rate of COVID","outbreak","deaths model","analysis of simple day","China","time window","simple mean-field models","confirmed cases","France","coronavirus disease","effects of drastic containment measures","fair figure","maps points","health authorities","kinetic parameter","Formula","universality","data","height","reduction","quench","ventilation units","temporal dynamics","death rates","strategic planning","appreciable decrease","simulation","text","end","quantitative picture","falls","effort","population","epidemics","country","calculations"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: TMC was synthesized by free radical polymerization and blank nanoparticles were prepared by ionic crosslinking of TMC and sodium tripolyphosphate. The model antigen (ovalbumin) was conjugated on the surface of blank nanoparticles (OVA-NP) through thioester bond formation. The cellular uptake of OVA-NP was investigated in Raw 264.7 macrophages and biodistribution of antigens was studied by the radioiodine labeling method. The immunological effects were evaluated by nasal administration of OVA-NP to Balb/C mice. The transport mechanism and nasal toxicity of OVA-NP were studied in rats. RESULTS: The cellular uptake of OVA-NP was significantly higher than that of ovalbumin-encapsulated nanoparticles (NPe) after 30 min. Nasally administered OVA-NP showed higher transport of antigens to cervical lymph nodes with higher targeting efficiency than all other groups. Compared with NPe, OVA-NP induced much higher levels of systemic and mucosal immune responses in Balb/C mice after three nasal immunizations. Ex vivo culturing of nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) confirmed its participation in nasal immunization. The transport mechanism study revealed that OVA-NP can be transported across the nasal epithelium through glands and may be taken up in NALT through M cells. OVA-NP did not induce obvious toxicity to nasal mucosa or hemolysis in animals. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that the conjugation of TMC nanoparticles with antigens is an effective strategy for nasal vaccination.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Qingfeng; Zheng, Xiaoyao; Zhang, Chi; Shao, Xiayan; Zhang, Xi; Zhang, Qizhi; Jiang, Xinguo","journal":"Pharm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b538914788421e798e728812660436afb3df921.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089071.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-014-1441-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970313/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nasally"],"organizations":["TMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["administered OVA-NP","nasal toxicity of OVA","nasal administration of OVA","nasal mucosa","nasal vaccination","nasal immunizations","nasal epithelium","cellular uptake of OVA","higher transport of antigens","conjugation of TMC nanoparticles","surface of blank nanoparticles","ovalbumin-encapsulated nanoparticles","biodistribution of antigens","higher levels of systemic","transport mechanism study","mucosal immune responses","higher targeting efficiency","Balb","ionic crosslinking of TMC","C mice","NALT","NPe","obvious toxicity","surface of N","present study","cervical lymph nodes","effective strategy","free radical polymerization","hemolysis","trimethylaminoethylmethacrylate chitosan","nasopharynx","sodium tripolyphosphate","participation","macrophages","thioester bond formation","lymphoid tissue","groups","animals","immunological effects","RESULTS","radioiodine labeling method","model antigen","CONCLUSION","METHODS","glands","rats","Ex","cells","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

So far, there are no drugs available for treatment of rhinovirus infection. We examined the effect of quercetin, a plant flavanol on RV infection in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment of airway epithelial cells with quercetin decreased Akt phosphosphorylation, viral endocytosis and IL-8 responses. Addition of quercetin 6 h after RV infection (after viral endocytosis) reduced viral load, IL-8 and IFN responses in airway epithelial cells. This was associated with decreased levels of negative and positive strand viral RNA, and RV capsid protein, abrogation of RV-induced eIF4GI cleavage and increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1. In mice infected with RV, quercetin treatment decreased viral replication as well as expression of chemokines and cytokines. Quercetin treatment also attenuated RV-induced airway cholinergic hyperresponsiveness. Together, our results suggest that quercetin inhibits RV endocytosis and replication in airway epithelial cells at multiple stages of the RV life cycle. Quercetin also decreases expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improves lung function in RV-infected mice. Based on these observations, further studies examining the potential benefits of quercetin in the prevention and treatment of RV infection are warranted.","publish_time":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ganesan, Shyamala; Faris, Andrea N.; Comstock, Adam T.; Wang, Qiong; Nanua, Suparna; Hershenson, Marc B.; Sajjan, Uma S.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1d19a77fecd4fde688e814a79bdcb3afe490853.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b8e6bd7d27717bee3546f567af60d59153991c87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3360794.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354212000630; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3360794?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354212000630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22465313/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.03.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","RV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV endocytosis","treatment of RV infection","abrogation of RV","quercetin treatment","RV-infected mice","effect of quercetin","Addition of quercetin","RV capsid protein","RV life cycle","viral endocytosis","RV-induced airway cholinergic hyperresponsiveness","viral replication","potential benefits of quercetin","treatment of rhinovirus infection","viral load","Pretreatment of airway epithelial cells","positive strand viral RNA","decreased levels of negative","expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines","IFN responses","expression of chemokines","induced eIF4GI cleavage","multiple stages","Akt phosphosphorylation","lung function","asthma","patients","prevention","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","exacerbations","increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1","plant flavanol","majority of common colds","studies","drugs available","results","observations"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the study was to study and to compare simple infections and viral coinfections of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized children. From September 2005 to August 2013, a prospective study was conducted on children younger than 14 years of age, admitted with respiratory infection to the Pediatric Department of the Severo Ochoa Hospital, in Spain. Specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were taken for virological study by using polymerase chain reaction, and clinical data were recorded. Simple RSV infections were selected and compared with double infections of RSV with rhinovirus (RV) or with human bocavirus (HBoV). In this study, 2993 episodes corresponding to 2525 children were analyzed. At least 1 virus was detected in 77% (2312) of the episodes. Single infections (599 RSV, 513 RV, and 81 HBoV) were compared with 120 RSV-RV and 60 RSV-HBoV double infections. The RSV-RV coinfections had fever (63% vs 43%; P \u003C 0.001) and hypoxia (70% vs 43%; P \u003C 0.001) more often than RV infections. Hypoxia was similar between single or dual infections (71%). Bronchiolitis was more frequent in the RSV simple group (P \u003C 0.001). Pediatric intensive care unit admission was more common in RSV simple or RSV-RV groups than in the RV monoinfection (P = 0.042).

The symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases; but may progress to respiratory distress and organ failure. Transmission is through droplet infection or fomites, but other modes such as airborne transmission and oro-fecal transmission is also speculated. Research is underway to develop effective vaccines and medicines for the disease. In such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics. Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment. In Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of health-protecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs. Drugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W. G. Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za\u0027fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc. are prescribed in various forms.

In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structure of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) spike protein from the \u03B3-genus. The trimeric IBV spike ectodomain contains three receptor-binding S1 heads and a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. While IBV S2 is structurally similar to those from the other genera, IBV S1 possesses structural features that are unique to different other genera, thereby bridging these diverse spikes into an evolutionary spectrum. Specifically, among different genera, the two domains of S1, the N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), diverge from simpler tertiary structures and quaternary packing to more complex ones, leading to different functions of the spikes in receptor usage and membrane fusion. Based on the above structural and functional comparisons, we propose that the evolutionary spectrum of coronavirus spikes follows the order of \u03B1-, \u03B4-, \u03B3-, and \u03B2-genus.

Over the last three decades, various studies have shown that HCQ plays also a role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Although the mechanisms of action underlying the glucose-lowering properties of HCQ are still not entirely clear, evidence suggests that this drug may exert multifaceted effects on glucose regulation, including improvement of insulin sensitivity, increase of insulin secretion, reduction of hepatic insulin clearance and reduction of systemic inflammation. Preliminary studies have shown the safety and efficacy of HCQ (at a dose ranging from 400 to 600 mg/day) in patients with type 2 diabetes over a short-term period. In 2014, HCQ has been approved in India as an add-on hypoglycemic agent for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. However, large randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the safety and efficacy profile of HCQ in patients with type 2 diabetes over a long-term period. With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, several medications (including HCQ) have been used as off-label drugs due to the lack of proven effective therapies. However, emerging evidence shows limited benefit from HCQ use in COVID-19 in general. The aim of this manuscript is to comprehensively summarize the current knowledge on the antihyperglycemic properties of HCQ and to critically evaluate the potential risks and benefits related to HCQ use in patients with diabetes, even in light of the current pandemic scenario.

The success of these non-pharmaceutical strategies will depend not only on the effectiveness of quarantine or other isolation measures but also on the epidemiological characteristics of the infection. However, there is currently no systematic framework to assess the relationship between different containment strategies and the natural history and epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Here, we compare the effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring, implemented via contact tracing, in controlling epidemics using an agent-based branching model. We examine the relationship between epidemic containment and the disease dynamics of symptoms and infectiousness for seven case study diseases with diverse natural histories including Ebola, Influenza A, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). We show that the comparative effectiveness of symptom monitoring and quarantine depends critically on the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. The benefit of quarantine over symptom monitoring is generally maximized for fast-course diseases, but we show the conditions under which symptom monitoring alone can control certain outbreaks. This quantitative framework can guide policy-makers on how best to use non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain emerging outbreaks and prioritize research during an outbreak of a novel pathogen. Quarantine and symptom monitoring of contacts with suspected exposure to an infectious disease are key interventions for the control of emerging epidemics; however, there does not yet exist a quantitative framework for comparing the control performance of each. Here, we use a mathematical model of seven case study diseases to show how the choice of intervention is influenced by the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. We use this information to identify the most important characteristics of the disease and setting that need to be characterized for an emerging pathogen in order to make an informed decision between quarantine and symptom monitoring.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peak, Corey M; Childs, Lauren M; Grad, Yonatan H; Buckee, Caroline O","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b5f5119bbfbded3245acc37859cefde967458e7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/81c0d9d7bb524ec74d8842e2aa464021994ea85e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/072652","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of quarantine","symptom monitoring of contacts","emerging infectious disease outbreak","comparative effectiveness of symptom monitoring","emerging pathogen","natural history","benefit of quarantine","disease dynamics of symptoms","non-pharmaceutical strategies","emerging outbreaks","control of emerging epidemics","non-pharmaceutical interventions","intervention feasibility","quantitative framework","novel pathogen","case study diseases","particular healthcare setting","diverse natural histories","inherent transmissibility","different containment strategies","epidemiological dynamics","choice of intervention","relationship","epidemiological characteristics","systematic framework","control performance","fast-course diseases","key interventions","epidemic containment","mathematical model","certain outbreaks","branching model","important characteristics","Influenza","suspected exposure","Ebola","infectiousness","informed decision","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","drugs","isolation measures","SARS","order","research","vaccines","contact tracing","policy-makers","agent","success","information","infection","conditions"],"language":"en"},

Since its discovery in the early 1990s, tremendous progresses have been made in understanding the molecular biology and pathogenesis of PRRSV. Although modified live-attenuated vaccines (MLVs) and inactivated vaccines against PRRSV have been available for more than a decade, the disease remains difficult to control. The efficacies of these vaccines especially against heterologous strains remain questionable: the MLVs were generally effective against homologous strains but variable in success against heterologous strains, and the outcomes of inactivated vaccines in the field are not very promising. With the development of PRRSV reverse genetics systems and the acquisition of new understanding on anti-PRRSV immunity, rational design of the next generation of PRRSV vaccines can now be explored. In this review, we discussed the recent advances in anti-PRRSV immunity and vaccinology, the recent progresses in PRRSV vaccine development particularly the reverse genetics system-based vaccine development, and provided a perspective on potential novel strategies and approaches that may be applicable to the development of the next generation of PRRSV vaccines.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Y.

The rapid spread of PEDV has raised concerns about the role of feed and particularly pork-by-product components such as spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) in PEDV transmission. The aim of this study was to determine the infectivity of PEDV RNA present in commercial SDPP. Specifically, 40 3-week-old PEDV na\u00EFve pigs were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups. At day post inoculation (dpi) 0, NEG-CONTROL pigs were sham-inoculated, PEDV-CONTROL pigs received cell culture propagated PEDV, and SDPP-CONTROL pigs were switched to a diet with 5% SDPP containing 5.1\u00B10.1 log(10) PEDV RNA copies/g. To evaluate a potential positive effect of anti-PEDV antibodies in SDPP on PEDV challenge, four days prior to PEDV challenge the pigs in the SDPP-PEDV group were switched to and remained on a 5% SDPP diet through dpi 28. Another group, EGG-PEDV, was orally administered a commercial egg-derived liquid PEDV globulin product from dpi -4 through 6. All PEDV-CONTROL pigs began shedding PEDV in feces by dpi 3 and seroconverted between dpi 7 and 14, whereas pigs in NEG-CONTROL and SDPP-CONTROL groups remained PEDV RNA negative and did not seroconvert to PEDV for the study duration. This indicates no evidence of infectivity of the PEDV RNA in the SDPP lot utilized. Furthermore, under the study conditions SDPP or egg-derived liquid PEDV globulin addition did not significantly alter PEDV-shedding or overall disease course after experimental challenge.","publish_time":"2014-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Opriessnig, Tanja; Xiao, Chao-Ting; Gerber, Priscilla F.; Zhang, Jianqiang; Halbur, Patrick G.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/108b012df7e6ae774a2a83243c0662f376637426.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4130536.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25116479/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0104766","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","SDPP"],"locations":["North America","Canada","Mexico"],"keyphrases":["EGG-PEDV","PEDV challenge","PEDV-CONTROL pigs","SDPP-PEDV group","PEDV transmission","PEDV RNA negative","PEDV RNA copies","SDPP-CONTROL pigs","rapid spread of PEDV","week-old PEDV na\u00EFve pigs","infectivity of PEDV RNA present","commercial SDPP","SDPP-CONTROL groups","SDPP diet","SDPP lot","egg-derived liquid PEDV globulin addition","NEG-CONTROL pigs","commercial egg-derived liquid PEDV globulin product","study conditions SDPP","potential positive effect of anti-PEDV antibodies","experimental challenge","study duration","product components","evidence of infectivity","treatment groups","spray-dried porcine plasma","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","cell culture","concerns","overall disease course","North America","days","pork","log","role of feed","feces","day post inoculation","States","Canada","Mexico","aim"],"language":"en"},

Such a vaccine would be a \u2018B-cell epitope-based vaccine\u2019, the implementation of which requires the ability to backtrack from a desired antibody to its corresponding epitope. In this article we discuss a range of methods that enable epitope discovery based on a specific antibody. Such a reversed immunological approach is the first step in the rational design of an epitope-based vaccine. Undoubtedly, the gold standard for epitope definition is x-ray analyses of crystals of antigen: antibody complexes. This method provides atomic resolution of the epitope; however, it is not readily applicable to many antigens and antibodies, and requires a very high degree of sophistication and expertise. Most other methods rely on the ability to monitor the binding of the antibody to antigen fragments or mutated variations. In mutagenesis of the antigen, loss of binding due to point modification of an amino acid residue is often considered an indication of an epitope component. In addition, computational combinatorial methods for epitope mapping are also useful. These methods rely on the ability of the antibody of interest to affinity isolate specific short peptides from combinatorial phage display peptide libraries. The peptides are then regarded as leads for the definition of the epitope corresponding to the antibody used to screen the peptide library. For epitope mapping, computational algorithms have been developed, such as Mapitope, which has recently been found to be effective in mapping conformational discontinuous epitopes. The pros and cons of various approaches towards epitope mapping are also discussed.","publish_time":"2012-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gershoni, Jonathan M.; Roitburd-Berman, Anna; Siman-Tov, Dror D.; Freund, Natalia Tarnovitski; Weiss, Yael","journal":"BioDrugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1053f7e45b5bd7b63304aa0e13b064809875be2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100438.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100438/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mapitope"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epitope mapping","corresponding epitope","epitope definition","epitope discovery","epitope interaction","precise epitope","epitope component","specific antibody","B-cell epitope-based vaccine","desired antibody","antibody complexes","effective neutralizing antibody","ability","potent antibodies","potent neutralizing antibodies","computational combinatorial methods","antigen fragments","range of methods","specific short peptides","mapping conformational discontinuous epitopes","antibodies\u2019 specific recognition of epitopes","effective line of defense","rational design of preventive vaccines","loss of binding","computational algorithms","peptide library","target cell","combinatorial phage display peptide libraries","basis","analyses of crystals","modification","step","cons of various approaches","affinity","sites","indication","virus","mutated variations","generation","addition","amino acid residue","infectious diseases","gold standard","high degree of sophistication","expertise","reversed immunological approach","pros","atomic resolution","leads","implementation","mutagenesis","article","antigens","immunization","vaccinee","Mapitope"],"language":"en"},

The preferential binding of ATN(H) to lymphoblasts induces their 11-fold increased agglutination (81 \u00B1 7.8%) compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of normal donors (8 \u00B1 4.3%) which corroborates with flow cytometry studies. Agglutination of MOLT-4 (87 \u00B1 4.8%), a lymphoblastoid cell line and MDCK (91.25 \u00B1 0.01%), a cell line expressing surface 9-OAcSA, confirms the preferential binding of ATN(H) to lymphoblasts through their surface 9-OAcSGs. Furthermore, fluorometric quantitation reveals a 4.6-fold increase in % of 9-OAcSA on lymphoblasts of ALL patients (42.1 \u00B1 4.1%) compared to normal donors (9.2. \u00B1 3.4%).

However, the mechanisms governing the development of complications remain poorly studied. The present work reports the comparative assessment of the functional changes which take place in human ECV-304 endothelial cell sublines obtained previously by the long-term culturing of cells after exposure to varying infectious doses (IDs) of influenza A virus, and/or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It has been demonstrated that, in the course of long-term culturing (six passages) after exposure to pathogenic agents (influenza virus and/or LPS), endothelial cells maintain changes in their migratory activity, permeability, and expression of mRNA for cytokines TNF\u03B1 and TGF\u03B2 (along with the changes in their proliferation activity, which has been demonstrated earlier). The pattern of changes depended on the type of the agent (agents) to which the cells were exposed. The differences in migratory activity (which was at its maximum 4 h after wounding) between the cell sublines at the sixth passage correlated with the differences in their proliferation activity at the first passage (proliferation data were obtained previously). In particular, an increase in migration and proliferation was observed in the sublines exposed to low virus doses (ECV-1ID), as well as exposed to LPS (ECV-LPS), while the suppression of migration and proliferation was observed in the subline exposed to high virus doses (ECV-1000ID). In the ECV-1ID, ECV-LPS, and most notably in ECV-1ID \u002B LPS sublines, we detected an increase in the expression of mRNA for cytokines TNF\u03B1 and TGF\u03B2, which, however, didn\u2019t lead to the induction of apoptosis. We have also demonstrated an increase in cell permeability in the analyzed sublines, which was indicated by a decrease in the expression of the mRNAs for the genes encoding occludin and ZO-1, the tight junctions proteins . This paper also reports an evaluation of the effects of the antiviral preparations rimantadine and alpisarin on the functional state of cell sublines. As a result, it has been demonstrated that these drugs may be able to prevent the development of the pathological changes caused by influenza A virus and/or LPS in endothelial cells.

Here, we studied which molecular cardiac alterations are initiated after this treatment. Transcription profiling of endomyocardial biopsies with Affymetrix whole genome arrays was performed on 33 paired samples of DCM patients collected before and 6 months after IA/IgG. Therapy-related effects on myocardial protein levels were analysed by label-free proteome profiling for a subset of 23 DCM patients. Data were analysed regarding therapy-associated differences in gene expression and protein levels by comparing responders (defined by improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction \u226520 % relative and \u22655 % absolute) and non-responders. Responders to IA/IgG showed a decrease in serum N-terminal proBNP levels in comparison with baseline which was accompanied by a decreased expression of heart failure markers, such as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or periostin. However, despite clinical improvement even in responders, IA/IgG did not trigger general inversion of DCM-associated molecular alterations in myocardial tissue. Transcriptome profiling revealed reduced gene expression for connective tissue growth factor, fibronectin, and collagen type I in responders. In contrast, in non-responders after IA/IgG, fibrosis-associated genes and proteins showed elevated levels, whereas values were reduced or maintained in responders. Thus, improvement of LV function after IA/IgG seems to be related to a reduced gene expression of heart failure markers and pro-fibrotic molecules as well as reduced fibrosis progression.

Although its etiopathogenesis is not clearly understood, it is known to be a Nairovirus. We aimed to examine the viral effects of intense systemic inflammation and vascular damage on the pulmonary vascular beds and lung tissues. METHODS: A total of 45 patients who were diagnosed with CCHF were considered for this retrospective study. In this patient group, those whose lungs had been visualized via thoracic computer tomography (CT) were entered into the study. Diameters of the pulmonary trunk, main pulmonary arteries, atria, and ventricles were measured. Study group measurements were compared with the control group, which included patients with normal thoracic CT. RESULTS: Overall, 90 patients were enrolled in the study, with 45 patients in the study group and 45 in the control group. In the study group, the man-to-woman balance was 3/2. The average age in the study group was 54.07 \u00B1 17.91 years. In comparing the average diameters of pulmonary arteries in the study and control groups, the study group\u2019s average pulmonary artery diameter was significantly larger than the control group (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in diameters of the pulmonary trunks and main pulmonary arteries due to CCHF was first shown in this current study. Moreover, due to our findings, it should be noted that with the rise in pulmonary artery diameter in CCHF, pulmonary hypertension can appear acutely, and this condition can be significantly alter clinical course and follow-up of the viral illness.","publish_time":"2016-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akta\u015F, Turan; Akta\u015F, Fatma; \u00D6zmen, Zafer; Kaya, Turan","journal":"Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/908229b89e229ffa5e16a89b13a05d843b784bbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101793.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101793/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCHF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Study group measurements","retrospective study","current study","pulmonary trunks","pulmonary hypertension","main pulmonary arteries","average diameters of pulmonary arteries","study group\u2019s average pulmonary artery diameter","patient group","pulmonary vascular beds","CCHF","patients","control groups","viral illness","average age","viral tick-borne illness","vascular damage","viral effects of intense systemic inflammation","thoracic computer tomography","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever","atria","clinical course","PURPOSE","follow-up","lungs","lung tissues","increase","RESULTS","rise","ventricles","woman balance","condition","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","total","years","findings","etiopathogenesis","Nairovirus"],"language":"en"},

However, S. aureus might exhibit fluctuating blood culture positivity, labeled as \u201Cthe skip phenomenon\u201D. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of the skip phenomenon in a cohort of hospitalized patients with S. aureus bacteremia and to determine the associated clinical variables. METHODS: We conducted a nested case\u2013control study, using a previous cohort of 757 adult inpatients between July 2006 and June 2011 with \u2265 3 days of S. aureus bacteremia. Each case of S. aureus bacteremia with the skip phenomenon was matched to 2 to 4 controls based on age, gender, and duration of bacteremia. The association of clinical characteristics with the skip phenomenon was analyzed via conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 757 patients in the cohort, 29 (4%) had the skip phenomenon. 26 (90%) patients in the cases group were male. The median age was 69.4 years (interquartile range [IQR] 58.7 to 80.3). Although an attempt to match for the duration of bacteremia was done, there was a statistically longer duration in patients with cases as compared to that in controls (median [IQR], 10 [7\u201312] days, vs 8 [6\u201310] days; P = 0.015). Accordingly, duration of bacteremia was adjusted for in regression models. Notably, 26 (90%) patients in the case group were receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapy, as compared to 69 (79%) patients in the control group (P = 0.427). CONCLUSION: Our findings prompt consideration of a practice chance to obtain serial negative blood cultures to ensure clearance of bacteremia among patients with S. aureus bacteremia.

On the other hand, excessive and inappropriate NO synthesis in inflammation and sepsis has been implicated in vascular abnormalities and cell injury. At least three different NOS isoforms (neuronal/brain [bNOS], inducible [iNOS], and endothelial [eNOS]) have been described, which are all expressed in normal lung tissue. We investigated the cell-specific expression of bNOS, iNOS, and eNOS in perfused control rat lungs and lungs undergoing stimulation with endotoxin in the presence and absence of plasma constituents. Lung immunohistochemistry and quantitative evaluation of staining intensity showed endotoxin-induced increase in iNOS expression in particular in bronchial epithelial cells, cells of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), alveolar macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. In endothelial cells, which did not express iNOS at baseline, newly induced iNOS was found in response to endotoxin. In contrast, expression of eNOS was markedly suppressed under endotoxin challenge, particularly in bronchial epithelium, BALT, and alveolar macrophages but also in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. eNOS expression in bronchial smooth muscle cells was not altered. In contrast to iNOS and eNOS, cellular expression of bNOS in epithelial cells, nerve fibers, BALT, and endothelial cells did not change in response to endotoxin. All changes in NOS regulation were found to be independent of plasma constituents. We conclude that endotoxin exerts a profound impact on the cell-specific NOS regulation in a large number of lung cell types. Prominent features include de novo synthesis or up-regulation of iNOS, in contrast to down-regulation of eNOS, which may well contribute to vascular abnormalities, inflammatory sequelae, and loss of physiologic functions in septic lung failure.","publish_time":"2002-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ermert, Monika; Ruppert, Clemens; G\u00FCnther, Andreas; Duncker, Hans-Rainer; Seeger, Werner; Ermert, Leander","journal":"Lab Invest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8ffb0a45fc947a339bf6c2c008cc7f8202924a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102244.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endothelial cells","iNOS expression","regulation of iNOS","expression of eNOS","eNOS expression","regulation of eNOS","bronchial epithelial cells","vascular smooth muscle cells","regulation of vascular","bronchial smooth muscle cells","induced iNOS","express iNOS","cell-specific NOS regulation","vascular abnormalities","cell-specific expression of bNOS","endotoxin challenge","cellular expression of bNOS","physiologic lung functions","BALT","Lung immunohistochemistry","endotoxin-induced increase","contrast","normal lung tissue","bronchial epithelium","bronchial tone","cell injury","large number of lung cell types","septic lung failure","alveolar macrophages","different NOS isoforms","response","loss of physiologic functions","absence of plasma constituents","independent of plasma constituents","novo synthesis","lymphoid tissue","perfused control rat lungs","time","quantitative evaluation of staining intensity","nerve fibers","stimulation","brain","bronchus","inflammatory sequelae","sepsis","presence","ubiquitous mediator molecule","profound impact","inflammation","immunocompetence","baseline","dose-dependent fashion","Prominent features","hand","changes","Nitric oxide","synthase"],"language":"en"},

Following intravenous infusion of DSCs (1 \u00D7 10(6)/kg/infusion), the first patient could elevate his arms to the facial level. He experienced recurrent paralysis after 6 months, and the efficacy of four additional DSC infusions, at subsequent occasions, were limited and transient. The second patient was treated with two doses of DSCs (1 \u00D7 10(6)/kg/infusion). After cell infusion, she was able to stand on one leg, sensation in the belly normalized, and she was discharged. These two cases suggest that DSCs may be useful in the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sadeghi, Behnam; Ersmark, Bo; Moretti, Gianluca; Mattsson, Jonas; Ringd\u00E9n, Olle","journal":"Int J Hematol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1110b88903bfb2d529fdae6076b71b9cf27b605a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102257.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mesenchymal"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intravenous infusion of DSCs","use of DSCs","doses of DSCs","cell infusion","months","radiculomyelopathy","arms","Mesenchymal stromal cells","year old man","year old woman","placenta-derived decidua stromal cells","acute inflammatory disorders","treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","hemolysis","impaired sensorium","subsequent occasions","additional DSC infusions","arcus","irradiation","parotidectomy","difficulty","efficacy","graft","feto-maternal tolerance","host disease","leg","lymphoma","C4","patients","anti-inflammatory effect","sensation","belly","neck","ambulation","facial level","Yersinia infection","C3","recurrent paralysis","cases"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to our institution with H1N1 infection was carried out from July to November 2009. Renal biochemistry, need for renal replacement therapy and hospital outcome was recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with H1N1 were admitted. Average length of admission was 10 days (3\u201384). Eleven patients (32%) developed acute kidney injury (AKI) as defined by the RIFLE criteria (creatinine range 120\u2013610). Four patients required renal replacement therapy, for a range of 10\u201352 days. Seven patients developed AKI that responded to volume resuscitation. The commonest cause of AKI was sepsis with acute tubular necrosis.

The disorder is most commonly associated with gynecological and breast carcinomas, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and Hodgkin\u2019s disease and in most cases comes on prior to identification of the underlying neoplasm. The hallmark of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is the presence of an immune response reactive with intracellular proteins of Purkinje or other neurons or, less commonly, against neuronal surface antigens. Evidence-based treatment strategies for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration do not exist; and approaches to therapy are thus speculative. Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying neoplasm is critical, and characterization of the antibody response involved may assist in tumor diagnosis. Most investigators have initiated treatment with corticosteroids, plasma exchange, or intravenous immunoglobulin G. Cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, rituximab, or possibly mycophenolate mofetil may warrant consideration in patients who fail to stabilize or improve on less aggressive therapies. Plasma exchange has been of questionable benefit when used alone but should be considered at initiation of treatment to achieve rapid lowering of circulating paraneoplastic autoantibodies. Because the course of illness is one of relentless neuronal destruction, time is of the essence in initiating treatment. Likelihood of clinical improvement in patients with longstanding symptoms and extensive neuronal loss is poor.","publish_time":"2013-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greenlee, John E.","journal":"Curr Treat Options Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a6b687d023fd8f2a41748d459fe3dd051af2694.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102346.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102346/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["G.

Sixty-eight patients with inflammatory CNS diseases and 30 healthy volunteers were included in this prospective observational cohort study. The observational period was between January 2005 and May 2009. The CO(2) R was measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound using the breath-holding method. We compared patients with normal CO(2) R (breath-holding index [BHI(m)] \u2265 1.18 = BHI(N) group) with patients who showed impaired CO(2) R (BHI(m) \u003C 1.18 = BHI(R) group). We also analyzed the association of impaired CO(2) R with the etiology, severity, and outcome of disease. When compared to the BHI(N) group, the patients from the BHI(R) group were older, had a heavier consciousness disturbance, experienced more frequent respiratory failure, and, subsequently, had worse outcomes. There were no fatalities among the 28 patients in the BHI(N) group. The comparison of subjects with bacterial and non-bacterial meningitis revealed no significant differences. The unfavorable outcome of disease (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score 1\u20133) was significantly more common in subjects with impaired CO(2) R (62.5% vs. 10.7%). Logistic regression analysis was performed in order to establish the prognostic value of BHI(m). The outcome variable was unfavorable outcome (GOS 1\u20133), while the independent variables were age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and BHI(m). The age and BHI(m) showed the strongest influence on disease outcome. A decrease of BHI(m) for each 0.1 unit increased the risk of unfavorable outcome by 17%. Our study emphasizes the importance of CO(2) R assessment in patients with inflammatory CNS diseases.","publish_time":"2011-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lepur, D.; Kutle\u0161a, M.; Bar\u0161i\u0107, B.","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0fdfd83a3b81c433cc4253808aeb0f76f22e6952.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102361/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["cerebrovascular CO","CNS","The CO","TCD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","decrease of BHI","disease outcome","group","R assessment","unfavorable outcome of disease","outcome variable","prognostic value of BHI","Glasgow Outcome Scale","risk of unfavorable outcome","inflammatory CNS diseases","outcome of inflammatory central nervous system","score","GOS","age","breath","association of impaired","prospective observational cohort study","Glasgow Coma Scale","comparison of subjects","observational period","GCS","non-bacterial meningitis","heavier consciousness disturbance","healthy volunteers","order","ultrasound","course","independent variables","frequent respiratory failure","TCD","transcranial Doppler","severity","significant differences","strongest influence","Logistic regression analysis","unit","etiology","index","significance of cerebrovascular","method","reactivity","importance","worse outcomes","purpose","fatalities"],"language":"en"},

Blood samples were collected from 20 male and female calves via jugular vein catheters every 15 min for 6 hr at Days 3, 9, and 21 of life. The animals were classified into three groups. Group 1 (controls): healthy calves (n = 9). Group 2: calves affected with diarrhea at Day 9 (n = 7). Group 3: calves with diarrhea at Days 3 and 9 (n = 4). Infections occurred spontaneously and were mainly due to E. coli infections. All affected calves had recovered at Day 21. Mean GH concentrations in the calves in Groups 2 and 3 compared to control calves had increased by Day 3 (P \u003C 0.01; P \u003C 0.001). Cortisol levels of calves in all groups were highest at Day 3 and decreased thereafter (P \u003C 0.001). Cortisol concentrations were lower at Day 3 in animals in Groups 2 (P \u003C 0.001) and 3 (P \u003C 0.05) than in controls. Pulsatile LH release was detectable at Days 9 and 21 only in healthy calves. Insulin increased at Day 9 during diarrhea. The results indicate that cortisol concentrations decreased whereas GH concentrations were increased before diarrhea was observed. The onset of pulsatile LH release was delayed in diarrheic calves. It is concluded that diarrhea exerts effects upon the release of reproductive and metabolic hormones in early postnatal calves.","publish_time":"2000-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Br\u00FCckmann, A.; H\u00F6ck, C.; Linke, K.; Hennies, M.; Schallenberger, E.","journal":"Domest Anim Endocrinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0440e70beeefb9c36921bb8032ac02816f3c27a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127462.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739724099000788; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0739724099000788","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diarrheic calves","healthy calves","affected calves","female calves","control calves","early postnatal calves","Cortisol levels of calves","diarrhea","early postnatal phase of calves","Cortisol concentrations","groups","concentrations of hormones","Days","Mean GH concentrations","release of reproductive","onset of pulsatile LH release","influence of diarrheic infections","animals","controls","coli infections","metabolic hormones","jugular vein catheters","reproduction","metabolism","effects","study","Blood samples","hr","results","Insulin","aim","life"],"language":"en"},

However, diagnostic criteria for AB are heterogeneous and not very well known. Objective To identify the diagnostic criteria for AB used by experts and clinical paediatricians in Spain. Methods Delphi study with Spanish AB experts, looking for the points of agreement about AB diagnosis. A subsequent cross-sectional study was conducted by means of an online questionnaire addressed to all Spanish paediatricians, reached through electronic mail messages sent by nine paediatric scientific societies. Descriptive and factorial analyses were carried out, looking for any association of diagnostic criteria with demographic or geographic variables, or with paediatric subspecialty. Results Agreement was reached by 40 experts in many issues (first episode of respiratory distress and high respiratory frequency, diagnosis in any season of the year, and usefulness of virus identification in making diagnosis), but opposite views were maintained on key characteristics such as the maximum age for diagnosis. The online questionnaire was completed by 1297 paediatricians. Their diagnostic criteria were heterogeneous and strongly associated with their paediatric sub-specialty. Their agreement with the Spanish expert consensus and with international standards was very poor. Conclusions Diagnostic criteria for AB in Spain are heterogeneous. These differences could cause variability in clinical practice with AB patients.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cano-Garcinu\u00F1o, Alfredo; Praena-Crespo, Manuel; Mora-Gandarillas, Isabel; Carvajal-Urue\u00F1a, Ignacio; Call\u00E9n-Blecua, Mar\u00EDa Teresa; Garc\u00EDa-Merino, \u00C1gueda; Calvo, Cristina; Cansino-Campuzano, \u00C1ngeles; Flores-Gonz\u00E1lez, Jos\u00E9 Carlos; Gaboli, Mirella; Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, Mar\u00EDa Luz; Garc\u00EDa-Marcos, Luis; Gim\u00E9nez-S\u00E1nchez, Francisco; Dios, Javier Gonz\u00E1lez de; Gonz\u00E1lez P\u00E9rez-Yarza, Eduardo; Korta-Murua, Javier; L\u00F3pez-Fern\u00E1ndez, Yolanda M.; Luaces-Cubells, Carles; Mart\u00EDnez S\u00E1enz de Jubera, Jorge; Martin\u00F3n-Torres, Federico; Moreno-Sol\u00EDs, Gloria M.; Naharro-Fern\u00E1ndez, Cristina; Ochoa-Sangrador, Carlos; Oliver-Goicolea, Pablo; O\u00F1oro, Gonzalo; Orej\u00F3n de Luna, Gloria; Pellegrini-Belinch\u00F3n, Francisco Javier; P\u00E9rez-Moreno, Jimena; Pilar-Orive, Javier; Plaza-Almeida, Josefa; Pons-\u00D3dena, Mart\u00ED; Ramos-Fern\u00E1ndez, Jos\u00E9 Miguel; Rey-Gal\u00E1n, Corsino; Ricart-Campos, Silvia; Rivas-Juesas, Cristina; Rueda-Esteban, Santiago; S\u00E1nchez-Etxaniz, Jes\u00FAs; S\u00E1nchez-Luna, Manuel; S\u00E1nchez-Sol\u00EDs de Querol, Manuel; Sim\u00F3-Nebot, Marta","journal":"Anales de Pediatr\u00EDa (English Edition)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f7671868f71e4f374d0366bc4f5b11c17929cca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146771.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289044/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2341287918302230; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2341287918302230; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpede.2018.07.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Delphi"],"organizations":["AB"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["AB diagnosis","Spanish AB experts","AB patients","Conclusions Diagnostic criteria","association of diagnostic criteria","Spanish paediatricians","clinical paediatricians","Spain","paediatric subspecialty","points of agreement","Results Agreement","online questionnaire","episode of respiratory distress","high respiratory frequency","Spanish expert consensus","common respiratory diseases","paediatric scientific societies","paediatric sub-specialty","clinical practice","Methods Delphi study","subsequent cross-sectional study","geographic variables","electronic mail messages","key characteristics","international standards","year","Abstract Introduction Acute viral bronchiolitis","variability","season","usefulness of virus identification","opposite views","maximum age","issues","differences","infants","factorial analyses","Objective"],"language":"en"},

However, the systematic workflow evaluation on clinical respiratory samples and implementation of quality controls (QCs) is still lacking. METHODS: A total of 3 QCs were implemented and processed through the whole mNGS workflow: a no-template-control to evaluate contamination issues during the process; an internal and an external QC to check the integrity of the reagents, equipment, the presence of inhibitors, and to allow the validation of results for each sample. The workflow was then evaluated on 37 clinical respiratory samples from patients with acute respiratory infections previously tested for a broad panel of viruses using semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays (28 positive samples including 6 multiple viral infections; 9 negative samples). Selected specimens included nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 20), aspirates (n = 10), or sputums (n = 7). RESULTS: The optimal spiking level of the internal QC was first determined in order to be sufficiently detected without overconsumption of sequencing reads. According to QC validation criteria, mNGS results were validated for 34/37 selected samples. For valid samples, viral genotypes were accurately determined for 36/36 viruses detected with PCR (viral genome coverage ranged from 0.6 to 100%, median = 67.7%). This mNGS workflow allowed the detection of DNA and RNA viruses up to a semi-quantitative PCR Ct value of 36. The six multiple viral infections involving 2 to 4 viruses were also fully characterized. A strong correlation between results of mNGS and real-time PCR was obtained for each type of viral genome (R(2) ranged from 0.72 for linear single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses to 0.98 for linear ssDNA viruses). CONCLUSIONS: Although the potential of mNGS technology is very promising, further evaluation studies are urgently needed for its routine clinical use within a reasonable timeframe. The approach described herein is crucial to bring standardization and to ensure the quality of the generated sequences in clinical setting. We provide an easy-to-use single protocol successfully evaluated for the characterization of a broad and representative panel of DNA and RNA respiratory viruses in various types of clinical samples.

Objectives To study the epidemiology and seasonality of viral respiratory infections in hospitalized children (under the age of 16) between September 2012 and August 2016. Study design Nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates were collected from 3199 symptomatic patients and then screened with a routine multiplex PCR assay. Results Respiratory viruses were detected for 1624 (50.8%) of the 3199 children in the study population. Of these, 210 (13.3%) were positive for two viruses, 28 (1.7%) were positive for three, and 3 (0.2%) were positive for four. The viral profile varied with age. Some viruses were significantly more frequent in children under the age of 1 month (such as human respiratory syncytial virus (p \u003C 0.0001)), whereas others were significantly more frequent in children over that age (such as influenza viruses (p \u003C 0.0001) and adenoviruses (p = .0006)). The distribution of viruses is variable over the year depending on the species. However, the atmospheric temperature was rarely found to be a limiting factor in the circulation of respiratory viruses. Conclusions our results constitute a detailed description of the distribution of respiratory viruses among hospitalized children over four consecutive years. Our data notably highlight the persistence of non-enveloped viruses and some enveloped viruses throughout the year\u2013regardless of temperature variations.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fillatre, Adrien; Fran\u00E7ois, Catherine; Segard, Christine; Duverlie, Gilles; Hecquet, Denise; Pannier, Christine; Roussel, Catherine; Zawadzki, Patricia; Brochot, Etienne; Castelain, Sandrine","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46da94511ee8c9857849203e556f7ed7254a7f64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106524.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29477833/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321830043X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321830043X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.02.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distribution of respiratory viruses","distribution of viruses","circulation of respiratory viruses","influenza viruses","hospitalized children","age","young children","persistence of non-enveloped viruses","seasonality of viral respiratory infections","human respiratory syncytial virus","Abstract Background Acute respiratory infections","study population","results","viral profile","Study design Nasopharyngeal swabs","temperature variations","atmospheric temperature","principal cause of illness","aspirates","detailed description","mortality","epidemiology","month","limiting factor","consecutive years","routine multiplex PCR assay","Conclusions","symptomatic patients","data","Objectives","adenoviruses","species"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A national sample of 1720 community dwelling adults of age 18 and older were surveyed by individual visits during April 2005. Demographics, state of influenza vaccination, reasons for vaccination or non-vaccination and perceptions on vaccinations were asked by questionnaire. RESULTS: Influenza vaccination coverage in general population and high risk group was 34.3% and 61.3%, respectively. Predictors for vaccination were \u226565 of age, performance of regular exercise, vaccination in the previous season, experience of influenza-like illness, belief that vaccine can prevent common cold and opinion that vaccine must be taken annually. The most common reason for vaccination for both whole population and high risk groups was to prevent both influenza and common cold, while the most common reason for non-vaccination was the thought that he/she was healthy enough not to be in need for vaccination. Having more information on influenza and vaccination as well as doctor\u0027s recommendation for vaccination appeared to be the most important modus operandi to encourage influenza vaccination among non-vaccinees. CONCLUSIONS: Doctor\u0027s recommendation was the most important factor in encouraging people to be vaccinated against influenza. Doctors should be geared up with precise information and actively encourage high risk population in order to increase vaccination coverage.","publish_time":"2007-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kee, Sae Yoon; Lee, Jin Soo; Cheong, Hee Jin; Chun, Byung Chul; Song, Joon Young; Choi, Won Suk; Jo, Yu Mi; Seo, Yoo Bin; Kim, Woo Joo","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d49dc41efa46478178d1761392994bd09e20b3ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132372.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445307006287; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445307006287","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-vaccination","Influenza vaccination coverage","vaccination interventions","state of influenza vaccination","experience of influenza","level of influenza vaccine coverage","high risk population","common reason","general population","Korean population","high risk groups","non-vaccinees","doctor\u0027s recommendation","important factor","precise information","community dwelling adults of age","reasons","previous season","national sample","performance of regular exercise","following year","barriers","belief","perceptions","order","driving forces","encouraging people","illness","vaccinations","thought","opinion","RESULTS","Demographics","survey","individual visits","METHODS","questionnaire","CONCLUSIONS","need","OBJECTIVE","Doctors","Predictors"],"language":"en"},

Time-directed paths or \u2018contact chains\u0027 provide a measure of host-connectedness across specified timeframes, and so represent potential pathways for spread of infections with different epidemiological characteristics. We analysed networks and contact chains of cattle farms in Great Britain using Cattle Tracing System data from 2001 to 2015.

Networks were characterized by scale-free type properties, where individual farms were found to be influential \u2018hubs\u0027 in the network. We found a markedly bimodal distribution of farms with either small or very large ingoing and outgoing contact chains (ICCs and OCCs). As a result of their cattle purchases within 12-month periods, 47% of British farms were connected by ICCs to more than 1000 other farms and 16% were connected to more than 10 000 other farms. As a result of their cattle sales within 12-month periods, 66% of farms had OCCs that reached more than 1000 other farms and 15% reached more than 10 000 other farms. Over 19 000 farms had both ICCs and OCCs reaching more than 10 000 farms for two or more years.

While developed countries easily adapt their well-organized routine laboratory services, resource-limited countries need considerable capacity building as many gaps still exist. In this paper, we discuss some of the efforts made by the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) in supporting laboratory capacity development in the Africa region. The efforts range from promoting graduate level training programs to building advanced technical, managerial and leadership skills to in-service short course training for peripheral laboratory staff. A number of specific projects focus on external quality assurance, basic laboratory information systems, strengthening laboratory management towards accreditation, equipment calibration, harmonization of training materials, networking and provision of pre-packaged laboratory kits to support outbreak investigation. Available evidence indicates a positive effect of these efforts on laboratory capacity in the region. However, many opportunities exist, especially to support the roll-out of these projects as well as attending to some additional critical areas such as biosafety and biosecuity. We conclude that AFENET\u2019s approach of strengthening national and sub-national systems provide a model that could be adopted in resource-limited settings such as sub-Saharan Africa.","publish_time":"2010-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masanza, Monica Musenero; Nqobile, Ndlovu; Mukanga, David; Gitta, Sheba Nakacubo","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9df9c07c5571ea37b99d01b8ecbfcac5625fa1ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3005580.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21143830/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-s1-s8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["laboratory management","laboratory capacity development","peripheral laboratory staff","basic laboratory information systems","well-organized routine laboratory services","provision of pre-packaged laboratory kits","resource-limited countries","considerable capacity building","efforts range","Africa region","harmonization of training materials","sub-national systems","resource-limited settings","in-service short course training","graduate level training programs","sub-Saharan Africa","number of specific projects","leadership skills","external quality assurance","networking","equipment calibration","accreditation","key processes of detection","positive effect","notification","response","assessment","African Field Epidemiology Network","major role","additional critical areas","International Health Regulations","attending","implementation","IHR","outbreak investigation","model","AFENET\u2019s approach","biosecuity","Available evidence","gaps","core capacities","monitoring of events","roll","paper","opportunities"],"language":"en"},

Nuclear and cytoplasmic purified hCLE-associated factors were identified and proteins involved in mRNA metabolism, motor-related proteins, cytoskeletal and translation-related factors were found. Purified hCLE complexes also contain RNAs and as expected some hCLE-interacting proteins (DDX1, HSPC117, FAM98B) were found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, endogenous hCLE fractionates in protein complexes together with DDX1, HSPC117 and FAM98B and silencing of hCLE down-regulates their nuclear and cytosolic accumulation levels. Using a photoactivatable hCLE-GFP protein, nuclear import and export of hCLE was observed indicating that hCLE is a shuttling protein. Interestingly, hCLE nuclear import required active transcription, as did the import of DDX1, HSPC117 and FAM98B proteins. The data indicate that hCLE probably as a complex with DDX1, HSPC117 and FAM98B shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm transporting RNAs suggesting that this complex has a prominent role on nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fate.","publish_time":"2014-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rez-Gonz\u00E1lez, Alicia; Pazo, Alejandra; Navajas, Rosana; Ciordia, Sergio; Rodriguez-Frandsen, Ariel; Nieto, Amelia","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c4dfdf8ee6230324845b917be55c47d1e991f2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3946611.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608264/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hCLE nuclear import","hCLE complexes","export of hCLE","silencing of hCLE","endogenous hCLE","nuclear RNA metabolism","photoactivatable hCLE-GFP protein","cytoplasmic purified hCLE-associated factors","cytoplasmic protein","HSPC117","FAM98B proteins","import of DDX1","cytoplasmic RNA granules","cytoplasmic RNA fate","protein complexes","nucleus","FAM98B shuttles","shuttling protein","motor-related proteins","sequential phases of RNA metabolism","mRNA metabolism","translation-related factors","RNAs","localized translation","prominent role","active transcription","RNAP","participation","C14orf166","common interactors","light","cytosolic accumulation levels","data"],"language":"en"},

By co-cultivation of peripheral leukocytes of a BLV-infected cow with a permanent sheep kidney cell line, a new BLV-producing cell line named PO714 was established. This line carries a BLV provirus of the Belgian species and has been tested to be free of a variety of possibly contaminating viruses and mycoplasms. Investigations of a panel of well-characterised sera by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and capture ELISA (cELISA) tests using antigen prepared from this new cell line in comparison with antigen of the well-known cell line FLK/BLV yielded comparable results.

Consistent with this observation, pharmacological inhibitors of PI4KB blocked entry of SARS pseudovirions. Further research suggested that PI4P plays an essential role in SARS-CoV spike-mediated entry, which is regulated by the PI4P lipid microenvironment.

It also provides general principles of diagnostic virology. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses require cell in which to replicate. The cells must express appropriate receptors and other proteins required by the virus. Cultured cells are often used to study basic steps in virus replication. Viruses can be purified away from cellular proteins and organelles using centrifugation techniques. Most viruses cannot be seen using standard light microscopes, but are often imaged using electron microscopy. Methods that combine image collection and computationally demanding image processing can provide incredible details about virus architecture. Another common way to visualize viruses is to use fluorescent tags or dyes. Although these techniques do not show detailed virus structures, they can be used to follow the progress of a virus through a cell and can provide a direct window into protein\u2013protein interactions required for virus replication. A more indirect method to detect viruses is to look for virally induced changes to cell morphology. A variety of basic biochemical techniques are useful for analyzing viral proteins and nucleic acids. As the viral genomes are relatively simple, they can be manipulated/mutated to study the function of virtually any viral protein. Powerful genetic techniques can also be used to generate \u201Cdesigner\u201D cells or organisms. There are a variety of methods for quantitating viruses. Infectivity assays measure the ability of a virus to productively infect a cell. Techniques that identify specific viral proteins or genomes provide ways to rapidly identify viruses. Some of these assays can be used at the bedside, or in the field. Powerful and inexpensive DNA sequencing technologies are being used to identify new viruses, many of which could not be found by other methods. The challenge is to understand how or if these viruses impact their hosts.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Payne, Susan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90c2593dd1d75be9f4e9dd22dd95d633b354ce81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149989.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128031094000040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128031094000040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quantitating viruses","new viruses","characterizing viruses","virus replication","virus architecture","specific viral proteins","centrifugation techniques","viral genomes","detailed virus structures","variety of methods","Powerful genetic techniques","cellular proteins","variety of basic biochemical techniques","cell morphology","protein interactions","Cultured cells","image collection","basic steps","Infectivity assays","demanding image processing","incredible details","direct window","ways","inexpensive DNA sequencing technologies","organelles","obligate intracellular parasites","induced changes","nucleic acids","general principles of diagnostic virology","fluorescent tags","ability","appropriate receptors","standard light microscopes","dyes","bedside","designer","organisms","common way","indirect method","function","progress","electron microscopy","field","chapter","hosts","challenge"],"language":"en"},

In an effort to determine which viral proteins might be determinants of enterotropism, immunoblots of MHV-Y and MHV-RI virions using anti-S, -N and -M protein-specific antisera were performed. The uncleaved MHV-Y and MHV-RI S proteins migrated slightly faster than the MHV-A59 S protein. The MHV-Y S protein was inefficiently cleaved. The MHV-Y, MHV-RI and MHV-A59 N and M proteins showed only minor differences in their migration. The S genes of MHV-Y and MHV-RI were cloned, sequenced and found to encode 1361 and 1376 amino acid long proteins, respectively. The presence of several amino acids changes upstream from the predicted cleavage site of the MHV-Y S protein may contribute its inefficient cleavage. A high degree of homology was found between the MHV-RI and MHV-4 S proteins, whereas the homology between the MHV-Y S protein and the S proteins of other MHV strains was much lower. These results indicate that the enterotropism of MHV-RI and MHV-Y may be determined by different amino acid changes in the S protein and/or by changes in other viral proteins.","publish_time":"1995-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kunita, Satoshi; Zhang, Linong; Homberger, Felix R.; Compton, Susan R.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99957cafff6d3a60cbeb20a032395e2dd4f25d21.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016817029400089U; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016817029400089U","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV strains","MHV-Y S protein","enterotropism of MHV","MHV-RI S proteins","S genes of MHV","uncleaved MHV-Y","MHV-A59 S protein","MHV-RI virions","MHV-A59 N","anti-S","viral proteins","amino acid long proteins","protein-specific antisera","different amino acid changes","amino acids","prototypic respiratory strains of murine coronaviruses","Abstract Enterotropic strains of murine coronaviruses","determinants of enterotropism","inefficient cleavage","predicted cleavage site","high degree of homology","pathogenesis","minor differences","migration","presence","effort","results"],"language":"en"},

However, there is no safe and efficacious RSV vaccine or antiviral treatment. Toll Like Receptors (TLR) are important molecular mediators linking innate and adaptive immunity, and their stimulation by cognate agonists has been explored as antiviral agents. Imiquimod is known as a TLR7 agonist, but additionally acts as an antagonist for adenosine receptors. In this study, we demonstrate that imiquimod, but not resiquimod, has direct anti-RSV activity via PKA pathway in HEp-2 and A549 cells, independently of an innate response. Imiquimod restricts RSV infection after viral entry into the host cell, interfering with viral RNA and protein synthesis. Probably as a consequence of these anti-RSV properties, imiquimod displays cytokine modulating activity in RSV infected epithelial cells. Moreover, in a murine model of RSV infection, imiquimod treatment improves the course of acute disease, evidenced by decreased weight loss, reduced RSV lung titers, and attenuated airway inflammation. Consequently, imiquimod represents a promising therapeutic alternative against RSV infection and may inform the development of novel therapeutic targets to control RSV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salinas, Franco Maximiliano; Nebreda, Antonela D\u00EDaz; V\u00E1zquez, Luciana; Gentilini, Mar\u00EDa Virginia; Marini, Victoria; Benedetti, Martina; Nabaes Jodar, Mercedes Soledad; Viegas, Mariana; Shayo, Carina; Bueno, Carlos Alberto","journal":"Antiviral Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33d14ff5ca29615978c7925403da22600922f9b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202858.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635422030231X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387475/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104817; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635422030231X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PKA","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV pathogenesis","anti-RSV properties","efficacious RSV vaccine","imiquimod treatment","direct anti-RSV activity","murine model of RSV infection","RSV infected epithelial cells","reduced RSV lung titers","antiviral treatment","important cause of morbidity","leading cause of lower respiratory tract disease","viral entry","viral RNA","A549 cells","innate response","antiviral agents","adenosine receptors","important molecular mediators","course of acute disease","promising therapeutic alternative","development of novel therapeutic targets","Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus","cytokine","weight loss","PKA pathway","adaptive immunity","mortality","host cell","attenuated airway inflammation","bronchiolitis","children","resiquimod","stimulation","cognate agonists","immunocompromised individuals","protein synthesis","consequence","antagonist","Toll","TLR7 agonist","study"],"language":"en"},

Its role in respiratory diseases was questioned after the detection of its DNA in clinical samples taken from patients suffering from pneumonia or bronchiolitis. To better define the role of Waddlia in both miscarriage and pneumonia, a tool allowing large-scale serological investigations of Waddlia seropositivity is needed. Therefore, enriched outer membrane proteins of W. chondrophila were used as antigens to develop a specific ELISA. After thorough analytical optimization, the ELISA was validated by comparison with micro-immunofluorescence and it showed a sensitivity above 85% with 100% specificity. The ELISA was subsequently applied to human sera to specify the role of W. chondrophila in pneumonia. Overall, 3.6% of children showed antibody reactivity against W. chondrophila but no significant difference was observed between children with and without pneumonia. Proteomic analyses were then performed using mass spectrometry, highlighting members of the outer membrane protein family as the dominant proteins. The major Waddlia putative immunogenic proteins were identified by immunoblot using positive and negative human sera. The new ELISA represents an efficient tool with high throughput applications. Although no association with pneumonia and Waddlia seropositivity was observed, this ELISA could be used to specify the role of W. chondrophila in miscarriage and in other diseases.","publish_time":"2014-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lienard, J; Croxatto, A; Gervaix, A; Posfay-Barbe, K; Baud, D; Kebbi-Beghdadi, C; Greub, G","journal":"New Microbes New Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a25eeb43c5f7e8143b16c6237093f2156b3cef60.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0e26889f9cffa6531cfef5b27d1f09734d98333f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4184618.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S205229751450042X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25356333/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S205229751450042X; https://doi.org/10.1002/2052-2975.26","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Waddlia chondrophila","pneumonia","role of Waddlia","new ELISA","specific ELISA","outer membrane proteins","major Waddlia putative immunogenic proteins","large-scale serological investigations of Waddlia seropositivity","dominant proteins","children","likely cause of miscarriage","negative human sera","efficient tool","outer membrane protein family","respiratory diseases","members","obligate intracellular bacterium","detection","patients","Chlamydiales order","clinical samples","agent of bovine abortion","high throughput applications","DNA","mass spectrometry","micro-immunofluorescence","antibody reactivity","significant difference","humans","comparison","antigens","association","Proteomic analyses","sensitivity","analytical optimization","bronchiolitis","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Objectives Our objective was to investigate whether deficient antibiotics knowledge could contribute to nonadherence in a community with high prevalence of antibiotics resistance. Methods We recruited 465 people by random sampling from 5 urban areas in Hong Kong. A structured questionnaire was used to assess antibiotics knowledge and adherence. Adherence was defined as completing the most recent course of antibiotics entirely according to physicians\u2019 instructions. An antibiotics knowledge score ranging from 0 to 3 (highest) was composed based on the number of correctly answered questions. Results Of the 465 participants interviewed, 96.3% had heard of the term \u201Cantibiotics,\u201D and 80.6% recalled having previously received antibiotics prescription. Among the eligible 369 subjects, 32.9% showed nonadherence. Percentages of participants with antibiotics knowledge scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 were 11%, 27%, 33%, and 29%, respectively. There was a higher prevalence of nonadherence among people with lower antibiotics knowledge score (P \u003C .001). Furthermore, people with nonadherence had a significantly lower mean antibiotics knowledge score (1.3 \u00B1 1.0 versus 2.0 \u00B1 0.9, P \u003C .001), with no interaction with education (P \u003C .05). Adjusted for potential confounders, antibiotics knowledge scores of 2, 1, and 0 independently predicted increased risk of nonadherence by 1-fold (odds ratio [OR], 2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.94; P = .047), 4-fold (OR, 4.77; 95% CI: 2.30-9.92; P \u003C .001), and 17-fold (OR, 18.41; 95% CI: 6.92-48.97; P \u003C .001) respectively, compared with the maximum score of 3.

Here, we describe improved biosynthetic peptide (BSP) method using a newly developed plasmid pXXGST-3 as vector, which has a viral E7 gene in the cloning sites of pXXGST-1. It is crucial to employ pXXGST-3 instead of pXXGST-1, since it makes use of the BSP method simpler and easier to perform, and more cost-effective for epitope mapping. These merits are embodied in two aspects: i) convenient recovery of double enzyme-digested product due to the existence of 315 bp inserted between BamH I and Sal I sites, and thus greatly reducing the production of self-ligation clones, and ii) no longer requiring control protein when screening recombinant (r-) clones expressing 8/18mer peptides by running polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protocol involves the following core steps: (i) design of plus and minus strands of DNA fragments encoding overlapping 8/18mer peptides; (ii) chemical synthesis of the designed DNA fragments; (iii) development of r-clones using pXXGST-3 vector expressing each 8/18mer peptide fused with truncated GST188 protein; (iv) screening r-clones by running the cell pellets from each induced clone on SDS-PAGE gel followed by sequencing of inserted DNA fragments for each verified r-clone; and (v) Western blotting with either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies.

Understanding the demographic and clinical features of influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) presenting to primary care in urban Vietnam is vital to understand these transmission dynamics. METHODS: An observational study of patients with ILI in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, was conducted between August 2013 and November 2015 in a mix of public and private primary care settings. Molecular testing for influenza A and influenza B and 12 other respiratory viruses was performed. RESULTS: A total of 1152 ILI patients were recruited. 322 and 136 subjects tested positive for influenza A and influenza B, respectively. 193 subjects tested positive for another respiratory virus; most commonly rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus 3. Influenza was detected in 81% of the 116 study weeks. Three peaks of influenza activity were detected; an H3N2 peak April\u2010June 2014, an influenza B peak July\u2010December 2014, and a mixed H3N2 and H1N1 peak March\u2010September 2015. Subjects recruited from private clinics were more likely to have higher income and to have reported previous influenza vaccination. Antibiotic use was common (50.3%) despite limited evidence of bacterial infection. CONCLUSION: Influenza in southern Vietnam has complex transmission dynamics including periods of intense influenza activity of alternating types and subtypes.

This study shows that a microarray using PCR probes is a potentially useful method to monitor the populations of bacteria in respiratory specimens and can be tailored to specific clinical needs such as respiratory infections of particular patient populations, including patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Curran, Tanya; Coulter, Wilson A.; Fairley, Derek J.; McManus, Terence; Kidney, Joe; Larkin, Mike; Moore, John E.; Coyle, Peter V.","journal":"Journal of Microbiological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0dfe43246f99164a436ae3b7cb334e645a0532ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132519.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2010.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20074591/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701210000059; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167701210000059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","Coxiella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR probes","real-time PCR","developed microarray","novel microarray","Streptococcus pneumoniae","respiratory specimens","bacterial species","DNA PCR product probes","Chlamydia pneumoniae","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","species specific functional genes","significant respiratory pathogens","respiratory infections of particular patient populations","Gram-positive organisms","Gram-negative organisms","Streptococcus pyogenes","populations of bacteria","sputum specimens","samples positive","COPD patients","specific clinical needs","Coxiella burnetii Haemophilus","Legionella pneumophila","Moraxella catarrhalis","cystic fibrosis","useful method","concept","evaluation","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","bronchiectasis","atypical bacterium","proof","study"],"language":"en"},

By using tools from control and bifurcation theory, it is proved that there exists a critical value of time-delay for the stability of the model. When the time-delay passes through the critical value, the model loses its stability and a Hopf bifurcation occurs. To enhance the stability of the model, we propose an improved hybrid control strategy in which state feedback and parameter perturbation are used. Through linear stability analysis, we show that by adjusting the control parameter properly, the onset of Hopf bifurcation of the controlled model can be delayed or eliminated without changing the equilibrium point of the model. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the theoretical analysis.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Dawei; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Wang, Nian; Liang, Dong","journal":"J Shanghai Jiaotong Univ Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe9abc924f82073e0146b474e283fe3c4e72049d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12204-017-1823-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288413/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["time-delay","Hopf bifurcation control","bifurcation parameter","onset of Hopf bifurcation","control parameter","controlled model","bifurcation theory","critical value of time","effect of time","small-world network model","linear stability analysis","parameter perturbation","improved hybrid control strategy","theoretical analysis","state feedback","tools","relationship","emphasis","equilibrium point","numerical simulations","paper"],"language":"en"},

Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Xiaolong; Li, Cheng; Huang, Ailing; Xia, Shuai; Lu, Sicong; Shi, Zhengli; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Shibo; Yang, Zhenlin; Wu, Yanling; Ying, Tianlei","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV RBD","nCoV infections","RBD of SARS","anti-SARS-CoV antibodies","nCoV spike protein","potent SARS-CoV","specific neutralizing antibodies","therapeutic antibodies","novel monoclonal antibodies","ACE2 binding site of SARS","human infections","specific human monoclonal antibody","cross-reactivity","specific antiviral treatment","human health","epitope of CR3022","novel coronavirus","high identity of receptor binding domain","rapid development of vaccines","important implications","serious threat","deaths","combination","critical impact","CR3014","m396","difference","prevention","candidate therapeutics","potential","KD","nM","laboratory","time"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this minireview is to present epidemiological data related to metabolic comorbidities in association with the SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until April 23, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D. RESULTS: Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir. In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors. Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human\u0027s cell entry. Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon. Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases. CONCLUSION: Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Lucena, Thays Maria Costa; da Silva Santos, Ariane Fernandes; de Lima Fabr\u00EDcio, Brenda Regina; de Albuquerque Borborema, Maria Eduarda; de Azev\u00EAdo Silva, Jaqueline","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/375621ffe0704dfaea756d6a444d57819e3e82eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215143.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120301430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417709/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301430?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","inflammatory response","obese individuals","Hypertensive individuals","unbalanced immune response","diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes","immune system","Studies","conditions","cytokine storm phenomenon","new coronavirus","treatment of coronavirus","Vitamin D","keywords COVID","uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines","pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders","control of cardiometabolic diseases","constant glucose recognition","arterial hypertension","worse prognosis","ACE-inhibitors","obesity","diabetes mellitus","C type lectin receptors","RESULTS","ARB","terms","addition","important role","metabolic comorbidities","outbreak","association","effective antiviral therapy","respiratory disease","narrative mini-review","Pubmed search","epidemiological data","adipose tissue","blood pressure","potential therapeutic target","infections","increased ACE2 expression","infection course","human\u0027s cell entry","minireview","pathogen reservoir","ACEi","AIMS","drugs","risks of associated complications","efforts","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The breakthrough of the subject is that we can construct the moment vectors from DNA sequences using this new graphical method and prove that the correspondence between moment vectors and DNA sequences is one-to-one. Using these moment vectors, we have constructed a novel genome space as a subspace in R(N). It allows us to show that the SARS-CoV is most closely related to a coronavirus from the palm civet not from a bird as initially suspected, and the newly discovered human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1 is more closely related to SARS than to any other known member of group 2 coronavirus. Furthermore, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree for 34 lentiviruses (including human immunodeficiency virus) based on their whole genome sequences.

Member States\u2019 divergent responses to this crisis reveal a lack of unity in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe. At best, this undermines the effectiveness of health protection within the European Union (EU). At worst, it risks breaking up the Union altogether. Divergent national responses to COVID-19 reflect different national preferences and political legitimacy, and thus cannot be completely avoided. In this article, we argue that these responses should be better coordinated. Without coordination, the price for diversity is high. Firstly, there are damaging spill-overs between Member States, which undermine key pillars of European integration such as the free movement of persons and of goods. Secondly, national policy-making is easily captured by local interest groups. Our proposal is that the EU indicates \u2013 not mandates \u2013 a European exit strategy from asymmetric containment policies of COVID-19. In particular, the EU should help Member States procure and validate tests for infection and immunity.

The tail mediates attachment of the virus to the host surface receptor, as well-as ejection of the viral genome into the host. The distal tip of the tail binds the extracellular ectodomain of the Bacillus subtilis receptor YueB, while the tail tube provides a conduit to funnel the viral genome into the host. This process, which culminates with the ejection of the ~44 kb of viral DNA across the thick, cell envelope of the Gram-positive bacterial cell, takes place in a time scale of seconds to minutes and represents a remarkable example of biotransformation. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Auzat et al. provide compelling evidence that the two major structural proteins of the SPP1 tail, gp17.1 (~19.1 kDa) and gp17.1* (~28 kDa), share a common N-terminal sequence, and that gp17.1* is generated by a translational frameshift in the gene 17.1. The extra domain fused to gp17.1* is synthesized by a \u002B1 programmed translational frame-shift at the end of gene 17.1, which leads to the synthesis of approximately one gp17.1* for every three equivalents of gp17.1. This finding extends our current knowledge of translational frameshifts and provides a framework to understand how Siphoviridae phages like SPP1 have developed long-tail machines using only two major structural proteins.","publish_time":"2008-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olia, Adam S.; Cingolani, Gino","journal":"Molecular Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0896ceda205c251524a97c8687cc7a517a2aa68d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2779026.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18826406/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06434.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SPP1 tail","tail machines","tail tube","tail apparatus","equivalents of gp17","viral genome","major structural proteins","host surface receptor","bacteriophage SPP1","viral DNA","ejection","kDa","cell envelope","programmed translational frame-shift","current knowledge of translational frameshifts","molecular machine","end of gene","Gram-positive bacterial cell","issue of Molecular Microbiology","Bacillus subtilis receptor YueB","place","compelling evidence","extracellular ectodomain","minutes","Auzat","virus","time scale of seconds","framework","common N-terminal sequence","conduit","remarkable example of biotransformation","Siphoviridae phages","attachment","distal tip","extra domain","process","synthesis"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that immunostimulation by unmodified siRNA could mediate both RNAi as well as innate immune stimulation depending on the mode of drug delivery. We investigated the potential of immunostimulatory RNAs (isRNAs) to suppress influenza A virus in vivo in the mouse lung. Lipidoid 98N12-5(1) formulated with unmodified siRNA targeting the influenza nucleoprotein gene exhibited antiviral activity. Formulations were optimized to increase antiviral activity, but the antiviral activity of lipidoid-delivered siRNA did not depend on sequence homology to the influenza genome as siRNA directed against unrelated targets also suppressed influenza replication in vivo. This activity was primarily attributed to enhancement of innate immune stimulation by lipidoid-mediated delivery, which indicates increased toll-like receptor (TLR) activation by siRNA. Certain chemical modifications to the siRNA backbone, which block TLR7/8 activation but retain in vitro RNAi activity, prevented siRNA-mediated antiviral activity despite enhanced lipidoid-mediated delivery.

NIRVs are thought to sometimes confer virus resistance, meaning that they could impact spread of the virus in the host population. However, a NIRV that is expressed may also impact the evolution of virus populations within host organisms. Here, we experimentally addressed the evolution of a virus in a host expressing a NIRV using Tobacco etch virus (TEV), a plant RNA virus, and transgenic tobacco plants expressing its replicase, NIb. We found that a virus missing the NIb gene, TEV-\u0394NIb, which is incapable of autonomous replication in wild-type plants, had a higher fitness than the full-length TEV in the transgenic plants. Moreover, when the full-length TEV was evolved by serial passages in transgenic plants, we observed genomic deletions within NIb\u2014and in some cases the adjacent cistrons\u2014starting from the first passage. When we passaged TEV and TEV-\u0394NIb in transgenic plants, we found mutations in proteolytic sites, but these only occurred in TEV-\u0394NIb lineages, suggesting the adaptation of polyprotein processing to altered NIb expression. These results raise the possibility that NIRV expression can indeed induce the deletion of the corresponding genes in the viral genome, resulting in the formation of viruses that are replication defective in hosts that do not express the same NIRV. Moreover, virus genome evolution was contingent upon the deletion of the viral replicase, suggesting NIRV expression could also alter patterns of virus evolution.","publish_time":"2014-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tromas, Nicolas; Zwart, Mark P.; Forment, Javier; Elena, Santiago F.","journal":"Genome Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfffc49744be05481a8a3d0266b38c8c2a816f14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3971587.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558257/; https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evu036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIRV","TEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus genome evolution","virus resistance","evolution of virus populations","patterns of virus evolution","transgenic plants","full-length TEV","plant RNA virus","NIRV expression","transgenic tobacco plants","TEV-\u0394NIb lineages","altered NIb expression","genes of nonretroviral RNA viruses","NIb gene","host organisms","wild-type plants","Nonretroviral integrated RNA viruses","formation of viruses","viral genome","viral replicase","NIRVs","host population","corresponding genes","replication defective","eukaryotic organisms","incapable of autonomous replication","adaptation of polyprotein processing","genomes","higher fitness","serial passages","mutations","genomic deletions","cases","hosts","results","possibility","adjacent cistrons","proteolytic sites","spread"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/- mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4\u2019s impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis. Given the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection. With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes.

Health organization involves a vast complex of stakeholders and participants, suppliers and purchasers, regulators and direct providers, and individual patients, and their decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome is a new viral respiratory illness. Nursing students who engage in clinical practice at hospitals may have been exposed to Middle East respiratory syndrome infection during the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. DESIGN: This study was a descriptive cross\u2010sectional survey. METHODS: Participants (n = 249) were nursing students in their third or fourth year of the programme who were engaged in clinical practice for eight hours per day at the tertiary hospitals with Middle East respiratory syndrome patients. Knowledge, preventive behaviours and risk perception related to Middle East respiratory syndrome were measured using scales developed through a preliminary survey and validity testing. RESULTS: The subjects\u2019 knowledge level of Middle East respiratory syndrome was 84\u00B74%; their practice of preventive behaviours was rated at 44\u00B75%; and their risk perception rating was 2\u00B74 out of 5. Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2013related risk perception was significantly different according to gender and Middle East respiratory syndrome education. Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2013related knowledge was significantly correlated with preventive behaviours and risk perception. CONCLUSION: Considering the low scores for items regarding knowledge and preventive behaviours, it is necessary to develop effective and systematic publicity and education programmes for nursing students. Enhancing Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2013related knowledge by considering cooperation between hospitals and universities will sharpen nursing students\u2019 risk perception of the disease and effectively increase their preventive behaviours. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Similar to other emerging infectious diseases, Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks may occur in other countries. The results of this study can be used to develop and apply efficient and feasible Middle East respiratory syndrome education programmes for nursing students during Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks.","publish_time":"2016-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ji Soo; Choi, Jeong Sil","journal":"J Clin Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16f2c91d2b64684369c25f8858b7246c4e1a4929.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166634.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.13295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27273475/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks","Middle East respiratory syndrome infection","Middle East respiratory syndrome patients","nursing students\u2019 Middle East respiratory syndrome","subjects\u2019 knowledge level of Middle East respiratory syndrome","feasible Middle East respiratory syndrome education programmes","related risk perception","related knowledge","practice of preventive behaviours","nursing students\u2019 risk perception","new viral respiratory illness","risk perception rating","clinical practice","study","tertiary hospitals","preliminary survey","RESULTS","descriptive cross\u2010sectional survey","emerging infectious diseases","gender","systematic publicity","day","universities","hours","items","cooperation","scales","variables","low scores","correlations","BACKGROUND","validity testing","RELEVANCE","METHODS","Participants","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVES","aim","DESIGN","year","countries"],"language":"en"},

But the current in-hospital thromboprophylaxis remains suboptimal and there exists a large gap between clinical practice and guideline-recommended care in China. Methods To facilitate implementation of guideline recommendations, we conduct a multicenter, adjudicator-blinded, cluster-randomized clinical trial, aiming to assess the effectiveness of a system-wide multifaceted quality improvement (QI) strategy on VTE prophylaxis improvement and thromboembolism reduction in clinical setting. Hospitals are randomized into intervention or control group. In intervention group, hospitals receive the concept of appropriate in-hospital thromboprophylaxis plus a multifaceted QI which encompasses four components: (1) an electronic alert combining computer-based clinical decision support system and electronic reminders, (2) appropriate prophylaxis based on dynamic VTE and bleeding risk assessments, (3) periodical audit and interactive feedback on performance, (4) strengthened training and patient education. In control, hospitals receive the concept of recommended prophylaxis alone without QI. Thromboprophylaxis will be at the discretion of hospitals and conducted as usual. With a final sample size of 5760 hospitalized patients in 32 hospitals on mainland China, this trial will examine the effect of QI on improvement in thromboprophylaxis and patient-centered outcomes. This is an open-label trial that patients and healthcare professionals will know group allocation after enrollment, but endpoint adjudicators and statisticians will be blinded.

In particular, intertypic recombination is implicated in the emergence of most pathogenic circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses, which have caused numerous outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis worldwide. Recent experimental studies that relied on recombination cellular systems mimicking natural genetic exchanges between enteroviruses provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms of enterovirus recombination and enabled to define a new model of genetic plasticity for enteroviruses. Homologous intertypic recombinant enteroviruses that were observed in nature would be the final products of a multi-step process, during which precursor nonhomologous recombinant genomes are generated through an initial inter-genomic RNA recombination event and can then evolve into a diversity of fitter homologous recombinant genomes over subsequent intra-genomic rearrangements. Moreover, these experimental studies demonstrated that the enterovirus genome could be defined as a combination of genomic modules that can be preferentially exchanged through recombination, and enabled defining the boundaries of these recombination modules. These results provided the first experimental evidence supporting the theoretical model of enterovirus modular evolution previously elaborated from phylogenetic studies of circulating enterovirus strains. This review summarizes our current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of recombination in enteroviruses and presents a new evolutionary process that may apply to other RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2019-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muslin, Claire; Mac Kain, Alice; Bessaud, Ma\u00EBl; Blondel, Bruno; Delpeyroux, Francis","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22a7db49b1d6a2856d8737d3739af18b715cd399.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6784155.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11090859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanisms of recombination","intertypic recombination","recombination modules","molecular mechanisms of enterovirus recombination","recombination cellular systems","Homologous intertypic recombinant enteroviruses","initial inter-genomic RNA recombination event","enterovirus genome","Recent experimental studies","new model of genetic plasticity","phylogenetic studies of circulating enterovirus strains","new insights","genetic architecture","theoretical model of enterovirus modular evolution","new evolutionary process","experimental evidence","combination of genomic modules","RNA viruses","diversity of fitter homologous recombinant genomes","precursor nonhomologous recombinant genomes","natural genetic exchanges","subsequent intra-genomic rearrangements","multi-step process","pathogenic circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses","major driving force","final products","emergence","current knowledge","nature","numerous outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis","boundaries","review","results"],"language":"en"},

The cat died 10 days after the initial presentation and a necropsy examination was performed. Grossly, extensive pale lesions were seen in the wall of the left ventricle and the septum of the heart. There were no detectable masses in the heart, skeletal muscles or peripheral nerves. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse, extensive infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells in the heart; the cardiac muscles were markedly degenerate and atrophic and were replaced by the neoplastic cells. Neoplastic cells with similar morphology were seen in all specimens of the skeletal muscles and peripheral nerves. Clonality analysis of the paraffin wax-embedded heart tissue revealed a monoclonal rearrangement of the gene encoding the T-cell receptor \u03B3 chain.

Based on the observation that SARSCoV infection is efficiently controlled upon passive transfer of antibodies directed against the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV, vaccines containing the S protein have been formulated. Animals immunized with inactivated whole virus vaccines or live-recombinant vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV S protein (e.g., using rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, adenovirus, or attenuated vaccinia virus MVA as a vector), as well as mice immunized with DNA vaccines expressing the S protein gene all developed neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV and were protected against SARS-CoV challenge. Although much effort has been focused on developing a SARS vaccine, the commercial viability of such a vaccine for SARS-CoV will ultimately depend on whether the virus re-emerges in the near future. This vaccine should induce highly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to protect against newly emerging viruses related to SARS-CoV and protect both the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract in the absence of significant side effects. Given the fact that in the previous outbreak mainly the elderly succumbed to the infection, special attention should be given to vaccines that are able to efficiently protect aged individuals.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haagmans, Bart L.; Osterhaus, Albert D.M.E.","journal":"Vaccines for Biodefense and Emerging and Neglected Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d94ef771dd5097cb7e2c3563f73644fd8a83bbcf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149452.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123694089000366; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123694089000366","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein of SARS","virus vaccines","SARS-CoV S protein","SARS vaccine","SARS-CoV challenge","candidate SARS-coronavirus","rabies virus","DNA vaccines","S protein gene","vesicular stomatitis virus","live-recombinant vaccines","bovine parainfluenza virus type","attenuated vaccinia virus MVA","cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies","passive transfer of antibodies","respiratory tract","previous outbreak","SARSCoV infection","severe acute respiratory syndrome","adenovirus","various stages of preclinical","vector","spike","absence of significant","commercial viability","emerging viruses","clinical development","years","elderly","special attention","mice","Animals","aged individuals","effects","observation","fact","near future","effort"],"language":"en"},

The patients were divided into four groups according to the presence of drug withdrawal as well as seizure attack. In each group, seizures occurring during three different periods were compared. Risk factors for seizure recurrence were also examined. Results Of 227 cases, 49 stopped taking medication during the outbreak. Among them, 28 suffered seizure attacks during AED withdrawal. Four cases developed cluster attacks and two cases had status epilepticus after AED withdrawal. AED withdrawal produced a significant increase in seizure frequency. The major risk factors for withdrawal seizures were symptomatic etiologies, polytherapy and non-seizure free before AED withdrawal. Conclusions The SARS outbreak adversely affected seizure control because of AED withdrawal. Patients with polytherapy, non-seizure free and symptomatic etiologies were more susceptible to recurrence of seizures after AED withdrawal.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Shung-Lon; Hsu, Min-Tao; Chen, Shun-Sheng","journal":"Seizure","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33e819b7997f4b0e3570a918a76b141d7c7f6ffe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111166.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1059131105001548; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059131105001548","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AED withdrawal","withdrawal seizures","seizure recurrence","seizure control","seizure attacks","seizure frequency","non-seizure free","impact of drug withdrawal","presence of drug withdrawal","patient\u0027s seizure diary","SARS outbreak periods","recurrence of seizures","cases","patients","symptomatic etiologies","polytherapy","major risk factors","Antiepileptic drug","cluster attacks","different periods","severe acute respiratory syndrome","status epilepticus","significant increase","good model","hospital","Summary Background","groups","Conclusions","fear of infection","Methods","medication","Results"],"language":"en"},

The S protein fragment was purified from the culture supernatant of stably transformed HEK293T cells secreting a tagged version of the protein. The vaccine was given subcutaneously to 129S6/SvEv mice in saline, with alum adjuvant or with alum plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Mice immunized with the adjuvanted antigen elicited strong antibody and cellular immune responses; furthermore, adding the CpG ODN to the alum resulted in increased IgG2a antibody titers and a higher number of INF-\u03B3-secreting murine splenocytes. Mice vaccinated with S318\u2013510 deglycosylated by PNGase F (dgS318\u2013510) showed a lower neutralizing antibody response but had similar numbers of INF-\u03B3-producing cells in the spleen.

METHODS: One hundred and forty-six patients who underwent esophagectomy between 1995 and 2011 for stage II and III cancer were selected and separated into open esophagectomy (Open) and MIE groups. Risk adjustment was performed using the CCI-G. The outcomes of interest were operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), lymph node harvest, length of hospital stay (LOS), major complications, 30-day mortality, and overall survival. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (44 %) underwent Open while 71 (49 %) had MIE. An additional (7 %) were converted and classified with MIE. There was no significant difference between MIE and Open in terms of operative time. MIE had less EBL (mean difference = 234 mL, p \u003C 0.001), higher lymph node harvest (mean = 7.4 nodes, p \u003C 0.001), and shorter LOS (median = 1.5 days, p = 0.02). Atrial arrhythmias were the most frequent complication, occurring in 33 % of patients in both the MIE and the Open group (p = 0.988). Thirty-day mortality was 2 % for MIE and 5 % for Open (p = 0.459). Five-year survival was 41 % for MIE and 33 % for Open (p = 0.513). Operative approach, age, gender, BMI, clinical stage, and neoadjuvant therapy did not have any significant effect on the outcomes or overall survival. CCI-G influenced outcomes with operative time, LOS, cardiovascular complication, and anastomotic leak rate, favoring CCI-G 0 compared to CCI-G 3. Overall survival was worse for CCI-G 1 in comparison with CCI-G 0 [hazard ratio (HR) 1.99, p = 0.027]. CONCLUSIONS: MIE is a safe alternative to open esophagectomy for the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. The presence of comorbidities increased operative time, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications while worsening overall survival.","publish_time":"2013-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dolan, James P.; Kaur, Taranjeet; Diggs, Brian S.; Luna, Renato A.; Schipper, Paul H.; Tieu, Brandon H.; Sheppard, Brett C.; Hunter, John G.","journal":"Surg Endosc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02feca921c32b8f0598dc9b8ae6cfff6b36410a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102391.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102391/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["MIE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["open esophagectomy","overall survival","MIE groups","Open group","CCI-G influenced outcomes","Five-year survival","terms of operative time","Operative approach","patients","predicting outcomes","invasive esophagectomy","length of hospital","EBL","shorter LOS","mean difference","significant difference","day mortality","higher lymph node harvest","cardiovascular complication","clinical stage","frequent complication","major complications","postoperative complications","significant effect","advanced esophageal cancer","BMI","gender","treatment","anastomotic leak rate","estimated blood loss","safe alternative","Charlson Comorbidity Index-Grade","neoadjuvant therapy","hazard ratio","impact","median","days","HR","nodes","comparison","presence of comorbidities","study","Atrial arrhythmias","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","aim","Risk adjustment","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Protein cages are studied extensively for applications in nanotechnology, nanomedicine and materials science. Their inner and outer surfaces can be modified chemically or genetically, and the internal cavity can be used to template, store and/or arrange molecular cargos. Virus capsids and virus-like particles (VLP, noninfectious particles) provide versatile platforms for nanoscale bioengineering. Study of capsid protein self-assembly into monodispersed particles, and of VLP structure and biophysics is necessary not only to understand natural processes, but also to infer how these platforms can be redesigned to furnish novel functional VLP. Here we address the assembly dynamics of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a complex icosahedral virus. IBDV has a ~70 nm-diameter T = 13 capsid with VP2 trimers as the only structural subunits. During capsid assembly, VP2 is synthesized as a precursor (pVP2) whose C terminus is cleaved. The pVP2 C terminus has an amphipathic helix that controls VP2 polymorphism. In the absence of the VP3 scaffolding protein, necessary for control of assembly, 466/456-residue pVP2 intermediates bearing this helix assemble into VLP only when expressed with an N-terminal His(6) tag (the HT-VP2-466 protein). HT-VP2-466 capsids are optimal for genetic insertion of proteins (cargo space ~78 000 nm(3)). We established an in vitro assembly/disassembly system of HT-VP2-466-based VLP for heterologous nucleic acid packaging and/or encapsulation of drugs and other molecules. HT-VP2-466 (empty) capsids were disassembled and reassembled by dialysis against low-salt/basic pH and high-salt/acid pH buffers, respectively, thus illustrating the reversibility in vitro of IBDV capsid assembly. HT-VP2-466 VLP also packed heterologous DNA by non-specific confinement during assembly. These and previous results establish the bases for biotechnological applications based on the IBDV capsid and its ability to incorporate exogenous proteins and nucleic acids.","publish_time":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pascual, Elena; Mata, Carlos P; Carrascosa, Jos\u00E9 L; Cast\u00F3n, Jos\u00E9 R","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/deb16146b53f1a1ef2755f819c1aec785f98649b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103166.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQ4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VLP","IBDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HT-VP2","IBDV capsid assembly","virus capsids","VP2 trimers","VP2 polymorphism","based VLP","VLP structure","control of assembly","Study of capsid protein self-assembly","Protein cages","novel functional VLP","assembly dynamics of infectious bursal disease virus","VP3 scaffolding protein","complex icosahedral virus","Hollow protein containers","pVP2 C terminus","disassembly system of HT","monodispersed particles","noninfectious particles","heterologous nucleic acid packaging","acid pH buffers","residue pVP2 intermediates","high-salt","basic pH","biotechnological applications","amphipathic helix","heterologous DNA","low-salt","exogenous proteins","nucleic acids","versatile platforms","genetic insertion of proteins","nm-diameter T","nature","cargo space","ability","non-specific confinement","nanotechnology","nanomedicine","bases","encapsulation of drugs","dialysis","precursor","materials science","previous results","nanoscale bioengineering","absence","structural subunits","biophysics","tag","reversibility","bacterial complexes","outer surfaces","store","molecular cargos","molecules","natural processes","N-terminal","internal cavity"],"language":"en"},

We found an inhomogeneous stress distribution in various portions of the CCMV structure and stress transfer from one portion of the virus structure to another, which also points to the importance of entropic effects, often ignored in finite element analysis and elastic network modeling. We formulate a criterion for elastic deformation using the first principal stress components.

There is increasing evidence that mannose-binding lectin (MBL) has a complex role in many diseases, particularly in infectious diseases. However, the relationship between MBL deficiency and cryptococcal meningitis has not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between MBL polymorphism and non-HIV cryptococcal meningitis. Methods. A case-controlled genetic association study was conducted. Patients with cryptococcal meningitis and control subjects were genotyped for 6 alleles of MBL2 gene (H/L, Y/X, P/Q, A/D, A/B, and A/C). The distributions in allele frequency, genotypes, haplotypes, and genotype groups were compared between patients and control subjects. Results. Study participants included 103 HIV-uninfected patients with cryptococcal meningitis and 208 healthy control subjects, all of Chinese Han ethnicity. The homozygous mutative genotypes (O/O) of the coding region were associated with cryptococcal meningitis (P = .023; odds ratio [OR], 4.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11\u201319.88), the correlation more overt in immunocompetent patients (P = .005; OR, 6.65; 95% CI, 1.49\u201333.05).

To clarify the effects of FAdV-4 on immune organs in birds, we conducted a detailed examination of dynamic morphology and damage mechanisms in chickens randomly divided into 4 groups (FAdV-4, vaccination, FAdV-4 plus vaccination, and control). FAdV-4 caused the depletion of lymphocytes and subsequent growth impairment in the thymus and bursa. Chickens infected with FAdV-4 and subjected to vaccination experienced greater inhibition of antibody responses to inactivated vaccines against Newcastle disease and avian influenza virus subtype H9 than uninfected and vaccinated chickens.

Lewis rats were fed diets containing 80 g of SDAP/kg diet, 22.7 g of IC/kg diet, or milk proteins (Control diet) from postnatal d 21 (weaning) for 14 d. On d 30 and 33, rats were given SEB (0.5 mg/kg body weight; i.p.). Organized gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) populations, intestinal secretion, mucosal and serum immunoglobulin concentrations, and neutrophil infiltration were studied. On d 35, blood was collected under anesthesia and samples of intestinal mucosa, Peyer\u0027s patches, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and spleen were taken. SEB increased the water content of feces, which was prevented by diets containing either SDAP (P \u003C 0.002) or IC (P \u003C 0.001), indicating that plasma protein\u2013supplemented diets can reverse the SEB-induced secretory response. In Peyer\u0027s patches, the diet containing SDAP partially prevented the SEB-induced increase in T lymphocytes (P \u003C 0.1) and reduced the percentage of activated T helper cells (P \u003C 0.05). In MLN, activated T lymphocytes were increased by SEB but they were not affected by diet. No effects of SEB or dietary supplementation on mucosal IgA and serum IgA and IgG were observed. The effects of SDAP supplementation on the lymphocyte populations of GALT in rats challenged with SEB support the view that SDAP can modulate the immune response and suggest that plasma protein supplementation can prevent GALT from possible activation by luminal bacterial superantigens.","publish_time":"2004-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rez-Bosque, Anna; Pelegr\u00ED, Carme; Vicario, Mar\u00EDa; Castell, Margarida; Russell, Louis; Campbell, Joy M.; Quigley, James D.; Polo, Javier; Amat, Concepci\u00F3; Moret\u00F3, Miquel","journal":"J Nutr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107471.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107471/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["SDAP","SEB","IC","GALT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of SEB","effects of SDAP supplementation","g of SDAP","SEB-induced increase","immune response of rats","Control diet","supplemented diets","plasma protein supplementation","T lymphocytes","g of IC","Lewis rats","potential modulatory effects of diets","serum IgA","mucosal IgA","dietary supplementation","lymphocyte populations of GALT","Peyer\u0027s patches","MLN","secretory response","postnatal d","serum immunoglobulin concentrations","percentage of activated T helper cells","intestinal secretion","immunoglobulin concentrates","spray-dried animal plasma","samples of intestinal mucosa","possible activation","mesenteric lymph nodes","Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B","lymphoid tissue","milk proteins","luminal bacterial superantigens","anesthesia","neutrophil infiltration","IgG","view","Organized gut","water content of feces","study","blood","weaning","spleen","body weight","aim"],"language":"en"},

Many different types of animal models of fungal infection have been developed, with murine models the most frequently used, for studies of pathogenesis, virulence, immunology, diagnosis, and therapy. The ability to control numerous variables in performing the model allows us to mimic human disease states and quantitatively monitor the course of the disease. However, no single model can answer all questions and different animal species or different routes of infection can show somewhat different results. Thus, the choice of which animal model to use must be made carefully, addressing issues of the type of human disease to mimic, the parameters to follow and collection of the appropriate data to answer those questions being asked. This review addresses a variety of uses for animal models in medical mycology. It focuses on the most clinically important diseases affecting humans and cites various examples of the different types of studies that have been performed. Overall, animal models of fungal infection will continue to be valuable tools in addressing questions concerning fungal infections and contribute to our deeper understanding of how these infections occur, progress and can be controlled and eliminated.","publish_time":"2007-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Capilla, Javier; Clemons, Karl V.; Stevens, David A.","journal":"Med Mycol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d944e3bbcea6bd4775fabf48983711da5c3bcdc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107685.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzcwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Animal models of fungal infections","different types of animal models of fungal infection","different animal species","different routes of infection","different types of studies","different results","questions","murine models","type of human disease","human disease states","single model","medical mycology","studies of pathogenesis","various examples","immunology","valuable tools","diagnosis","humans","virulence","advancement","important diseases","deeper understanding","collection","numerous variables","appropriate data","parameters","issues","course","variety","key tool","ability","therapy","choice","review","progress"],"language":"en"},

With use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a centrifugation-enhanced viral culture method, we characterized the viruses causing acute respiratory infection in adults during an influenza season. Methods. During January-March 2002, nasopharyngeal wash specimens from previously healthy adults presenting with respiratory symptoms were evaluated for viral pathogens with centrifugation-enhanced viral culture and PCR. Results The diagnoses in 266 cases included unspecified upper respiratory infection (in 142 [54%] of the cases), acute bronchitis (42 [16%]), sinusitis (23 [9%]), pharyngitis (22 [8%]), and pneumonia (17 [6%]). The use of a shell vial assay and PCR identified a pathogen in 103 (39%) of the patients, including influenza A or B in 54, picornavirus in 28 (including rhinovirus in 24), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 12, human metapneumovirus in 4, human coronavirus OC43 in 2, adenovirus in 2, parainfluenza virus type 1 in 1, and coinfection with influenza and parainfluenza virus type 1 in 2. Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that, even during the influenza season, rhinovirus and RSV are prevalent and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of adult acute respiratory infection before prescribing antiviral medication. Human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus did not play a substantial role. PCR was an especially useful tool in the identification of influenza and other viral pathogens not easily detected by traditional testing methods.","publish_time":"2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Louie, Janice K.; Hacker, Jill K.; Gonzales, Ralph; Mark, Jennifer; Maselli, Judy H.; Yagi, Shigeo; Drew, W.

Induction of heat shock proteins (HSP), i.e. of the major family member HSP70, is an important cytoprotective-resistance mechanism for monocytes/ macrophages (Mphi). Patients on haemodialysis present with a high infectious morbidity and enhanced carcinoma incidence. Renal insufficiency-related alteration of microbicidal and tumoricidal functions of Mphi, major effectors of the immune system, might promote these diseases. Methods. Freshly isolated Mphi from Sprague\u2013Dawley rats 2 weeks after 5/6-nephrectomy and from patients on intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) were stimulated by heat shock (HS) and compared to stimulated Mphi of control rats or healthy volunteers (CTR). Expression of HSP72 (inducible HSP70) was assessed by RT-PCR, and/or flow cytometry. Apoptosis of Mphi was detected by flow cytometry (CD14/annexin V-labelling). Results. In rat Mphi, baseline HSP72 expression was similar in both groups, but its induction was significantly impaired in renal insufficiency (214 \u00B1 68% less HSP70-mRNA versus CTR, n = 6). In patients, HSF-1-mRNA and HSP72-mRNA/protein response to HS was significantly lower, but not affected by dialysis session itself. In parallel, apoptosis of Mphi of patients was enhanced (\u002B83 \u00B1 29% constitutive apoptotic Mphi versus CTR, n = 8), and HS-dependent protection from apoptosis with and without serum depletion (48 h depletion: HS, \u002B275 \u00B1 37% apoptotic Mphi versus CTR, n = 6; full medium: \u002B166 \u00B1 62% versus CTR, n = 8, P \u003C 0.05) was inferior. Conclusions. Impaired HSP72 stress response of Mphi in patients on haemodialysis might contribute to the observed immune dysfunction and, therefore, to the increased susceptibility to infection and malignancy. Stress impairment is not restricted to uraemia but is already present in a rat model of chronic kidney disease.","publish_time":"2009-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reuter, Stefan; Bangen, Philip; Edemir, Bayram; Hillebrand, Uta; Pavenst\u00E4dt, Hermann; Heidenreich, Stefan; Lang, Detlef","journal":"Nephrol Dial Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33f925c0d9eb1e4697a12d38f8892c06186b868b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107957.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107957/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozc3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Apoptosis of Mphi","rat Mphi","isolated Mphi","Patients","CTR","constitutive apoptotic Mphi","tumoricidal functions of Mphi","Impaired HSP72 stress response of Mphi","stimulated Mphi of control rats","HSP72-mRNA","Expression of HSP72","HSP70-mRNA","haemodialysis present","baseline HSP72 expression","intermittent haemodialysis","inducible HSP70","flow cytometry","HS-dependent protection","major family member HSP70","Induction of heat shock proteins","Dawley rats","protein response","major effectors","serum depletion","h depletion","immune system","Stress impairment","Renal insufficiency-related alteration of microbicidal","enhanced carcinoma incidence","observed immune dysfunction","rat model of chronic kidney disease","high infectious morbidity","important cytoprotective-resistance mechanism","monocytes","healthy volunteers","CD14","Sprague","nephrectomy","IHD","annexin V-labelling","weeks","macrophages","groups","increased susceptibility","infection","malignancy","RT-PCR","uraemia","HSF","diseases","dialysis session","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

We examined RSV and influenza (flu) surveillance data from the US National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and used this information to define RSV and flu outbreak periods in the Maryland area. Outbreak periods consisted of consecutive individual weeks during which at least 10% of RSV and/or flu diagnostic tests were positive. We examined relationships of RSV and flu outbreaks to occurrence of 4 advanced medical outcomes (hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, intubated mechanical ventilation, and death) due to medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI). RESULTS: Occurrences of all 4 MAARI-related hospital advanced medical outcomes were consistently greater for all adult ages during RSV, flu, and combined RSV\u2013flu outbreak periods compared to nonoutbreak periods and tended to be greatest in adults aged \u226565 years during combined RSV\u2013flu outbreak periods.

MBL can bind to sugar determinants of a wide variety of microorganisms, neutralize them and inhibit infection by complement activation through the lectin pathway and opsonization by collectin receptors. Given that small intestine is a predominant site of extrahepatic expression of MBL, here we addressed the question whether MBL is involved in mucosal innate immunity. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) genes of mouse MBL-C (mMBL-C) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant mMBL-C-CRD binds to Shigella flexneri 2a in a calcium-dependent manner and that interaction could be blocked by the anti-mMBL-C-CRD antibody. mMBL-C-CRD protein could inhibit the adhesion of S. flexneri 2a to intestinal mucosa, while administration of anti-mMBL-C-CRD antibody caused an increased level of bacteria adhesion in vitro. Administration of recombinant mMBL-C-CRD protein reduced the secretion of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 from primary intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with S. flexneri 2a. Furthermore, neutralization of MBL activity by anti-MBL-C-CRD resulted in a significant increase in the number of S. flexneri 2a that colonized the intestines of BALB/c mice and attenuated the severity of inflammation seen in the areas of bacterial invasion. These findings suggest that mMBL-C may protect host intestinal mucosa by directly binding to the bacteria.","publish_time":"2009-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuo, Da-Ming; Zhang, Li-Yun; Lu, Xiao; Liu, Ying; Chen, Zheng-Liang","journal":"Int Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a32eb1d0e79a1482fd02c512786679b437f32c27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108602.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108602/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBL"],"locations":["Escherichia"],"keyphrases":["anti-MBL-C","c mice","administration of anti-mMBL-C","Administration of recombinant mMBL-C","CRD protein","genes of mouse MBL-C","CRD antibody","C-type serum lectin","neutralization of MBL activity","Shigella flexneri","predominant site of extrahepatic expression of MBL","lectin pathway","host intestinal mucosa","Mannan-binding lectin","monocyte chemoattractant protein","mucosal innate immunity","primary intestinal epithelial cells","increased level of bacteria adhesion","variety of pathogens","wide variety of microorganisms","secretion of IL","opsonization","sugar determinants","carbohydrate recognition domain","severity of inflammation","activation","collectin receptors","interaction","significant increase","calcium-dependent manner","small intestine","intestines of BALB","areas of bacterial invasion","infection","number","important role","question","findings","Escherichia coli"],"language":"en"},

Researchers believe that avian influenza has potential to evolve into one of the deadliest pandemics. Combating these diseases requires in\u2010depth knowledge of their epidemiology. An effective methodology for discovering epidemiological knowledge is to utilize a descriptive, evolutionary, ecological model and use bio\u2010simulations to study and analyze it. These types of bio\u2010simulations fall under the category of computational evolutionary methods because the individual entities participating in the simulation are permitted to evolve in a natural manner by reacting to changes in the simulated ecosystem. This work describes the application of the aforementioned methodology to discover epidemiological knowledge about avian influenza using a novel eco\u2010modeling and bio\u2010simulation environment called SEARUMS. The mathematical principles underlying SEARUMS, its design, and the procedure for using SEARUMS are discussed. The bio\u2010simulations and multi\u2010faceted case studies conducted using SEARUMS elucidate its ability to pinpoint timelines, epicenters, and socio\u2010economic impacts of avian influenza.

This report presents information on zoonotic pathogens in animal wastes and the generation, fate, and transport of bioaerosols associated with animal feeding operations and land applied manures. Though many bioaerosol studies have been conducted at animal production facilities, few have investigated the transport of bioaerosols during the land application of animal manures. As communities in rural areas converge with land application sites, concerns over bioaerosol exposure will certainly increase. Although most studies at animal operations and wastewater spray irrigation sites suggest a decreased risk of bioaerosol exposure with increasing distance from the source, many challenges remain in evaluating the health effects of aerosolized pathogens and allergens in outdoor environments. To improve our ability to understand the off-site transport and diffusion of human and livestock diseases, various dispersion models have been utilized. Most studies investigating the transport of bioaerosols during land application events have used a modified Gaussian plume model. Because of the disparity among collection and analytical techniques utilized in outdoor studies, it is often difficult to evaluate health effects associated with aerosolized pathogens and allergens. Invaluable improvements in assessing the health effects from intensive livestock practices could be made if standardized bioaerosol collection and analytical techniques, as well as the use of specific target microorganisms, were adopted.","publish_time":"2010-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dungan, R.

METHODS: The purposive random sampling method was used to administer questionnaires over a period of 6 months to HCWs and patients visiting the hospital. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients and 71 HCWs were sampled. One hundred and three (53.8%) patients had some knowledge of HAIs with 52 (28.4%) being informed by a HCW compared with 63 (88.7%) of HCWs who were well informed about HAIs. Ninety-seven (46.2%) responding patient always washed their hands while 65 (31%) and 48 (22.9%) respectively sometimes or never washed their hands within or after leaving the hospital. Out of those who washed their hands, 64 (39.5%) always washed with soap while 46 (28.4%) did sometimes. This positively and significantly correlated (r=0.440, P\u003C0.001) with knowledge on HAIs which was however insignificant in HCWs (r=0.025, P=0.835). As many as 48 (67.6%) of HCWs believed that authorities in the hospital had done little to prevent HAIs with the main reason being that the hospital was unclean.

The recombinantly expressed rabies virus phosphoprotein (RV\u2010P) and the anti\u2010staphylococcal protein A (anti\u2010SPA) polyclonal antibody were coated on the test (T) and control (C) lines on a nitrocellulose membrane, respectively. This layout is designed such that the polyclonal antibody in canine serum is captured by the colloidal gold\u2013SPA conjugates, before the rabies antibody complex is specifically selected by the RV\u2010P deposited on the T line, forming a \u2018sandwich\u2019 pattern. Unbound excess colloidal SPA then proceeds to the control line where SPA specifically interacts with the anti\u2010SPA antibody, producing a red precipitation at the C line, indicating the validity of the strip. We tested 165 canine serum samples with the strips, and the results were compared with those obtained using ELISA. The specificity and sensitivity of ICTS were found to be 93\u00B71 and 92\u00B72%, respectively. As a rapid technique, not demanding expensive instrumentation, the strip offers potential in disease monitoring, especially in rabies\u2010endemic developing countries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Simple and cheap techniques to detect rabies virus or monitor immunity against it are central in maintaining epidemiological control over the disease, particularly in endemic developing countries. While many techniques meet this requirement, they are confined to this usage as they are time\u2010consuming and demand expensive instrumentation. Our immunochromatographic test strip can detect rabies antibody with high specificity and sensitivity; the output can be measured with naked eye. It allows safe and quick detection that will be of value in the surveillance of the immunization status of potential targets in rabies\u2010endemic regions and will aid disease control.","publish_time":"2014-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tao, C.; Li, G.","journal":"Lett Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/553032d08569566cdb62a2ea9d377fce1f3cec9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165885.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/lam.12282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of rabies antibody","anti\u2010SPA antibody","rabies antibody complex","polyclonal antibody","SPA conjugates","disease control","control line","immunochromatographic test strip","Unbound excess colloidal SPA","canine serum samples","colloidal gold","C line","epidemiological control","T line","recombinantly expressed rabies virus phosphoprotein","anti\u2010staphylococcal protein","endemic developing countries","endemic regions","disease monitoring","demand expensive instrumentation","high specificity","cheap techniques","quick detection","sensitivity of ICTS","immunization status of potential targets","red precipitation","STUDY","output","value","surveillance","lines","strips","IMPACT","nitrocellulose membrane","rapid technique","sandwich","immunity","validity","naked eye","SIGNIFICANCE","usage","pattern","results","requirement","layout","ELISA"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection and that CS may contribute to this complication. METHODS: We retrospectively selected all adult patients with confirmed H1N1 virus infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of two tertiary care hospitals from September 2009 to March 2011. Differences in baseline factors, risk factors, and outcome parameters were studied between patients with and without IPA. RESULTS: Of 40 critically ill patients with confirmed H1N1, 9 (23 %) developed IPA 3 days after ICU admission. Five patients had proven and four had probable IPA. Significantly more IPA patients received CS within 7 days before ICU admission (78 versus 23 %, p = 0.002). IPA patients also received significantly higher doses of CS before ICU admission [hydrocortisone equivalent 800 (360\u20132,635) versus 0 (0\u20130) mg, p = 0.005]. On multivariate analysis, use of CS before ICU admission was independently associated with IPA [odds ratio (OR) 14.4 (2.0\u2013101.6), p = 0.007]. CONCLUSIONS: IPA was diagnosed in 23 % of critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection after a median of 3 days after ICU admission. Our data suggest that use of CS 7 days before ICU admission is an independent risk factor for fungal superinfection. These findings may have consequences for clinical practice as they point out the need for increased awareness of IPA, especially in those critically ill H1N1 patients already receiving CS.","publish_time":"2012-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wauters, Joost; Baar, Ingrid; Meersseman, Philippe; Meersseman, Wouter; Dams, Karolien; De Paep, Rudi; Lagrou, Katrien; Wilmer, Alexander; Jorens, Philippe; Hermans, Greet","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a99c4b9e539ac13e666430236b3483c72b79154f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079899.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-012-2673-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22895826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CS","IPA","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IPA patients","ill patients","ill H1N1 patients","ICU admission","adult patients","probable IPA","confirmed H1N1 virus infection","days","use of CS","increased awareness of IPA","higher doses of CS","risk factors","baseline factors","frequent complication","independent risk factor","intensive care unit","tertiary care hospitals","severe respiratory failure secondary","median","viral pneumonia","outcome parameters","fungal superinfection","controversial role","need","Differences","hydrocortisone equivalent","clinical practice","invasive pulmonary aspergillosis","findings","consequences","corticosteroids","multivariate analysis","PURPOSE","odds ratio","data","RESULTS","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

As the method is based on the common presence of restriction sites, it results in the generation of reproducible, species-specific amplification patterns. The method allows amplification and identification of viral RNA/DNA, with a lower cutoff value of 10(5) copies/ml for DNA viruses and 10(6) copies/ml for the RNA viruses.

Here we report early accumulation of fibrillar collagen in the glomerular mesangium of male ACE2 mutant (ACE2(\u2212/y)) mice followed by development of glomerulosclerosis by 12 months of age whereas female ACE2 mutant (ACE2(\u2212/\u2212)) mice were relatively protected. Progressive kidney injury was associated with increased deposition of collagen I, collagen III and fibronectin in the glomeruli and increased urinary albumin excretion compared to age-matched control mice. These structural and functional changes in the glomeruli of male ACE2 mutant mice were prevented by treatment with the angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist irbesartan. Loss of ACE2 was associated with a marked increase in renal lipid peroxidation product formation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 in glomeruli, events that are also prevented by angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockade. We conclude that deletion of the ACE2 gene leads to the development of angiotensin II-dependent glomerular injury in male mice.

They were isolated temporarily in a local hospital in Enping city, Guangdong province, where their clinical data were recorded and urine and saliva were collected to isolate ZIKV and to obtain viral sequences.

Together with the climatic features in Venezuela, New York and Guangdong in February, it can be concluded that our subjects are imported cases from Venezuela. With the same viral sequence being shared between family members, neither direct human-to-human nor vector transmission can be ruled out in this study, but the former seems more likely.

To be noted that, for the non-periodic infectious diseases, many people hope to obtain the vaccine of epidemics in time to be inoculated, rather than at the end of the epidemic. However, the vaccine may fail as a result of invalid storage, transportation and usage, and then vaccinated individuals may become re-susceptible and be infected again during the outbreak. To this end, we build a new framework that considers the imperfect vaccination during the one cycle of infectious disease within the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. Meanwhile, we propose a new vaccination update rule: myopic update rule, which is only based on one focal player\u2019s own perception regarding the disease outbreak, and one susceptible individual makes a decision to adopt the vaccine just by comparing the perceived payoffs vaccination with the perceived ones of being infected. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the imperfect vaccination behavior under the myopic update rule in the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. The results indicate that healthy individuals are often willing to inoculate the vaccine under the myopic update rule, which can stop the infectious disease from being spread, in particular, it is found that the vaccine efficacy influences the fraction of vaccinated individuals much more than the relative cost of vaccination on the regular lattice, Meanwhile, vaccine efficacy is more sensitive on the heterogeneous scale-free network. Current results are helpful to further analyze and model the choice of vaccination strategy during the disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Jiechen; Wang, Juan; Xia, Chengyi","journal":"Chaos, Solitons \u0026 Fractals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd4fc9d981f442dbc210a67500cabf238e259801.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111283.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288356/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077919303662; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2019.109425; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077919303662","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new vaccination update rule","vaccine efficacy","myopic update rule","vaccine of epidemics","cycle of infectious disease","diffusion of infectious disease","perceived payoffs vaccination","imperfect vaccination behavior","disease outbreaks","relative cost of vaccination","choice of vaccination strategy","heterogeneous population","healthy individuals","fraction of vaccinated individuals","end","non-periodic infectious diseases","perceived ones","new framework","heterogeneous scale-free network","susceptible individual","Current results","intriguing topic","regular lattice","people","transportation","result of invalid storage","usage","perception","field of public hygienics","focal player\u2019s","Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations","decision","time"],"language":"en"},

This chapter discusses various nonparenteral routes of administration. The oral route of administration is the most preferred and patient compliant method of them all. Transdermal, buccal, and pulmonary routes are also discussed. We have developed novel technologies using nanoparticles and microparticles to deliver vaccines by the oral and transdermal route of administration. These new technologies enable the formulation of vaccine particles containing vaccine antigens, without loss of their biological activity during the formulation process. Also, multiple antigens, targeting ligands and adjuvants can all be encapsulated within the same particle. When administered orally, these particles are designed to withstand the acidic environment of the stomach and are targeted to the Peyer\u2019s patches and the gut-associated mucosal immune system. Because these vaccines are particulate in nature, they are readily taken up by phagocytic antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as M cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the Peyer\u2019s patches of the intestines, resulting in a strong immune response and antibody production. Of particular interest is the fact that the particles release the antigen in a slow and sustained manner over a prolonged time period, intracellularly into APCs, resulting in strong mucosal and systemic immunity after oral administration, without the need for added adjuvants that are typically present in current vaccine preparations. Because no needles are required for oral vaccines, this method of vaccine delivery is inexpensive and suitable for mass vaccination in the developing world as well as for the developed world. This chapter discusses studies conducted on a wide array of vaccines, including infectious disease vaccines and cancer vaccines. This method of vaccine delivery enables the delivery of a wide spectrum of vaccines for prophylactic and therapeutic use, including oral and transdermal vaccines for cancer such as human papillomavirus, melanoma, ovarian, breast, and prostate with encouraging results. With respect to cancer therapy, a comparison is made between the conventional cancer therapy and immunotherapy. With a wide range of nanocarriers available for delivery of biologics, vaccines, and cancer therapies, nanotechnology not only has gained the well-deserved limelight but has also attracted the attention of regulatory bodies, although it presents certain challenges that must be considered before marketing such nanocarriers.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u2019Souza, Martin J.; Gala, Rikhav P.; Ubale, Ruhi V.; D\u2019Souza, Bernadette; Vo, Trinh Phuong; Parenky, Ashwin C.; Mulla, Nihal S.; D\u2019Sa, Sucheta; D\u2019Souza, Marissa; Braz-Gomes, Kim; D\u2019Souza, Nigel; Chiriva-Internati, Maurizio; Zughaier, Susu","journal":"Novel Approaches and Strategies for Biologics, Vaccines and Cancer Therapies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f6c1cccdaf6a2a22ffdd30f2eeadba5f063c30f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150203.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124166035000055; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124166035000055","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oral vaccines","cancer vaccines","transdermal vaccines","wide array of vaccines","wide spectrum of vaccines","oral administration","infectious disease vaccines","method of vaccine delivery","oral route of administration","vaccine antigens","formulation of vaccine particles","delivery of biologics","cancer therapies","transdermal route of administration","conventional cancer therapy","current vaccine preparations","various nonparenteral routes of administration","nonparenteral biologics","human use","APCs","dendritic cells","Peyer\u2019s patches","adjuvants","chapter","developed world","wide range of nanocarriers available","strong immune response","mucosal immune system","patient compliant method","human papillomavirus","therapeutic use","formulation process","multiple antigens","phagocytic antigen","novel technologies","pulmonary routes","new technologies","developing world","breast","sustained manner","development","mass vaccination","prolonged time period","melanoma","gut","loss","advancement","macrophages","comparison","microparticles","systemic immunity","biological activity","prostate","antibody production","nanoparticles","intestines","nanotechnology","attention of regulatory bodies","Abstract Recent years","encouraging results","stomach","ligands","fact","studies","immunotherapy","respect","certain challenges","acidic environment","well-deserved limelight","nature","needles"],"language":"en"},

Although this high dose conferred fatal respiratory disease in mice, achieving similar pathology at lower viral doses may more closely reflect naturally acquired infections. Through continued adaptive evolution of icMERSma1 we generated a novel mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (maM35c4) capable of achieving severe respiratory disease at doses between 103 and 105 PFU. Novel mutations were identified in the maM35c4 genome that may be responsible for eliciting etiologies of acute respiratory distress syndrome at 10\u20131000 fold lower viral doses. Importantly, comparative genetics of the two mouse-adapted MERS strains allowed us to identify specific mutations that remained fixed through an additional 20 cycles of adaptive evolution. Our data indicate that the extent of MERS-CoV adaptation determines the minimal infectious dose required to achieve severe respiratory disease.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Douglas, Madeline G.; Kocher, Jacob F.; Scobey, Trevor; Baric, Ralph S.; Cockrell, Adam S.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87f298621a5431d6978dac04bd70a6abc0418dd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5869108.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217304117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29277291/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217304117; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.12.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory disease","severe respiratory disease","fatal respiratory disease","novel mouse-adapted MERS-CoV","mouse-adapted MERS strains","high dose","extent of MERS","mouse model","CoV adaptation","fold lower viral doses","Novel mutations","PFU","eliciting etiologies of acute respiratory distress syndrome","continued adaptive evolution of icMERSma1","minimal infectious dose","cycles of adaptive evolution","similar pathology","human pathology","maM35c4 genome","specific mutations","mice","comparative genetics","data","infections"],"language":"en"},

There are multiple murine models of severe respiratory viral infections that have been used to identify viral and host factors that contribute to disease severity. Primary cultures of murine alveolar epithelial cells provide a robust in vitro model to perform mechanistic studies that can be correlated with in vivo studies to identify cell type-specific factors that contribute to pathology within the alveoli of the lung during viral infection. In this study, we established an in vitro model to compare the responses of type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) alveolar epithelial cells to infection by respiratory viruses used in murine models: mouse-adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV, v2163), murine coronavirus MHV-1, and influenza A (H1N1) virus, strain PR8. Murine alveolar cells cultured to maintain an ATII cell phenotype, determined by expression of LBP180, were susceptible to infection by all three viruses. In contrast, ATII cells that were cultured to trans-differentiate into an ATI-like cell phenotype were susceptible to MHV-1 and PR8, but not mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. Epithelial cells produce cytokines in response to viral infections, thereby activating immune responses. Thus, virus-induced cytokine expression was quantified in ATI and ATII cells. Both cell types had increased expression of IL-1\u03B2 mRNA upon viral infection, though at different levels. While MHV-1 and PR8 induced expression of a number of shared cytokines in ATI cells, there were several cytokines whose expression was induced uniquely by MHV-1 infection. In summary, ATI and ATII cells exhibited differential susceptibilities and cytokine responses to infection by respiratory viruses. This in vitro model will be critical for future studies to determine the roles of these specialized cell types in the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infection.","publish_time":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kebaabetswe, Lemme P.; Haick, Anoria K.; Miura, Tanya A.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d696b29f67616ddf49b71564181dccf4d1adba9c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9bd30dec1a2172cbae1eebfc65c3411cad56455b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3683362.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639425/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3683362?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213001251; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.04.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213001251","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ATII","ATI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ATI cells","ATII cells","Murine alveolar cells","pathogenesis of respiratory viral infection","respiratory viruses","ATII cell phenotype","multiple murine models of severe respiratory viral infections","murine coronavirus MHV","PR8 induced expression","Primary cultures of murine alveolar epithelial cells","expression of LBP180","virus-induced cytokine expression","responses of type","cell type-specific factors","specialized cell types","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","cytokine responses","increased expression of IL","immune responses","future studies","mouse","mechanistic studies","strain PR8","adapted SARS-CoV","alveoli","number of shared cytokines","host factors","differential susceptibilities","v2163","\u03B2 mRNA","roles","spread","pathology","H1N1","influenza","disease severity","different levels","summary","lungs","contrast","study"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A total of 1,015 canine serum samples were randomly selected from submissions to a diagnostic laboratory between March and December 2014, and were analysed for CRCoV antibodies using a competitive ELISA. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations between seroprevalence of CRCoV and breed category, age, sex, sampling month, region, and reported health status of dogs. Results: Overall, 538/1,015 (53.0%) samples were seropositive for CRCoV, with 492/921 (53.4%) positive dogs in the North Island and 46/94 (49%) in the South Island. Age of dog, sampling month, region, and presence of abnormal respiratory signs were included in the initial logistic regression model. Seroprevalence was higher in dogs aged \u22653 compared with \u22642 years (p \u003C 0.01). The lowest seroprevalence was observed in July (30/105; 28.5%) and August (32/100; 32%), and the highest in June (74/100; 74%). Seroprevalence in dogs from Auckland was higher than in dogs from the Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Marlborough, and Waikato regions (p \u003C 0.05). Abnormal respiratory signs (coughing, nasal discharge, or sneezing) were reported for 28/1,015 (2.8%) dogs sampled. Seroprevalence for CRCoV tended to be higher among dogs with respiratory signs (67.9 (95% CI = 47.6\u201383.4)%) than dogs with no reported respiratory signs (52.6 (95% CI = 49.5\u201355.7)%). Conclusions: Serological evidence of infection with CRCoV was present in more than half of the dogs tested from throughout New Zealand. Differences in CRCoV seroprevalence between regions and lack of seasonal pattern indicate that factors other than external temperatures may be important in the epidemiology of CRCoV in New Zealand. Clinical relevance: Our data suggest that CRCoV should be included in investigations of cases of infectious canine tracheobronchitis, particularly if these occur among dogs vaccinated with current vaccines, which do not include CRCoV antigens.","publish_time":"2019-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"More, GD; Dunowska, M; Acke, E; Cave, NJ","journal":"N Z Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4d5af20883113bf88adb2592e4a0e2239cc63a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113908.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513753/; https://doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2019.1667282","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North Island","South Island","Auckland","Hawkes Bay","New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["seroprevalence of CRCoV","CRCoV seroprevalence","positive dogs","New Zealand dogs","epidemiology of CRCoV","CRCoV antibodies","CRCoV antigens","reported respiratory signs","seroprevalence of canine respiratory coronavirus","reported health status of dogs","lowest seroprevalence","presence of abnormal respiratory signs","sampling month","reported presence of clinical signs suggestive of respiratory disease","geographical region of sampling","sex","associations","Age of dog","canine serum samples","infectious canine tracheobronchitis","Logistic regression analysis","breed category","Waikato regions","Clinical relevance","initial logistic regression model","North Island","South Island","Marlborough","Manawatu","coughing","nasal discharge","lack of seasonal pattern","factors","Serological evidence of infection","investigations of cases","Hawkes Bay","external temperatures","submissions","total","Auckland","Conclusions","sneezing","competitive ELISA","data","half","Differences","current vaccines","diagnostic laboratory","Methods","years","Results"],"language":"en"},

Recent evidence suggests that IFITMs block virus hemifusion (lipid mixing in the absence of viral content release) by altering the properties of cell membranes. Consistent with this mechanism, excess cholesterol in late endosomes of IFITM-expressing cells has been reported to inhibit IAV entry. Here, we examined IAV restriction by IFITM3 protein using direct virus-cell fusion assay and single virus imaging in live cells. IFITM3 over-expression did not inhibit lipid mixing, but abrogated the release of viral content into the cytoplasm. Although late endosomes of IFITM3-expressing cells accumulated cholesterol, other interventions leading to aberrantly high levels of this lipid did not inhibit virus fusion. These results imply that excess cholesterol in late endosomes is not the mechanism by which IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to full fusion. The IFITM3\u0027s ability to block fusion pore formation at a post-hemifusion stage shows that this protein stabilizes the cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes without adversely affecting the lumenal leaflet. We propose that IFITM3 interferes with pore formation either directly, through partitioning into the cytoplasmic leaflet of a hemifusion intermediate, or indirectly, by modulating the lipid/protein composition of this leaflet. Alternatively, IFITM3 may redirect IAV fusion to a non-productive pathway, perhaps by promoting fusion with intralumenal vesicles within multivesicular bodies/late endosomes.","publish_time":"2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desai, Tanay M.; Marin, Mariana; Chin, Christopher R.; Savidis, George; Brass, Abraham L.; Melikyan, Gregory B.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcef588534b114e24a8c93a3eeeba8c1d11dd8a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3974867.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["late endosomes of IFITM3","virus fusion","IAV fusion","IFITM3 protein","fusion pore formation","IFITMs block virus hemifusion","direct virus-cell fusion assay","lipid mixing","IFITM3 over-expression","excess cholesterol","hemifusion intermediate","IAV restriction","lumenal leaflet","IAV entry","single virus imaging","cells accumulated cholesterol","cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes","post-hemifusion stage","live cells","protein composition","mechanism","release of viral content","absence of viral content release","properties of cell membranes","multivesicular bodies","intralumenal vesicles","infection of diverse enveloped viruses","interventions","influenza","s ability","Recent evidence","transmembrane proteins","partitioning","non-productive pathway","transition","Interferon","high levels","results"],"language":"en"},

Pandemic prevention strategies must be based on preparing for the unexpected and being capable of reacting accordingly. There is growing evidence that infection control measures were helpful in containment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as avian influenza. Compliance of standard infection control measures, intensive promotion of hand and respiratory hygiene, vigilance and triage of patients with febrile illness, and specific infection control measures are key components to contain a highly contagious disease in hospital and to protect healthcare workers, patients and visitors. The importance of standard precautions for any patient and cleaning and disinfection for the healthcare environment cannot be overemphasized.

However, using conventional diagnostic techniques, a causative agent is not always found. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) allows analysis of the complete virome, but has not yet been applied in COPD exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: To study the respiratory virome in nasopharyngeal samples during COPD exacerbations using mNGS. STUDY DESIGN: 88 nasopharyngeal swabs from 63 patients from the Bergen COPD Exacerbation Study (2006\u20132010) were analysed by mNGS and in-house qPCR for respiratory viruses. Both DNA and RNA were sequenced simultaneously using an Illumina library preparation protocol with in-house adaptations. RESULTS: By mNGS, 24/88 samples tested positive. Sensitivity and specificity, as compared with PCR, were 96% and 98% for diagnostic targets (23/24 and 1093/1120, respectively). Additional viral pathogens detected by mNGS were herpes simplex virus type 1 and coronavirus OC43. A positive correlation was found between Cq value and mNGS viral normalized species reads (log value) (p = 0.002). Patients with viral pathogens had lower percentages of bacteriophages (p\u003C0.001). No correlation was found between viral reads and clinical markers. CONCLUSIONS: The mNGS protocol used was highly sensitive and specific for semi-quantitative detection of respiratory viruses. Excellent negative predictive value implicates the power of mNGS to exclude any pathogenic respiratory viral infectious cause in one test, with consequences for clinical decision making. Reduced abundance of bacteriophages in COPD patients with viral pathogens implicates skewing of the virome during infection, with potential consequences for the bacterial populations, during infection.","publish_time":"2019-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Rijn, Anneloes L.; van Boheemen, Sander; Sidorov, Igor; Carbo, Ellen C.; Pappas, Nikos; Mei, Hailiang; Feltkamp, Mariet; Aanerud, Marianne; Bakke, Per; Claas, Eric C.

This confirmed that CCV and TGEV are distinct, but antigenically related coronaviruses. In sera from 41 dogs, CCV-neutralizing titres were on average 2.7 fold higher than TGEV-neutralizing titres, suggesting that CCV was the causal agent. Sera from 29 cats in colonies with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and known to contain TGEV-neutralizing antibody, were found to have titres 12.3 fold higher against CCV. The FIP virus (FIPV) is probably more closely related to CCV than TGEV as judged by antigens involved in virus neutralization. Antisera to two isolates of bovine coronavirus, three isolates of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus and the 229E strain of human coronavirus all failed to neutralize CCV and TGEV.

Apart from such microbiological agents associated with enteritis as bacteria and parasites, a lot of research has been recently conducted on viral origin of enteric diseases. However, enteric viruses have been identified in intestinal tract of not only diseased but also healthy poultry, so their role in enteritis is still unclear. The present study aimed at determination of the prevalence of four enteric viruses, namely astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus in meat-type turkey flocks in Poland as well as at statistical evaluation of the occurrence of the studied viruses and their relationships with the health status and the age of birds. Two hundred and seven flocks of birds aged 1-20 weeks originating from different regions of the country were investigated between 2008 and 2011. Clinical samples (10 individual faecal swabs/flock) were duly processed and examined using molecular methods targeting the conservative regions of viral genomes: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of astrovirus, non-structural 1 gene of parvovirus, non-structural protein 4 gene of rotavirus, and 5\u2032 untranslated region fragment of turkey coronavirus. Different statistical methods (i.e. the independence chi-square test, the correspondence analysis and the logistic regression model) were used to establish any relationships between the analyzed data. RESULTS: Overall, 137 (66.2%, 95% CI: 59.3-72.6) of the 207 turkey flocks sampled were infected with one or more enteric viruses. Among the 137 flocks, 74 (54%, 95% CI: 45.3-62.6) were positive for one virus, whereas 54 (39.4%, 9 5% CI: 31.2-48.1) and 9 (6.6%, 95% CI: 3.1-12.1) were co-infected with two or three different enteric viruses, respectively. No flock was simultaneously infected with all four viruses studied. The prevalence of astrovirus infection was 44.9% (95% CI: 38.0-52.0), parvovirus 27.5% (95% CI: 21.6-34.2), rotavirus 18.8% (95% CI: 13.8-24.8), and coronavirus 9.7% (95% CI: 6.0-14.5). Young turkeys aged 1-4 weeks old had the highest (82.1%, 95% CI:71.7-89.8) prevalence of viral infection. Applied statistical methods have indicated the dependence of rotavirus infection as well as the co-infection with multiple viruses and the health status of turkeys. Furthermore, our results statistically confirm that especially young birds are susceptible to infection with rotavirus and astrovirus. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the presence of astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus infections in Polish turkey farms. These viruses were detected in both healthy and diseased birds. However, the presented results provide valuable feedback which could help to evaluate the role of some enteric viruses in the etiology of enteritis in turkey.","publish_time":"2017-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doma\u0144ska-Blicharz, K.; Bocian, \u0141.; Lisowska, A.; Jacukowicz, A.; Piku\u0142a, A.; Minta, Z.","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d62acbb74aea7559783bcf556ce7352b55ca03a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5391614.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28410608/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1013-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Poland"],"keyphrases":["CI","different enteric viruses","studied viruses","multiple viruses","gene of rotavirus","prevalence of astrovirus infection","dependence of rotavirus infection","flocks of birds","prevalence of viral infection","gene of parvovirus","rotavirus infections","co-infection","viral origin of enteric diseases","presence of astrovirus","Different statistical methods","diseased birds","young birds","meat-type turkey flocks","different regions","age of birds","untranslated region fragment of turkey coronavirus","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of astrovirus","health status of turkeys","Polish turkey farms","healthy poultry","molecular methods","etiology of enteritis","statistical evaluation","relationships","Young turkeys","role","presented results","conservative regions of viral genomes","important health problem","non-structural protein","weeks old","present study","intensive poultry industry","correspondence analysis","independence chi-square test","Poland","individual faecal swabs","bacteria","Clinical samples","logistic regression model","considerable economic losses","parasites","determination","occurrence","intestinal tract","lot of research","valuable feedback","microbiological agents","BACKGROUND","analyzed data","CONCLUSIONS","country"],"language":"en"},

Policies of health organizations for healthcare workers are inconsistent, with a change in policy in the US for universal face mask use. The aim of this study was to review the evidence around the efficacy of masks and respirators for healthcare workers, sick patients and the general public. Methods A systematic review of randomized controlled clinical trials on use of respiratory protection by healthcare workers, sick patients and community members was conducted. Articles were searched on Medline and Embase using key search terms. Results A total of 19 randomised controlled trials were included in this study \u2013 8 in community settings, 6 in healthcare settings and 5 as source control. Most of these randomised controlled trials used different interventions and outcome measures. In the community, masks appeared to be more effective than hand hygiene alone, and both together are more protective. Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective. When used by sick patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection of well contacts. Conclusion The study suggests that community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic. The studies of masks as source control also suggest a benefit, and may be important during the COVID-19 pandemic in universal community face mask use as well as in health care settings.

Current knowledge regarding the genetic diversity, seasonality and transmission dynamics of HMPV among adults and children living in tropical climate remains limited. HMPV prevailed at 2.2% (n = 86/3,935) among individuals presented with acute respiratory tract infections in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between 2012 and 2014. Seasonal peaks were observed during the northeast monsoon season (November\u2013April) and correlated with higher relative humidity and number of rainy days (P \u003C 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis of the fusion and attachment genes identified the co-circulation of three known HMPV sub-lineages, A2b and B1 (30.2% each, 26/86) and B2 (20.9%, 18/86), with genotype shift from sub-lineage B1 to A2b observed in 2013. Interestingly, a previously unrecognized sub-lineage of A2 was identified in 18.6% (16/86) of the population. Using a custom script for network construction based on the TN93 pairwise genetic distance, we identified up to nine HMPV transmission clusters circulating as multiple sub-epidemics. Although no apparent major outbreak was observed, the increased frequency of transmission clusters (dyads) during seasonal peaks suggests the potential roles of transmission clusters in driving the spread of HMPV.

Responding to these threats requires improved surveillance and diagnostic systems. Despite their potential, genomic tools have not been readily applied to emerging or re-emerging plant pathogens such as the wheat yellow (stripe) rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST). This is due largely to the obligate parasitic nature of PST, as culturing PST isolates for DNA extraction remains slow and tedious. RESULTS: To counteract the limitations associated with culturing PST, we developed and applied a field pathogenomics approach by transcriptome sequencing infected wheat leaves collected from the field in 2013. This enabled us to rapidly gain insights into this emerging pathogen population. We found that the PST population across the United Kingdom (UK) underwent a major shift in recent years. Population genetic structure analyses revealed four distinct lineages that correlated to the phenotypic groups determined through traditional pathology-based virulence assays. Furthermore, the genetic diversity between members of a single population cluster for all 2013 PST field samples was much higher than that displayed by historical UK isolates, revealing a more diverse population of PST. CONCLUSIONS: Our field pathogenomics approach uncovered a dramatic shift in the PST population in the UK, likely due to a recent introduction of a diverse set of exotic PST lineages. The methodology described herein accelerates genetic analysis of pathogen populations and circumvents the difficulties associated with obligate plant pathogens. In principle, this strategy can be widely applied to a variety of plant pathogens.

All 12 cases of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count. The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity. ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury. Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity. Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury.

This suggests that the RBD may serve as an ideal vaccine candidate. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been proven to be an effective system for gene delivery and vaccine development. In this study, a novel vaccine against SARS-CoV was developed based on the rAAV delivery system. The gene encoding RBD was cloned into a pAAV-IRES-hrGFP plasmid. The immunogenicity induced by the resulting recombinant RBD-rAAV was evaluated in BALB/c mice. The results demonstrated that (1) a single dose of RBD-rAAV vaccination could induce sufficient neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV infection; (2) two more repeated doses of the vaccination boosted the neutralizing antibody to about 5 times of the level achieved by a single dose of the immunization and (3) the level of the antibody continued to increase for the entire duration of the experiment of 5.5 months.

Nevertheless, it has not been reported as the cause of acute myocarditis or fulminant myocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old male was admitted with pneumonia and cardiac symptoms. He was genetically confirmed as having COVID-19 according to sputum testing on the day of admission. He also had elevated troponin I (Trop I) level (up to 11.37 g/L) and diffuse myocardial dyskinesia along with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on echocardiography. The highest level of interleukin-6 was 272.40 pg/ml. Bedside chest radiographs showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia. Laboratory test results for viruses that cause myocarditis were all negative. The patient conformed to the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese expert consensus statement for fulminant myocarditis. After receiving antiviral therapy and mechanical life support, Trop I was reduced to 0.10 g/L, and interleukin-6 was reduced to 7.63 pg/mL. Moreover, the LVEF of the patient gradually recovered to 68%. The patient died of aggravation of secondary infection on the 33rd day of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients may develop severe cardiac complications such as myocarditis and heart failure. This is the first report of COVID-19 complicated with fulminant myocarditis.

Damage/danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are normal intracellular components or metabolites that, when released from cells, signal cellular damage/lysis. Purine metabolite DAMPs, including extracellular ATP and adenosine, inhibit chlamydial development in a species-specific manner. Viral co-infection has been shown to reversibly abrogate Chlamydia inclusion development, suggesting persistence/chlamydial stress. Because viral infection can cause host cell DAMP release, we hypothesized DAMPs may influence chlamydial development. Therefore, we examined the effect of extracellular ATP, adenosine, and cyclic AMP exposure, at 0 and 14 hours post infection, on C. pecorum and C. trachomatis serovar E development. In the absence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post or at 14 hours post infection reduced inclusion size; however, the effect was less robust upon 14 hours post infection exposure. Additionally, upon exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection, bacteria per inclusion and subsequent infectivity were reduced in both Chlamydia species. These effects were reversible, and C. pecorum exhibited more pronounced recovery from DAMP exposure. Aberrant bodies, typical in virus-induced chlamydial persistence, were absent upon DAMP exposure. In the presence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection reduced inclusion size, but only variably modulated chlamydial infectivity. Because chlamydial infection and other infections may increase local DAMP concentrations, DAMPs may influence Chlamydia infection in vivo, particularly in the context of poly-microbial infections.","publish_time":"2015-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leonard, Cory Ann; Schoborg, Robert V.; Borel, Nicole","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/078b6935fa30cd20a00da6c6182e85b41ab4d9c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4527707.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26248286/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chlamydial infection","infection exposure","chlamydial development","Chlamydia infection","DAMP exposure","chlamydial persistence","viral infection","chlamydial infectivity","Viral co-infection","Chlamydia inclusion development","chlamydial stress response","Purine metabolite DAMPs","cyclic AMP exposure","inclusion size","hours","characteristic chlamydial biphasic developmental cycle","novo host protein synthesis","host cell DAMP release","pecorum","adenosine","effect of extracellular ATP","local DAMP concentrations","Chlamydia species","trachomatis serovar E development","microbial infections","subsequent infectivity","cellular damage","divergence","molecular patterns","normal intracellular components","virus","bacteria","metabolites","non-infectious state","cells","danger","presence","absence","pronounced recovery","context of poly","Aberrant bodies","lysis","species-specific manner","effects"],"language":"en"},

Eighteen strains of influenza C virus were detected in these samples using a combined tissue culture/RT\u2010PCR diagnostic method. Most patients with influenza C virus infection (13/18) were infants or young children (\u003C2 years of age). The most frequent symptoms were fever and cough, and the clinical presentation of influenza C virus infection was similar to that of other respiratory viruses. Thirteen of the 18 infected patients were hospitalized; 3 presented with a severe lower respiratory infection. The hemagglutinin\u2010esterase (HE) gene of 10 isolates was sequenced to determine the lineages of the circulating influenza C viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the isolated strains had an HE gene belonging to the C/Yamagata/26/81\u2010related lineage. These results show that influenza C virus regularly circulates in Normandy and generally causes a mild upper respiratory infection. Because the differential clinical diagnosis of influenza C virus infection is not always easy, it is important to identify viral strains for both patient management and epidemiological purposes. J.

The present study evaluated the contributions of CCR5 to the activation and trafficking of virus-specific CD8\u002B T cells into the MHV-infected CNS mice. Comparable numbers of virus-specific CD8\u002B T cells derived from immunized CCR5\u002B/\u002B or CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice were present within the CNS of MHV-infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice following adoptive transfer, indicating that CCR5 is not required for trafficking of these cells into the CNS.

To simulate the natural transmission of different kinds of animals in LBMs, we selected three representative NDVs\u2014namely, GM, YF18, and GZ289\u2014isolated from different birds to evaluate the pathogenicity and transmission of the indicated viruses in chickens, ducks, and pigeons. Furthermore, to investigate the replication and shedding of NDV in poultry, we inoculated the chickens, ducks, and pigeons with 10(6) EID(50) of each virus via intraocular and intranasal routes. Eight hour after infection, the na\u00EFve contact groups were housed with those inoculated with each of the viruses as a means to monitor contact transmission. Our results indicated that genetically diverse viruses circulate in LBMs in South China\u0027s Guangdong Province and that NDV from different birds have different tissue tropisms and host ranges when transmitted in different birds. We therefore propose the continuous epidemiological surveillance of LBMs to support the prevention of the spread of these viruses in different birds, especially chickens, and highlight the need for studies of the virus\u2013host relationship.","publish_time":"2016-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Yinfeng; Xiang, Bin; Yuan, Runyu; Zhao, Xiaqiong; Feng, Minsha; Gao, Pei; Li, Yanling; Li, Yulian; Ning, Zhangyong; Ren, Tao","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0e52525fd4deb91e0fc1fd94e9453fddce62905.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4746259.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26903997/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV","GM"],"locations":["China","South China"],"keyphrases":["different birds","chickens","contact transmission","ducks","indicated viruses","pigeons","sources of transmission","natural transmission of different kinds of animals","different tissue tropisms","NDV isolates","diverse viruses","continuous epidemiological surveillance of LBMs","poultry","Newcastle disease virus","host ranges","host relationship","high pathogenicity","avian species","various wild bird species","live bird markets","na\u00EFve contact groups","H7N9 surveillance program","South China\u0027s Guangdong Province","GZ289","GM","infection","YF18","studies","mode","prevention","spread","representative NDVs","hour","intranasal routes","need","means","results","study","replication","EID"],"language":"en"},

The results give insight into variations in the underlying mechanisms as a function of the substitution pattern. This is of interest for the mechanisms of inhibition of the SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS\u2010CoV M(pro)) by etacrynic acid derivatives as well as for the excess toxicity of substituted \u03B1,\u03B2\u2010unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This study compares possible reaction courses including 1,4\u2010addition followed by a ketonization step, and underscores the importance of a base\u2010catalyzed step for the reactivity of thiol groups in enzymes. Phenyl and methyl substituents at the Michael system decrease the reactivity of the electrophilic compound, but chlorophenyl substituents partly recover the reactivity. Computations also indicate that electron\u2010pushing substituents lead to a change in the reaction mechanism. The conformation of the Michael system is also found to significantly influence reactivity: the s\u2010cis conformation leads to higher reactivity than the s\u2010trans conformation. The computed data explain the trends in measured inhibition potencies of substituted \u03B1,\u03B2\u2010unsaturated carbonyl compounds and of reaction rates in chemical assays. They also indicate that the reversibility of inhibition does not stand in contrast to the formation of a new covalent bond between inhibitor and protease.","publish_time":"2010-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paasche, Alexander; Schiller, Markus; Schirmeister, Tanja; Engels, Bernd","journal":"ChemMedChem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fb027c2f02c2058205e1d3b58b64eaef15b51da.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a9efeab1a3e7cbc58c0bd69992602405f57acc48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162195.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20401893/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.201000020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unsaturated carbonyl compounds","higher reactivity","mechanisms of inhibition","reactivity of thiol groups","measured inhibition potencies of substituted \u03B1","excess toxicity of substituted \u03B1","Michael systems","reaction rates","reversibility of inhibition","cis conformation","reaction mechanism","chlorophenyl substituents","methyl substituents","trans conformation","computations","possible reaction courses","SARS coronavirus main protease","catalyzed step","ketonization step","underlying mechanisms","trends","new covalent bond","importance","addition","thiols","electrophilic compound","function","insight","variations","inhibitor","base","computed data","chemical assays","etacrynic acid derivatives","study","contrast","enzymes","change","reactions","substitution pattern","results","chemoassays","electron"],"language":"en"},

To this end, fertilized oocytes and morulae were exposed to different concentrations of MMVp for 16 h, while 2-cell embryos and blastocysts were coincubated for 1 h. In addition, morulae were exposed to MHV-A59 for 16 h. One group of embryos was washed, and the remaining embryos remained unwashed before embryo transfer. Serological analyses were performed by means of ELISA to detect antibodies to MHV or MMV in recipients and in progeny on Days 14, 21, 28, 42, and 63 and on Days 42, 63, 84, 112, 133, and 154, respectively, after embryo transfer.

One candidate for the development of a subunit vaccine is the Y. pestis virulence (V) antigen, a protein that mediates the function of the Yersinia outer protein virulence factors and suppresses inflammatory responses in the host. On the basis of the knowledge that adenovirus (Ad) gene-transfer vectors act as adjuvants in eliciting host immunity against the transgene they carry, we tested the hypothesis that a single administration of a replication-defective Ad gene-transfer vector encoding the Y. pestis V antigen (AdsecV) could stimulate strong protective immune responses without a requirement for repeat administration. AdsecV elicited specific T cell responses and high IgG titers in serum within 2 weeks after a single intramuscular immunization. Importantly, the mice were protected from a lethal intranasal challenge of Y. pestis CO92 from 4 weeks up to 6 months after immunization with a single intramuscular dose of AdsecV. These observations suggest that an Ad gene-transfer vector expressing V antigen is a candidate for development of an effective anti-plague vaccine","publish_time":"2006-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiuchiolo, Maria J.; Boyer, Julie L.; Krause, Anja; Senina, Svetlana; Hackett, Neil R.; Crystal, Ronald G.","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b82a7e289836a97e6d2bc4edd7850bdbfa339160.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109909.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109909/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzYz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["pestis V antigen","pestis virulence","pestis CO92","single administration","gene-transfer vectors","bacterium Yersinia pestis","single intramuscular immunization","single intramuscular dose of AdsecV","replication-defective Ad gene-transfer vector","inflammatory responses","pneumonic plague","weeks","development","plague vaccines","candidate","effective anti-plague vaccine","Yersinia outer protein virulence factors","specific T cell responses","strong protective immune responses","subunit vaccine","repeat administration","eliciting host immunity","high IgG titers","requirement","adjuvants","serum","use","function","adenovirus","lethal intranasal challenge of","aerosol form","knowledge","months","United States","transgene","fatal disease","present","mice","basis","hypothesis","observations"],"language":"en"},

Virus isolation identified 12 infections, 8 in one season, 4 in another. Complement fixing (CF) antibody titer rises identified 133 infections that occurred in all six seasons of surveillance, involving from 15 to 35% of students in three seasons of \u201Chigh\u201D prevalence, and 1 to 5% in intervening seasons of \u201Clow\u201D prevalence. Infection occurred in a winter-spring seasonal pattern and was associated with acute respiratory illness that was not clinically distinctive. Neutralizing antibody to 229E was commonly present in the sera of the students. The level of this did not appear to influence the occurrence of, or likelihood of illness with, reinfection as judged by CF seroconversion; however, the frequency of significant rise in neutralizing antibody titer with reinfection was inversely related to pre-infection levels of this antibody. Infection with other common respiratory viruses did not stimulate significant CF or neutralizing antibody titer rises to 229E.","publish_time":"1972-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"HAMRE, DOROTHY; BEEM, MARC","journal":"Am J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c19ddc0f5eeef28094e7f239b668683da15744c1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109916/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["V.

Biopsies of the olfactory mucosa in patients that complain of dysosmia after viral infection fall into two categories: one in which no olfactory epithelium is seen and another in which the epithelium is disordered and populated mainly by immature neurons. We have used intranasal inoculation with an olfactory bulb line variant of MHV to study the consequences of viral infection on peripheral olfactory structures. MHV OBLV has little direct effect on the olfactory epithelium, but causes extensive spongiotic degeneration and destruction of mitral cells and interneurons in the olfactory bulb such that the axonal projection from the bulb via the lateral olfactory tract is markedly reduced. Moreover, surviving mitral cells apparently remain disconnected from the sensory neuron input to the glomerular layer, judging from retrograde labeling studies using Dil. The damage to the bulb indirectly causes a persistent, long-term increase in the turnover of sensory neurons in the epithelium, i.e. the relative proportion of immature to mature sensory neurons and the rate of basal cell proliferation both increase. The changes that develop after inoculation with MHV OBLV closely resemble the disordering of the olfactory epithelium in some patient biopsies. Thus, damage to the olfactory nerve or bulb may contribute to a form of post-viral olfactory dysfunction and MHV OBLV is a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of this form of dysosmia.","publish_time":"2001-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwob, James E.; Saha, Sucharita; Youngentob, Steven L.; Jubelt, Burk","journal":"Chem Senses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110028.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110028/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzE0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV","MHV OBLV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["olfactory epithelium","olfactory mucosa","olfactory nerve","olfactory bulb line variant of MHV","peripheral olfactory structures","lateral olfactory tract","form of post-viral olfactory dysfunction","MHV OBLV","common cause of clinical olfactory dysfunction","consequences of viral infection","pathogenesis of dysosmia","form of dysosmia","immature neurons","turnover of sensory neurons","Viral upper respiratory infections","damage","sensory neuron input","destruction of mitral cells","intranasal inoculation","long-term increase","patient biopsies","relative proportion of immature","glomerular layer","extensive spongiotic degeneration","interneurons","patients","retrograde labeling studies","direct effect","useful model","axonal projection","rate of basal cell proliferation","disordering","categories","changes"],"language":"en"},

Half of patients were identified to be related to a new subgenotype C3. One unique amino acid mutation at I507 L in spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) was detected, which segregated this subgenotype C3 from other known subgenotypes.

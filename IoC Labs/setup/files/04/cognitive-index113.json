In this study, full-length Vpu (M group) from clone NL4-3 was over-expressed in human cells and purified in an oligomeric state. Various single and double mutations were constructed on its phosphorylation sites to mimic different degrees of phosphorylation. Size exclusion chromatography of wild-type Vpu and mutants indicated that the smallest assembly unit of Vpu was a dimer and over time Vpu formed higher oligomers. The rate of oligomerization increased when (i) the degree of phosphorylation at serines 52 and 56 was decreased and (ii) when the ionic strength was increased indicating that the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu affects oligomerization. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations with models of wild-type and mutant Vpu in a hydrated lipid bilayer supported the experimental data in demonstrating that, in addition to a previously known role in downregulation of host factors, the phosphorylation sites of Vpu also modulate oligomerization.","publish_time":"2016-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chin-Pei; Lin, Meng-Han; Chan, Ya-Ting; Chen, Li-Chyong; Ma, Che; Fischer, Wolfgang B.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09242b23825a9c7e09660df99494b673e5abea3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4926278.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4926278/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["type Vpu","phosphorylation sites of Vpu","mutant Vpu","time Vpu","full-length Vpu","cytoplasmic domain of Vpu","smallest assembly unit of Vpu","degree of phosphorylation","HIV","lipid membrane","different degrees of phosphorylation","rate of oligomerization","human immunodeficiency virus type","downregulation of host factors","models of wild","human cells","short integral membrane protein","known role","hydrated lipid bilayer","Viral protein U","Size exclusion chromatography of wild","dimer","mutants","Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations","group","associate","experimental data","double mutations","clone NL4","higher oligomers","addition","study","oligomeric state","infectivity cycle","serines","ionic strength"],"language":"en"},

CMV has long been appreciated as a pathogen in immunocompromised hosts. CMV reactivates in approximately one-third of latently infected non-immune-suppressed hosts during critical illness; however, its role as a pathogen in these patients remains unclear. CMV reactivation has been linked to bacterial sepsis and likely results from inflammation, transient immune compromise, and viral epigenetic changes. While CMV may improve immune response to some bacterial infections, other data suggest that CMV induces exaggerated responses to severe infections that may be harmful to latently infected hosts. These results also suggest that previous infection history may explain significant differences seen between human septic responses and murine models of sepsis. While critically ill human hosts clearly have worse outcomes associated with CMV reactivation, determining causality remains an area of investigation, with randomized control trials currently being performed. Here we review the current literature and highlight areas for future investigation.","publish_time":"2015-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mansfield, Sara; Grie\u00DFl, Marion; Gutknecht, Michael; Cook, Charles H.","journal":"Med Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4928686.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4928686/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMV reactivation","infected hosts","infected non-immune-suppressed hosts","ill human hosts","immune response","immunocompromised hosts","transient immune compromise","bacterial infections","bacterial sepsis","ill patients","area of investigation","pathogen","human septic responses","exaggerated responses","likely results","severe infections","future investigation","area of increasing","murine models of sepsis","significant differences","inflammation","worse outcomes","critical illness","previous infection history","data","viral epigenetic changes","areas","role","causality","randomized control trials","current literature","Cytomegalovirus"],"language":"en"},

Soil samples were collected from each quadrat and analysed for pH, loss\u2010on\u2010ignition, heavy metal and nutrient elements in the soil solution and for several physical properties. The mine spoil was physically and chemically heterogenous with many of the soil solution samples having potentially toxic concentrations of copper, lead and zinc. The vegetation data were ordinated: axis 1 of the ordination was significantly correlated (positively) with all three heavy metal concentrations, silt and sand, and (negatively) with loss\u2010on\u2010ignition and potassium concentration; axis 2 was significantly negatively correlated with pH and calcium, nitrate and phosphate concentrations. Consideration of this ordination and comparisons between soil parameters associated with each of the three vegetation groups and with non\u2010vegetated quadrats, suggest that lead and zinc may be the major determining factors of the spoil\u2010heap vegetation. Low nutrients (except phosphate) and in some cases adverse soil physical factors might be important also. The apparently small influence of copper is discussed. Above\u2010ground parts of five plant species were collected from the mine spoil and were shown often to have high heavy metal concentrations which differed between species.

The goal of the human MHC project is to predict the binding strength of any given peptide/MHC complex. This prediction allows the design of peptide\u2010based vaccines. The prediction requires representative binding data from MHC alleles from all the nine HLA supertypes. Here, we describe the genetic construction, protein production and purification as well as the establishment\u2010binding assays for two recombinant MHC supertype alleles, HLA\u2010B*1501 and HLA\u2010B*5801. Methods: Using the Quikchange Multisite Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), codon\u2010optimized genes encoding HLA\u2010B*1501 and HLA\u2010B*5801 are created. The two MHC I molecules are fermented and purified by ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The binding (KD) of natural T\u2010cell epitopes, as well as predicted peptide ligands, is described by radioactive immunoassays (RIAs) and enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The MHC molecules are biotinylated during expression. Results: The expression of MHC I resulted in multiple disulfide bond isomers, which are separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and used in subsequent binding studies resulting in the determination of KD for various peptide ligands ranging from strong binders (KD \u003C 50 nM) to low binders (KD \u003E 5 \u00B5M). Tetramerization is visualized by SDS\u2010PAGE. Conclusion: An effective method for the production of highly pure MHC I molecules has been applied to HLA\u2010B*1501 and HLA\u2010B*5801, and RIA and ELISA binding assays for those alleles have been established, showing the binding of various peptide ligands to the MHC I molecules.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"R\u00F8der, G.; Lamberth, K.; Buus, S.","journal":"Scand J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68af8c4baa53dda749085799a56f50487b8d1328.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","HLA","KD","RIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHC molecules","MHC alleles","MHC complex","expression of MHC","pure MHC","binding of various peptide ligands","binding strength","human MHC project","ELISA binding assays","HLA supertypes","recombinant MHC supertype alleles","subsequent binding studies","representative binding data","predicted peptide ligands","given peptide","design of peptide","hydrophobic interaction chromatography","determination of KD","size exclusion chromatography","ion exchange chromatography","protein production","prediction","linked immunosorbent assays","strong binders","cell epitopes","low binders","natural T","protein content","T cells","Major histocompatibility complex class","Stratagene","enzyme","Quikchange Multisite Directed Mutagenesis Kit","codon","nM","RIAs","purification","optimized genes","cytotoxic CD8","radioactive immunoassays","small derived peptides","multiple disulfide bond isomers","Rationale","ELISAs","genetic construction","establishment","effective method","Methods","based vaccines","goal","\u00B5M","Tetramerization","SDS","PAGE","Conclusion","Results"],"language":"en"},

We investigated antitumour immune responses in sentinel nodes from patients with bladder cancer, by assaying tumour\u2010specific proliferation and TCR V\u03B2 repertoires. During tumour surgery, sentinel lymph nodes were identified by peri\u2010tumoural injection of blue dye. Fresh specimens of tumour, sentinel and nonsentinel lymph nodes were obtained, and single\u2010cell suspensions were prepared. Cells were assayed for reactivity against autologous tumour extract in [(3)H]\u2010thymidine incorporation assays and characterized by flow cytometry. Parallel analyses of the expression of V\u03B2 gene families were performed with padlock probes, linear oligonucleotides which upon target recognition can be converted to circular molecules by a ligase. Probes were reacted with cDNA prepared from magnetically separated CD4(\u002B) cells, and the TCR repertoire was determined by hybridizing the products to oligonucleotide microarrays. Dose\u2010dependent proliferation in response to tumour extract could be detected in sentinel lymph nodes. Common clonal expansions were detected among tumour\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes and in sentinel lymph nodes. Nonsentinel lymph nodes displayed a divergent TCR V\u03B2 repertoire.

In order to study the histological picture of these proliferation phases, we used a mouse model of contact sensitivity in the oral mucosa and on skin. We also used bromodeoxyuridin (BrdU, an analogue to thymidin) that is incorporated into the nucleus during cell replication. The hapten oxazolone (OXA) was used to sensitize and elicit the oral mucosa and/or the ear skin. Mice were killed at various times after elicitation, and unsensitized animals were also exposed to the hapten as controls. BrdU (25 mg/kg animal) was injected i.p. 2 h before the kill. Specimens from the oral mucosa, ear skin and submandibular and auricular lymph nodes were cut and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. They were then treated with acid and biotinylated anti\u2010BrdU antibody and developed using ABC\u2010kit and DAB. The analyses were performed using a Leica light microscope and the computer program analysis. In the oral mucosa, the frequency of proliferating cells were increasing during the observation period, 4\u201324 h after elicitation, regardless of site of sensitization. The proliferating cells were found mainly in the basal cell layer of the epithelium. Similar patterns were found in ear skin. The regional lymph nodes demonstrated a few scattered proliferating cells 4 h after elicitation. After 24 h, these cells were found frequently in the whole lymph node. Control animals exhibited considerable less proliferating cells at all times. We conclude that most proliferating cells were found 24 h after elicitation locally at the hapten\u2010exposed sites (the oral mucosa or the ear skin) as well as in the regional lymph nodes.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahlfors, E.; Sveinhaug, M.

Its primary function in stimulation of IFN\u2010\u03B3 production and stimulation of NK\u2010cell\u2010cytotoxic activities makes this cytokine a candidate for cancer immunotherapy. In oral cavity, this cytokine is produced by oral epithelia and carcinoma cells and is related to tumour regression in nude mice bearing salivary adenocarcinoma. However, direct effects of this cytokine on oral cancer cells have not been elucidated. In this project, we investigated IL\u201018 effect on an oral carcinoma (KB) cell line. With RT\u2010PCR technique, KB\u2010cell line was found to express IL\u201018 receptors (IL\u201018R\u03B1 and IL\u201018R\u03B2), indicating that this oral carcinoma line is a target for IL\u201018 study. We showed that recombinant human IL\u201018 inhibited KB\u2010cell proliferation by 17% at concentration of 100 ng/ml (P \u003C 0.05), whereas LDH release by these cells in treatment group and control groups was comparable, indicating that IL\u201018 suppression of cell proliferation was not mediated by the induction of cell death. To further address this hypothesis, we found that IL\u201018 treatment did not induce apoptotic cell death, as studied by DNA laddering and TUNEL assays. In addition, expression pattern of cell death\u2010controlling genes (bcl\u20102 and bax) was not altered by this cytokine. Findings in these studies indicated that suppression of KB\u2010cell proliferation may be attributed to control of cell cycle, growth arrest or induction of cell differentiation. The data presented in this project could provide an insight of how cancer cell directly responds to IL\u201018, as this cytokine is an important regulator of anticancer mechanisms.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nilkaeo, A.; Bhuvanath, S.","journal":"Scand J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7b329dd508e8d6e9a0e257ca34e9d932be7a4ae.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169582/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjszNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDH","TUNEL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell line","cell cycle","induction of cell death","suppression of cell proliferation","express IL","apoptotic cell death","induction of cell differentiation","expression pattern of cell death","oral cancer cells","recombinant human IL","oral carcinoma line","carcinoma cells","oral epithelia","oral cavity","pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine","nonlymphoid cells","cancer immunotherapy","project","stimulation of IFN","stimulation of NK","treatment group","control groups","tumour regression","\u03B3 production","growth arrest","critical role","cytotoxic activities","modulation of innate","nude mice","candidate","genes","target","salivary adenocarcinoma","DNA laddering","LDH release","PCR technique","bcl","addition","R\u03B1","receptors","important regulator of anticancer mechanisms","adaptive immunity","primary function","direct effects","TUNEL assays","concentration","R\u03B2","insight","bax","Findings","studies","study","data","Interleukin","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Immunological responses to malignant transformation of epithelial cells gained increasing interest recently. A former study could demonstrate binding of MBL to certain colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cell lines in vitro. We therefore examined the expression of human collectins in normal colon mucosa and in colorectal carcinomas. Materials and methods: Colon samples from 20 CRC patients and 10 normal mucosa samples were collected immediately after surgery. The tissue was microdissected and RNA isolated (Qiagen, Rneasy\u2010Kit). Gene expression profiles were analysed using Gene\u2010chips (Affymetrix, HG\u2010U133). We analysed the data for the expression of MBL, its associated serine proteases mannan\u2010binding lectin\u2010associated serine protease 1/2 (MASP 1/2), SP\u2010A and SP\u2010D. The signal intensity of the genes of interest was compared using the Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010test. Results: The expression of human collectins in normal human colon mucosa was generally low. Only the expression of SP\u2010A and MASP\u20102 reached the noise threshold of 250 signals. These genes were significantly downregulated in CRC specimens. The expression of the other proteins showed no difference in normal mucosa and CRC. Conclusion: As demonstrated before, the expression of human collectins in normal colon was low in this study. Only SP\u2010A showed a significant expression in normal mucosa which was downregulated in CRC. As the absolute signal level was below the noise threshold, these results have to be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by direct measurenment of the proteins. Our results suggest that there is no major role for the human collectins in colorectal cancer.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siassi, M.; Hohenberger, W.; Croner, R.","journal":"Scand J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/744525750a082426661f8e6fe50ff464030daac4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169588/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjszNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBL","CRC","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of SP","expression of human collectins","expression of MBL","normal human colon mucosa","normal colon mucosa","significant expression","normal mucosa samples","Gene expression profiles","binding of MBL","Colon samples","CRC patients","CRC specimens","Results","binding lectin","colorectal carcinomas","colorectal cancer","surfactant protein","MASP","noise threshold","proteins","study","genes","associated serine proteases mannan","certain colorectal carcinoma","central role","major role","signal intensity","absolute signal level","malignant transformation of epithelial cells","chips","RNA isolated","Immunological responses","cell lines","Qiagen","Rneasy","confirmation","direct measurenment","Affymetrix","HG","innate immune system","caution","methods","difference","Whitney U","test","Kit","U133","Materials","Introduction","tissue","signals","surgery","data","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Interspecific variations in the photosynthetic rate were driven mainly by variability in the specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content. The taller weeds and the crop had a low specific leaf area later in the season, whereas the smaller weeds had a relatively high specific leaf area, which might be an adaptation to the shaded environment below the canopy.

There were five symposia ranging from sequence alignment to worm biology to biogeography. As with Hennig 21 at Helsinki, there was strong student participation. Student posters represented 13 of the total 16 posters and 23 of 65 oral presentations were by students. Student presentations were part of all symposia. The strength and future of the Willi Hennig Society resides in the students and recent meetings indicate a healthy society for the future. The Student Awards Committee consisted of Jonathan A.

Recent studies suggested that BCG, the only licensed vaccine against M. tuberculosis, may fail to induce T\u2010cell responses in the lung mucosa and may therefore not protect against pulmonary TB. A decrease in TB mortality may be achieved by enhancing immunity in the lung. The present study evaluated the induction of antigen\u2010specific immunity in the lung by intranasal (i.n.) delivery of the lipoprotein I (OprI) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. OprI has shown to be a Toll\u2010like receptor 2/4 agonist that, when given subcutaneously, induces Type\u20101 immune responses against heterologous antigens. Here, a fusion of OprI to Ag85A of Mtb (OprI\u2010Ag85A) was used as a subunit vaccine in homologous prime\u2010boost immunizations. In addition, OprI\u2010Ag85A was combined with an Ag85A\u2010encoding DNA vaccine (Ag85A DNA) or with BCG in heterologous prime\u2010boost vaccinations. Intranasal and parenteral delivery with OprI\u2010Ag85A elicited comparable T\u2010cell responses in the spleen; in addition, i.n. delivery elicited specific T\u2010cell responses in the lung lymph nodes (LLNs). Intramuscular delivery of Ag85A DNA induced significant systemic Th1 immune responses. Intranasal boosting with OprI\u2010Ag85A enhanced this response and in addition induced an antigen\u2010specific IFN\u2010\u03B3 response in LLN.

Approach \u2013 The chapter begins with a rhetorical analysis of one particularly influential account of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Therein, we learn that the race to discover the outbreak\u0027s aetiology was tainted by scientific malpractice; that an esteemed Chinese microbiologist, Dr. Hong, apparently promoted his own, patently false, aetiological discovery, stifled debate on the matter and, in doing so, held the international response to the outbreak back by a number of weeks. But how was this account rhetorically constructed? And how did it engage with Dr. Hong\u0027s own research work? Findings \u2013 Does Hong deserve to be remembered as an inept scientist? Subsequent accounts have been quick to repeat this one, founding text\u0027s account, suggesting that \u2018yes, he does\u2019. This chapter, however, returns to the primary data, examines the ways in which the original account troped those data and moves to suggest that \u2018no, he does not\u2019.

We examine the stock price behavior of Chinese listed firms around two visible political events\u2014meetings of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and promotions of high\u2010level provincial politicians\u2014that are expected to asymmetrically increase the costs of releasing bad news. The costs create an incentive for local politicians and their affiliated firms to temporarily restrict the flow of negative information about the companies. The result will be fewer stock price crashes for the affiliated firms during these event windows, followed by an increase in crashes after the event. Consistent with these predictions, we find that the affiliated firms experience a reduction (an increase) in negative stock return skewness before (after) the event.

Untreated inflammatory processes of the trachea may present in the form of acute airway obstruction, potentially resulting in significant morbidity and even mortality. Therefore it is important to recognize the cardinal features of some of the common tracheal infectious processes to differentiate them from non-infectious pathology, as the latter is associated with a more indolent course. As with most other infectious processes of the airway, pathogens causing tracheal infection can be bacterial, viral or fungal in nature. Viral etiology represents the most common cause of laryngotracheal infection in a child. Bacterial infections of the trachea are responsible for more significant morbidity, including prolonged hospitalization, need for endotracheal intubation and even an occasional tracheostomy.

METHODS: This was a cross\u2010sectional study. Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory syndrome in a tertiary care hospital from 2012 to 2013 were reviewed. RESULTS: HRV was the most common CRV observed (36%, 162/444) and was present in the majority of viral co\u2010detections (69%, 88/128), mainly in association with human enterovirus (45%). Most HRV\u2010infected patients were younger than 2 years (57%). Overall, patients infected with HRV had a lower frequency of severe acute respiratory infection than those infected with other CRVs (60% and 84%, respectively, p = 0.006), but had more comorbidities (40% and 27%, respectively; p = 0.043). However, in the adjusted analysis this association was not significant. The mortality rate within the HRV group was 3%. Detection of HRV was more prevalent during autumn and winter, with a moderately negative correlation between viral infection frequency and temperature (r = \u22120.636, p \u003C 0.001) but no correlation with rainfall (r = \u22120.036, p = 0.866). CONCLUSION: HRV is usually detected in hospitalized children with respiratory infections and is often present in viral co\u2010detections. Comorbidities are closely associated with HRV infections. These infections show seasonal variation, with predominance during colder seasons.","publish_time":"2017-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leotte, Jaqueline; Trombetta, Hygor; Faggion, Heloisa Z.; Almeida, Bernardo M.; Nogueira, Meri B.; Vidal, Luine R.; Raboni, Sonia M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96eef7a59ab3eccec81d50e79dc67e8f0e64a0fc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153728/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRV","HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV infections","respiratory infections","HRV group","Detection of HRV","infected patients","respiratory virus","viral infection frequency","acute respiratory syndrome","lower frequency of severe acute respiratory infection","laboratory data of patients","majority of viral co\u2010detections","association","hospitalized children","comorbidities","clinical characteristics","epidemiological features","human enterovirus","common CRV","consecutive years","moderately negative correlation","outcomes of human rhinovirus","comparison","winter","predominance","community","temperature","tertiary care hospital","seasonal variation","autumn","colder seasons","adjusted analysis","mortality rate","METHODS","cross\u2010sectional study","OBJECTIVES","rainfall","RESULTS","CRVs","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The procedures used to isolate cells from gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are traumatic or include enzyme digestion. A technique should be selected that is efficient yet gentle enough to provide viable and functional cells. Moreover, the cells contaminating leukocyte preparations can affect the functional assays.

Concerns for the health of laboratory animals have mostly focused on spontaneous infections, although disease in laboratory animals may also be caused by genetic or environmental determinants. The presence of various pathogenic microorganisms may cause changes in the organs, resulting in difficulties in the interpretation of the pathological diagnosis included in the evaluation of many microbiological models. The immune system may be modulated by spontaneous infections in the absence of clinical disease. This effect may be either suppressive or activating or both at the same time, but on different parts of the immune system. Some microorganisms have a specific effect on enzymatic, haematological, and other parameters, which are monitored in the animal during an experiment. Organic function disturbances may change the outcome of the experiment without the knowledge of the scientist. Spontaneous infections in an experimental infection model may also compete with the experimental infection, which in the worst cases may fail. Microorganisms present in the animal may contaminate samples and tissue specimens, such as cells and sera. This may complicate the in vitro maintenance of cell lines, and may interfere with experiments performed on cell cultures or isolated organs. To avoid disease, microbial interference, and zoonoses, laboratory animals are produced according to a three-step principle, which include rederivation, barrier protection, and health monitoring. Rederivation means the production of animals to initiate breeding colonies by either caesarian section or embryo transfer.","publish_time":"2007-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hansen, A.K.","journal":"Handbook of Animal Models of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89d546ba77ba31b467a637ddcc3e804512551383.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health of laboratory animals","spontaneous infections","production of animals","experimental models","experimental infection model","poor health","rederivation","health monitoring","Microorganisms present","immune system","absence of clinical disease","presence of various pathogenic microorganisms","cell cultures","isolated organs","specific effect","microbiological models","maintenance of cell lines","breeding colonies","caesarian section","outcome","zoonoses","tissue specimens","barrier protection","microbial interference","evaluation","experiments","samples","different parts","changes","pathological diagnosis","embryo transfer","interpretation","Organic function disturbances","cells","knowledge","difficulties","antimicrobial research","Concerns","step principle","worst cases","environmental determinants","sera","time","parameters","scientist","chapter"],"language":"en"},

On the other hand, chronic diseases will dominate because they occur due to the relevant gene\u0027s maladjustment to the modern living environment. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the incompatibilities between the genes and the living environments and, more importantly, to the impact of changes in the living environment. However, specific chronic disease is not caused by a specific environmental factor but occurs when the systems of the human body are affected by exposure to specific environmental factors and work beyond their normal ranges. Therefore, the concept of treating a patient with a chronic disease by simply eliminating the cause of the disease has some fundamental limitations. Now, the medical practice must be changed from disease-centered medicine to patient- or human-centered medicine.","publish_time":"2019-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hong, Yun-Chul","journal":"The Changing Era of Diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150344/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific chronic disease","disease-centered medicine","Infectious disease epidemics","patient","specific environmental factors","modern living environment","human-centered medicine","living environments","chronic diseases","human body","work","exposure","relevant gene\u0027s maladjustment","development of vaccines","public health","genes","systems","cause","normal ranges","improvement","incompatibilities","history","impact of changes","fundamental limitations","attention","antibiotics","hand","medical practice","concept"],"language":"en"},

Major depression in type 2 diabetes is associated with decreased adherence to self-care behaviors. The association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviors, however, has not previously been systematically reviewed. The objective of this review is to determine the association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviors. METHODS A systematic search was performed in five electronic databases that included MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Emcare, and CINAHL. Any observational studies in adults with type 2 diabetes, investigating the association between subthreshold depression and any self-care behaviors, were included in the review. Qualitative studies, review articles, and gray literature were excluded. Two reviewers independently completed the title and abstract and full-text screening, appraised the study quality, and extracted the data. A third reviewer resolved any discrepancies between the reviewers if needed. Included articles were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist. Meta-analyses were not conducted because criteria for conducting such analyses were not met. RESULTS A total of 6408 articles were identified through the database searching. After the abstract and full-text review, two articles met the inclusion criteria. One of the included study was cross-sectional while the other was a longitudinal study. Both studies showed inconsistent findings in the association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviors. Important risks of bias were identified in the included studies. DISCUSSION The evidence from the two included studies on a possible association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviors in adults with type 2 diabetes was not consistent and potentially biased. Our review established a gap in knowledge and suggests that further high-quality studies are needed to examine the association between subthreshold depression and self-care behaviors in people with type 2 diabetes.

It has peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity and is a receptor for cyclosporin A (CsA). Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Seven types of coronaviruses are currently known to infect humans, among which SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are fatal for humans. It is well established that CypA is essential for the replication of various coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, and FCoV. Additionally, CsA and its derivatives (ALV, NIM811, etc.) have obvious inhibitory effects on a variety of coronaviruses. These results suggest that CypA is a potential antiviral target and the existing drug CsA might be used as an anti-coronavirus drug. At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 raged in China, which seriously theatern human health and causes huge economic lases. In view of this, we describe the effects of CypA on the replication of coronaviruses and the antiviral activities of its inhibitors, which will provide the scientific basis and ideas for the development of antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Lu; Liu, Wenjun; Sun, Lei","journal":"Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.13345/j.cjb.200049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347055/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CsA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","CoV-NL63","replication of coronaviruses","variety of coronaviruses","effects of CypA","types of coronaviruses","replication of various coronaviruses","antiviral activities","existing drug CsA","humans","potential antiviral target","development of antiviral drugs","obvious inhibitory effects","anti-coronavirus drug","trans isomerase activity","theatern human health","receptor","ideas","peptidyl-prolyl cis","NIM811","China","positive-sense RNA viruses","scientific basis","derivatives","ALV","cyclosporin","inhibitors","conserved protein","organisms","results","FCoV","end","Cyclophilin","view"],"language":"en"},

However, this scenario is more complex than initially thought due to the heterogeneity of hyperinflammation. Some patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) develop a fully blown secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), whereas others, despite a consistent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, do not fulfil sHLH criteria but still show some features resembling the phenotype of the hyperferritinemic syndrome. Despite the final event (the cytokine storm) is shared by various conditions leading to sHLH, the aetiology, either infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic, accounts for the differences in the various phases of this process. Moreover, the evidence of a hyperinflammatory microenvironment provided the rationale to employ immunomodulating agents for therapeutic purposes in severe COVID-19. This viewpoint aims at discussing the pitfalls and issues to be considered with regard to the use of immunomodulating agents in COVID-19, such as timing of treatment based on the viral load and the extent of cytokine/ferritin overexpression. Furthermore, it encompasses recent findings in the paediatric field about a novel multisystem inflammatory disease resembling toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease observed in children with proven SARS-CoV2 infection.

It is characterized by the infiltra tion of eosinophils in the pulmonary and alveolar interstitium, and may be primary or secondary as well as present an acute or chronic progress. OBJECTIVE to present 2 pediatric EP clinical cases which were diagnosed at the pediatric intensive care unit of Clinica Indisa in Santiago, Chile between 2014 and 2017. CLINICAL CASES Two older infants, who were hospitalized due to respiratory failure with a diagnosis of viral pneumonia. Both have asthmatic mothers. Additionally, they both had febrile syn drome, persistent condensation images in the chest x-rays, and peripheral eosinophilia throughout the course of the disease. One of the infants required oxygen for more than one month, and there was no eosinophilia in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In this case, the diagnosis of EP was reached via pulmonary biopsy. The other infant required mechanic ventilation for 28 days, and was diagnosed due to eosinophilia greater than 25% in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Both patients had excellent res ponse to systemic corticosteroids. CONCLUSION After ruling out other causes, EP should be suspected in children with pneumonia diagnosis, and persistent symptoms that do not respond positively to treatment, especially if associated with peripheral eosinophilia. The diagnosis of EP in pediatrics is confirmed with eosinophilia greater than 20% in BAL and, in some cases, it is necessary to perform a lung biopsy.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linares P, Marcela; Monreal E, Victor; Gomez P, Paola; Mart\u00EDnez B, Pamela; Bozzo H, Rodrigo","journal":"Revista chilena de pediatria","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.32641/rchped.v90i6.1057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32186589/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eosinophilic Pneumonia"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Chile"],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of EP","pneumonia diagnosis","peripheral eosinophilia","eosinophilia greater","pediatric EP clinical cases","diagnosis of viral pneumonia","pulmonary biopsy","Pediatrics","BAL","bronchoalveolar lavage","INTRODUCTION Eosinophilic Pneumonia","persistent symptoms","older infants","lung biopsy","persistent condensation images","pediatric intensive care unit of Clinica Indisa","chest x-rays","excellent res ponse","Santiago","febrile syn drome","systemic corticosteroids","patients","alveolar interstitium","OBJECTIVE","children","infiltra tion of eosinophils","respiratory failure","mechanic ventilation","days","Chile","course","rare disorder","chronic progress","oxygen","causes","month","disease","asthmatic mothers","CONCLUSION","treatment"],"language":"en"},

Methods: From January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020, a total of 33 patients with 2019-nCoV infection diagnosed and treated by Suzhou Fifth People\u0027s Hospital were analyzed retrospectively, including 20 males and 13 females, with an average age of (50\u00B112) years, ranging from 20 to 70 years old. There were 3 cases of mild type, 27 cases of common type and 3 cases of severe type.There were 2 cases with hypertension, 1 case with postoperative lung,1 case with diabetes, 1 case with chronic bronchitis, and 1 case with bronchiectasis.SPSS25.0 Chi-square test was used to analyze the distribution of lesions in each lung lobe; SPSS25.0 Spearman correlation coefficient was used to analyze the image score and clinical classification. Results: There were 3 cases (9.1%) with normal lung and 30 cases (90.9%) with Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia(COVID-19) of the 2019-nCoV infected patients. In the distribution of COVID-19, 29 cases (87.9%) were involved in bilateral lung and 1 case (3.0%) in unilateral lung. There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of lesions in each lobe. The correlation coefficient between the degree of lesion distribution and clinical classification was 0.819, and the two were highly correlated.There were 30 cases (90.9%) with subpleural lesions, 17 cases (51.5%) with central lesions. There were many kinds of lesions, 25 cases (75.8%) had ground glass density shadow, 16 cases (48.5%) had consolidation, 12 cases (36.4%) had interstitial change, and 18 cases (54.5%) had interlobular septal thickening. Among the 22 cases, 10 cases had more lesions, 6 cases had no changes and 6 cases had less lesions. Conclusion: Most of the patients with 2019-nCoV infection have pulmonary inflammation.CT manifestations include multiple parts, subpleural area or middle and lateral field of lung, ground glass shadow and consolidation, or coexistence. Some cases have pleural thickening or interlobular septal thickening. CT images can indicate the diagnosis of COVID-19 and provide important basis for early detection and disease monitoring.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, R R; Zhu, Y; Wu, M Y; Liu, J; Ren, R; Cao, Q L; Shen, X H; Chen, G Q; Li, M","journal":"Zhonghua yi xue za zhi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200203-00182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294858/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","Suzhou Fifth People\u0027s Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of common type","cases of severe type","cases of mild type","distribution of lesions","subpleural lesions","lung lobe","central lesions","kinds of lesions","postoperative lung","nCoV infection","normal lung","bilateral lung","unilateral lung","distribution of COVID","diagnosis of COVID","lateral field of lung","nCoV infected patients","early diagnosis","CT imaging features","ability of imaging diagnosis","interlobular septal thickening","CT manifestations","ground glass shadow","SPSS25","degree of lesion distribution","CT images","imaging characteristics","disease monitoring","pleural thickening","clinical classification","consolidation","ground glass density shadow","Spearman correlation coefficient","Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia","subpleural area","early detection","years old","multiple parts","pulmonary inflammation","diabetes","important basis","bronchiectasis","chronic bronchitis","Suzhou","order","hypertension","changes","Chi-square test","image score","females","coexistence","significant difference","interstitial change","average age","People\u0027s Hospital","Objective","total","Conclusion","Results","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is only curative treatment for the disease. However, there are limited information about long-term outcome of HSCT and its effect to protect against cancer development in DOCK8 deficient patients. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated clinical, immunological characteristics of 20 DOCK8 deficient patients and outcome of 11 patients who underwent HSCT. We aimed to report the experience of our center and the resultas of the largest transplantation series of DOCK8 deficiency in our country. Median follow-up time is 71 months (min-max: 16-172) in all patients and 48 months (min-max:5-84) in transplanted patients. Atopic dermatitis (18/20), recurrent respiratory tract infections (17/20), food allergy (14/20) were the most frequent clinical manifestations. Failure to thrive (13/20), liver problems (12/20), bronchiectasis (11/20), chronic diarrhea (10/21), and autism spectrum disorders (3/20) were remarkable findings in our series. Elevated IgE level (20/20), eosinophilia (17/20), low IgM level (15/20) and CD3\u002B T (10/20), and CD4\u002B T (11/20) lymphopenia were prominent laboratory findings. HSCT performed in 11 patients. All patients achieved adequate engraftment and showed improvement in their clinical and immunologic findings. Atopic dermatitis and food allergies improved in all patients and their dietary restriction was stopped except one patient who was transplanted recently. The frequency of infections decreased. The overall survival is 91% in HSCT received patients, 80% in all.

Growing anecdotal evidence suggests increasing incidence of cases of anosmia during the current pandemic, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause olfactory dysfunction.

SETTING Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell RESULTS: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 days; 64% respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last week. Of the cohort, 17% did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation. CONCLUSIONS Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom.

There is no vaccine for MERS and anti-viral treatment is generally not applicable. We investigated the evolution of the MERS-CoV spike gene sequences and changes in viral loads over time from patients in Saudi Arabia from 2105-2017. All the MERS-CoV strains belonged to lineage 5, and showed high sequence homology (99.9%) to 2017 strains. Recombination analysis showed a potential recombination event in study strains from patients in Saudi Arabia. The spike gene showed eight amino acid substitutions, especially between the A1 and B5 lineage, and contained positively selected codon 1020. We also determined that the viral loads were significantly (p \u003C 0.001) higher in fatal cases, and virus shedding was prolonged in some fatal cases beyond 21 days. The viral concentration peaked during the first week of illness, and the lower respiratory specimens had higher levels of MERS-CoV RNA. The presence of the diversifying selection and the topologies with the structural mapping of residues under purifying selection suggested that codon 1020 might have a role in the evolution of spike gene during the divergence of different lineages. This study will im-prove our understanding of the evolution of MERS-CoV, and also highlights the need for enhanced surveillance in humans and dromedaries. The presence of amino acid changes at the N-terminal domain and structural mapping of residues under positive selection at heptad repeat 1 provides better insight into the adaptive evolution of the spike gene and might have a potential role in virus-host tropism and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naeem, Asif; Hamed, Maaweya E; Alghoribi, Majed F; Aljabr, Waleed; Alsaran, Hadel; Enani, Mushira A; Alosaimi, Bandar","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370153/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["evolution of MERS","MERS-CoV strains","MERS-CoV spike gene sequences","evolution of spike gene","higher levels of MERS","CoV RNA","viral loads","adaptive evolution","study strains","viral concentration","structural mapping of residues","patients","potential role","positive selection","purifying selection","diversifying selection","presence of amino acid changes","anti-viral treatment","fatal cases","Saudi Arabia","potential recombination event","amino acid substitutions","Recombination analysis","virus shedding","B5 lineage","selected codon","lower respiratory specimens","virus-host tropism","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","N-terminal domain","time","heptad","lethal zoonotic pathogen","topologies","better insight","enhanced surveillance","humans","week of illness","need","divergence of different lineages","vaccine","understanding","Arabian Peninsula","dromedaries","pathogenesis","high sequence homology","days"],"language":"en"},

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the primary aim of estimating mortality from major causes of adult meningitis in routine care settings, and to contrast this with outcomes from clinical trial settings. METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for published clinical trials (defined as randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) or investigator-managed prospective cohorts) and observational studies that evaluated outcomes of adult meningitis in SSA from 1 January 1990 through 15 September 2019. We performed random effects modelling to estimate pooled mortality, both in clinical trial and routine care settings. Outcomes were stratified as short-term (in-hospital or two weeks), medium-term (up to 10 weeks) and long-term (up to six months). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Seventy-nine studies met inclusion criteria. In routine care settings, pooled short-term mortality from cryptococcal meningitis was 44% (95% confidence interval (95% CI):39% to 49%, 40 studies), which did not differ between amphotericin (either alone or with fluconazole) and fluconazole-based induction regimens, and was twofold higher than pooled mortality in clinical trials using amphotericin based treatment (21% (95% CI:17% to 25%), 17 studies). Pooled short-term mortality of TB meningitis was 46% (95% CI: 33% to 59%, 11 studies, all routine care). For pneumococcal meningitis, pooled short-term mortality was 54% in routine care settings (95% CI:44% to 64%, nine studies), with similar mortality reported in two included randomized-controlled trials. Few studies evaluated long-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Mortality rates from HIV-associated meningitis in SSA are very high under routine care conditions. Better strategies are needed to reduce mortality from HIV-associated meningitis in the region.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tenforde, Mark W; Gertz, Alida M; Lawrence, David S; Wills, Nicola K; Guthrie, Brandon L; Farquhar, Carey; Jarvis, Joseph N","journal":"Journal of the International AIDS Society","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31957332/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pooled mortality","Pooled short-term mortality of TB meningitis","routine care settings","cryptococcal meningitis","pneumococcal meningitis","outcomes of adult meningitis","similar mortality","HIV-associated meningitis","routine care conditions","clinical trials","observational studies","major causes of adult meningitis","leading causes of adult meningitis","CONCLUSIONS Mortality rates","clinical trial settings","primary aim of estimating mortality","SSA","long-term outcomes","INTRODUCTION HIV-associated cryptococcal","included randomized-controlled trials","amphotericin","weeks","fluconazole-based induction regimens","RCTs","investigator-managed prospective cohorts","meta-analysis","sub-Saharan Africa","Cochrane Library","PubMed","EMBASE","DISCUSSION","systematic review","inclusion criteria","RESULTS","hospital","treatment","random effects","region","METHODS","confidence interval","Better strategies","months"],"language":"en"},

Both infections are associated with a variety of clinical signs and can impact quality of life and longevity. SCOPE This document is an update of the 2008 American Association of Feline Practitioners\u0027 feline retrovirus management guidelines and represents current knowledge on pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of retrovirus infections in cats. TESTING AND INTERPRETATION Although vaccines are available for FeLV in many countries and for FIV in some countries, identification of infected cats remains an important factor for preventing new infections. The retrovirus status of every cat at risk of infection should be known. Cats should be tested as soon as possible after they are acquired, following exposure to an infected cat or a cat of unknown infection status, prior to vaccination against FeLV or FIV, and whenever clinical illness occurs. It might not be possible to determine a cat\u0027s infection status based on testing at a single point in time; repeat testing using different methods could be required. Although FeLV and FIV infections can be associated with clinical disease, some infected cats, especially those infected with FIV, can live for many years with good quality of life. MANAGEMENT OF INFECTED CATS There is a paucity of data evaluating treatments for infected cats, especially antiretroviral and immunomodulatory drugs. Management of infected cats is focused on effective preventive healthcare strategies, and prompt identification and treatment of illness, as well as limiting the spread of infection.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Little, Susan; Levy, Julie; Hartmann, Katrin; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Hosie, Margaret; Olah, Glenn; Denis, Kelly St","journal":"Journal of feline medicine and surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x19895940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31916872/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MANAGEMENT OF INFECTED CATS","identification of infected cats","FIV infections","FeLV","treatment of retrovirus infections","retrovirus status","TESTING","clinical illness","new infections","cat of unknown infection status","cat\u0027s infection status","clinical disease","risk of infection","spread of infection","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Feline leukemia virus","feline immunodeficiency virus","American Association of Feline Practitioners\u0027 feline retrovirus management guidelines","countries","variety of clinical signs","treatment of illness","good quality of life","prompt identification","current knowledge","effective preventive healthcare strategies","pathogenesis","diagnosis","time","prevention","important factor","treatments","vaccination","paucity of data","single point","INTERPRETATION","vaccines","years","immunomodulatory drugs","update","different methods","longevity","exposure","document"],"language":"en"},

It has been used in a variety of procedures such as in general surgery and gynecology procedures including diagnostic laparoscopy. There has been increasing evidence of the utility of gasless laparoscopy in resource limited settings where diagnostic imaging is not available. In addition, it may help save costs for hospitals. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the available evidence surrounding the safety and efficiency of gasless laparoscopy compared to conventional laparoscopy and open techniques and to analyze the benefits that gasless laparoscopy has for low resource setting hospitals. METHODS This protocol is developed by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis-Protocols (PRISMA-P). The PRISMA statement guidelines and flowchart will be used to conduct the study itself. MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Global Index Medicus (WHO) will be searched and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. The articles that will be found will be pooled into Covidence article manager software where all the records will be screened for eligibility and duplicates removed. A data extraction spreadsheet will be developed based on variables of interest set a priori. Reviewers will then screen all included studies based on the eligibility criteria. The GRADE tool will be used to assess the quality of the studies and the risk of bias in all the studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk assessment tool. The RoB II tool will assed the risk of bias in randomized control studies and the ROBINS I will be used for the non-randomized studies. DISCUSSION This study will be a comprehensive review on all published articles found using this search strategy on the safety and efficiency of the use of gasless laparoscopy. The systematic review outcomes will include safety and efficiency of gasless laparoscopy compared to the use of conventional laparoscopy or laparotomy.

We aim to build a stable system with highly reproducible radiomics features, which can make diagnostic performance independent of datasets bias and segmentation methods. METHOD We applied a dataset of 267 patients including 136 malignant and 131 benign tumors from two MRI manufacturers, where 211 cases from a Philips system and 55 cases from a GE system. First, manual annotations, 3D-Unet and 2D-Unet were applied as different segmentation methods. Second, we designed and extracted 3172 features from six modalities of DCE-MRI based on BI-RADS. Third, the feature selection was conducted. Between-class distance was utilized to eliminate the effect of dataset bias caused by two machines. Concordance correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient and deviation were employed to evaluate the influence of three segmentation methods. We further eliminated features redundancy using genetic algorithm. Finally, three classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), the bagged trees and K-Nearest Neighbor were evaluated by their performance for diagnosing malignant and benign tumors. RESULTS A total of 246 features were preserved to have high stability and reproducibility. The final feature set showed the robust performance under these factors and achieved the area under curve of 0.88, the accuracy of 0.824, the sensitivity of 0.844, the specificity of 0.807 in differentiating benign and malignant tumors with the SVM classifier using manually segmentation results. CONCLUSION The final selected 246 features are reproducible and show little dependence on segmentation methods and data perturbation. The high stability and effectiveness of diagnosis across these factors illustrate that the preserved features can be used for prognostic analysis and help radiologists in the diagnosis of breast cancer.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiao, Mengyun; Li, Chengkang; Suo, Shiteng; Cheng, Fang; Hua, Jia; Xue, Dan; Guo, Yi; Xu, Jianrong; Wang, Yuanyuan","journal":"International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02177-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388693/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Philips","GE","SVM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preserved features","features redundancy","Data System","segmentation results","reproducible radiomics features","different segmentation methods","stable system","Philips system","GE system","benign tumors","malignant tumors","breast cancer diagnosis","diagnosis of breast cancer","robust performance","DCE-MRI","high stability","robust computer-aided system","D-Unet","BI-RADS","MRI manufacturers","effectiveness of diagnosis","factors","cases","quantitative high-throughput Breast Imaging Reporting","intraclass correlation coefficient","Concordance correlation coefficient","effect of dataset bias","final feature set","diagnostic performance independent of datasets bias","SVM classifier","data perturbation","modalities of DCE","feature selection","magnetic resonance imaging","dynamic contrast","little dependence","deviation","radiologists","success of radiomic applications","bagged trees","support vector machine","classifiers","Nearest Neighbor","prognostic analysis","curve","PURPOSE","manual annotations","genetic algorithm","CONCLUSION","influence","patients","sensitivity","accuracy","area","specificity","machines","reproducibility","class distance","total"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, here we aimed to evaluate the superiority of catheter-related outcomes after the application of tunneled cuffed catheter (TCC) without fluoroscopy versus unconditioned NTC insertion. Methods We divided the participants into two phases: those receiving NTCs between March 2010 and February 2011 (phase I), and those receiving TCCs or NTCs between March 2011 and February 2012 (phase II). Catheter survival, nurse satisfaction, and reasons for catheter removal were analyzed. Results Two hundred and sixty patients in phase I and 300 patients in phase II were enrolled in this study. The success rate of TCC insertion was 99.2%. The catheter survival rate in phase I was 65.5% at 1 month, while that in phase II was 74.9% at 1 month (p=0.023). We compared catheter survival between TCCs and NTCs for all periods regardless of phase. The TCC survival rate was higher than the NTC survival rate (p\u003C0.001).

AIMS We aimed to perform a uniform assessment of the global burden of IBS using data from Google Trends, a novel, online tool. METHODS Google Trends measures popularity of a search term in a given week compared to popularity of all search terms in that week, calculated as relative search volume (RSV). We compiled data on the popularity of IBS and its treatments across 173 countries between 2014 and 2018. We compared Google Trends popularity for IBS with prior epidemiological prevalence data, while controlling for gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and physician density. RESULTS Of the 173 countries with Google Trends data, 137 countries also had data for GDP per capita and physician density. Worldwide popularity of IBS as a search topic increased from 79 to 89 (13% increase by RSV) over the 5-year period between 2014 and 2018. Country-specific change in IBS RSV ranged from - 35% (Nigeria) to \u002B 64% (Pakistan). There was poor correlation between the Google Trends data and prior epidemiological data (0.08, Pearson correlation, p = 0.64). Popularity of the low-FODMAP diet increased the most among 8 common therapies (RSV 41 to 89, 117% increase). CONCLUSIONS Google Trends is a novel tool that can complement traditional epidemiological methods in gastrointestinal disease. Future research is needed to assess its utility and accuracy as a measure of disease burden across different gastrointestinal diseases.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flanagan, Ryan; Kuo, Braden; Staller, Kyle","journal":"Digestive diseases and sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06290-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361922/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["IBS","Google Trends","Google","IBS RSV"],"locations":["Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["Google Trends data","Google Trends popularity","IBS RSV","CONCLUSIONS Google Trends","Worldwide popularity of IBS","METHODS Google Trends measures popularity","prior epidemiological data","prior epidemiological prevalence data","global burden of IBS","countries","search terms","search topic","traditional epidemiological methods","novel tool","GDP","relative search volume","given week","physician density","increase","measure of disease burden","online tool","Pearson correlation","poor correlation","different gastrointestinal diseases","prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome","regions","gross domestic product","accuracy","Country-specific change","uniform assessment","low-FODMAP diet","utility","BACKGROUND","treatments","significant methodological heterogeneity","common therapies","RESULTS","Future research","year period","Nigeria","Pakistan"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Seventy-one patients [38 male, 33 female, mean age 47.2 years (range 18 to 81)] with surgery for an intracranial neuroepithelial tumor were included in this prospective single-center study. Mini-mental status examination (MMSE) and extensive neurocognitive testing (divided into the categories attention, memory, and executive functions and adjusted for age, sex, and education) were performed pre-(t0) and early postoperatively (t1). Part of the patient cohort (n = 32) also underwent neurocognitive testing during follow-up (t2). The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) was used to assess patients\u0027 functional independence. Patients\u0027 quality of life was recorded by the Short Form 36 (SF 36) pre- and postoperatively in a part of the patient cohort. Pre- and postoperative comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon-test for paired samples. Post hoc Bonferroni correction was performed to adjust for multiple testing. To assess the influence of risk factors on neurocognitive functions, Spearman correlations and the chi-squared test were performed. Subgroup analyses for patients with low-grade and high-grade tumors were performed. RESULTS Postoperative deterioration was observed in 5 of 39 subtests of extensive neurocognitive testing in all 3 categories, whereas no improvement was shown. Patients with WHO Grade I tumors showed no deterioration of cognitive functions. Patients with WHO Grade II and III tumors showed significantly worse results in the executive functions category patients with WHO Grade IV tumors showed deterioration in the attention category. Significantly worse functional independence was recorded postoperatively and during follow-up (P \u003C 0.001). Patients reported poorer physical health (SF 36, P = 0.001) at t1, whereas mental health did not differ significantly (P = 0.480). Risk factors for postoperative deterioration of cognition are low KPS scores, postoperative radiotherapy and tumor location in the temporal lobe. CONCLUSIONS After surgery on an intracranial neuroepithelial tumor, early postoperative deterioration of neurocognitive functions, functional independence and physical health occur. Similar results were also shown during follow-up suggesting that these effects are not only due to postoperative systemic factors or fatigue. This knowledge might improve perioperative surveillance of neurocognitive functions.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bette, Stefanie; Gradtke, Corinna V; Cammardella, Jasmin Hernandez; Albertshauser, Jennifer; Wiestler, Benedikt; Barz, Melanie; Meyer, Bernhard; Zimmer, Claus; Ryang, Yu-Mi; Ringel, Florian; Gempt, Jens","journal":"Journal of neuro-oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11060-020-03398-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31970595/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Karnofsky","Spearman"],"organizations":["Post hoc Bonferroni"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early postoperative deterioration of neurocognitive functions","perioperative neurocognitive functions","RESULTS Postoperative deterioration","executive functions category patients","deterioration of cognitive functions","perioperative surveillance of neurocognitive functions","postoperative deterioration of cognition","intracranial neuroepithelial tumors","postoperative radiotherapy","postoperative comparisons","subtests of extensive neurocognitive testing","postoperative systemic factors","surgery","high-grade tumors","follow-up","worse functional independence","patients\u0027 functional independence","mental health","worse results","multiple testing","tumor location","influence of risk factors","poorer physical health","categories attention","attention category","SF","Similar results","t1","patient cohort","mean age","Mini-mental status examination","Wilcoxon-test","low KPS scores","chi-squared test","Patients\u0027 quality of life","Karnofsky Performance Status Scale","prospective single-center study","MMSE","Spearman correlations","female","years","education","memory","temporal lobe","Short Form","Subgroup analyses","paired samples","range","t0","sex","knowledge","fatigue","CONCLUSIONS","t2","PURPOSE","METHODS","effects","Bonferroni correction","improvement"],"language":"en"},

Several studies have described typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue. However, to our knowledge, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurologic manifestations. Objective To study the neurologic manifestations of patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This is a retrospective, observational case series. Data were collected from January 16, 2020, to February 19, 2020, at 3 designated special care centers for COVID-19 (Main District, West Branch, and Tumor Center) of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. The study included 214 consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and data of all neurologic symptoms were checked by 2 trained neurologists. Neurologic manifestations fell into 3 categories: central nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury manifestations. Results Of 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7%]) with COVID-19, 126 patients (58.9%) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1%) had severe infection according to their respiratory status. Overall, 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations. Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough. Patients with more severe infection had neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]). Conclusions and Relevance Patients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic manifestations. During the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with neurologic manifestations, clinicians should suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat and prevent further transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Ling; Jin, Huijuan; Wang, Mengdie; Hu, Yu; Chen, Shengcai; He, Quanwei; Chang, Jiang; Hong, Candong; Zhou, Yifan; Wang, David; Miao, Xiaoping; Li, Yanan; Hu, Bo","journal":"JAMA neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.1127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32275288/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tumor Center","Relevance Patients"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["neurologic manifestations of patients","Relevance Patients","typical clinical manifestations","neurologic symptoms","consecutive hospitalized patients","nonsevere infection","peripheral nervous system manifestations","central nervous system manifestations","skeletal muscular injury manifestations","epidemic period of COVID","diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","fewer typical symptoms of COVID","vs","acute cerebrovascular diseases","taste impairment","vision impairment","smell impairment","differential diagnosis","delayed diagnosis","outbreak of coronavirus disease","Measures Clinical data","respiratory status","impaired consciousness","Wuhan","cough","fever","China","study","skeletal muscle injury","Main District","Main Outcomes","headache","dizziness","seizure","clinicians","Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science","nerve pain","ataxia","laboratory","categories","Tumor Center","electronic medical records","West Branch","hypertension","Technology","designated special care centers","Participants","retrospective","age","mean","misdiagnosis","diarrhea","underlying disorders","observational case series","chance","Importance","studies","Conclusions","trained neurologists","years","Setting","potential","fatigue","Results","Objective","transmission","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Patients who were planned to undergo lung resection surgery for lung tumors and needed OLV for at least 1 h were included in the study. After turning the patients into the lateral position under total intravenous anesthesia, OLV was commenced using a double-lumen endobronchial tube. EELV was measured using the nitrogen washout technique at 20 min after OLV started (baseline) and 15, 30, 45, 60 min after ARM was performed on the dependent lung. RESULTS Among 42 patients who completed the study, EELV increased at 15 min after ARM by 20% or greater compared with baseline in 21 patients (responders). Responders were significantly shorter in height (158 vs. 165 cm, p = 0.01) and had smaller preoperative functional residual capacity (2.99L vs. 3.65L, p = 0.02) than non-responders. Before ARM, responders had significantly higher driving pressure (14.2 vs. 12.4 cmH2O, p = 0.01) and lower respiratory system compliance (23.6 vs. 31.4 ml/cmH2O, p = 0.0002) than non-responders. Driving pressure temporarily dropped after ARM in responders, while no significant change was observed in non-responders.

Thus, in addition to phytochemists, nutritionists and consumers are now deeply interested in the phytochemical constituents of mushrooms, which provide beneficial effects to humans in terms of health promotion and reduction of disease-related risks. In recent years, scientific reports on the nutritional, phytochemical and pharmacological properties of mushroom have been overwhelming. However, the bioactive compounds and biological properties of wild edible mushrooms growing in Southeast Asian countries have been rarely described. In this review, the bioactive compounds isolated from 25 selected wild edible mushrooms growing in Southeast Asia have been reviewed, together with their biological activities. Phytoconstituents with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities have been highlighted.

Purpose To investigate patients with primary non-respiratory symptoms who underwent abdomen/pelvis or cervical spine/neck CT with unsuspected findings highly suspicious for pulmonary COVID-19. Materials and Methods This retrospective study from March 10, 2020 to April 6, 2020 involved three institutions, two in a region considered a hotspot (area of high prevalence) for COVID-19. Patients without known COVID-19 were included who presented to the emergency room (ER) with primary non-respiratory [gastrointestinal (GI) or neurological] symptoms, had lung parenchymal findings suspicious for COVID-19 on a non-chest CT but no concurrent chest CT and had COVID-19 testing in the ER. Group 1 patients had RT PCR obtained pre-CT read (COVID-19 suspected on presentation); Group 2 had RT PCR obtained post-CT read (COVID-19 not suspected). Presentation and imaging findings were compared and outcomes were evaluated. Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis. Results Group 1 comprised 62 patients [31 men, 31 women, mean age 67(SD \u00B117) years] and group 2 comprised 57 patients [28 men, 29 women, mean age 63(SD \u00B1 16) years). Cough and fever were more common in group 1 (37/62, 60%, 29/62, 47%) than group 2 (9/57, 16%, 12/57, 21%) respectively, with no significant difference in the remaining symptoms. There were 101 abdomen/pelvis and 18 cervical spine/neck CTs. In Group 1, non-chest CT findings provided the initial evidence of COVID-19 related pneumonia in 32/62 (52%); for Group 2, it was 44/57 (77%). Overall, the most common CT findings were ground glass opacity (114/119, 96%) and consolidation (47/119,40%). 29/119 (24%) patients required major interventions (vasopressor medication or intubation) and 27/119 (23%) died. Patients who underwent cervical spine/neck CT had worse outcomes than those with abdominal/pelvic CT (p =0.01). Conclusion In a substantial percentage of patients with primary non-respiratory symptoms who underwent non-chest CT, the CT provided the first evidence of COVID-19 related pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hossain, Rydhwana; Lazarus, Matthew S; Roudenko, Alexandra; Dako, Farouk; Mehta, Varun; Alis, Jonathan; Zalta, Benjamin; Lei, Brandon; Haramati, Linda B; White, Charles S","journal":"Radiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020201743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391741/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["Group","RT PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-chest CT findings","post-CT","pre-CT","pelvic CT","common CT findings","non-chest CT scans","concurrent chest CT","pulmonary COVID","Results Group","initial evidence of COVID","primary non-respiratory symptoms","unsuspected findings","substantial percentage of patients","Background Atypical manifestations of COVID","cervical spine","imaging findings","remaining symptoms","lung parenchymal findings suspicious","pelvis","RT PCR","women","neck CTs","abdomen","SD","mean age","related pneumonia","presentation","years","unsuspected pulmonary disease","worse outcomes","Fisher exact tests","major interventions","vasopressor medication","ground glass opacity","area of high prevalence","hotspot","Descriptive statistics","intubation","emergency room","Materials","Methods","retrospective study","region","analysis","significant difference","Conclusion","fever","testing","Purpose","Cough","pandemic","institutions","consolidation"],"language":"en"},

The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world. OBJECTIVE We examined risk factors, including the use of social media use, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and health professionals in the epicentre, Wuhan, China. METHODS We conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1,577 community adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan. Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff \u2265 3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff \u2265 3), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression. RESULTS One fifth of respondents in the community reported probable anxiety (23\u00B78%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22\u00B70 to 26\u00B74) and probable depression (19\u00B72%; 95% CI, 17\u00B75 to 21\u00B75). Similarly, one in five surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (22\u00B70%; 95% CI, 16\u00B76 to 28\u00B71) or probable depression (19\u00B72%; 95% CI, 14\u00B71 to 25\u00B71). Around one third of community-based adults and health professionals spent \uF0B32 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media. Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending \uF0B32 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults. Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults. CONCLUSIONS The internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted on excessive time spent on COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks. Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ni, Michael Y; Yang, Lin; Leung, Candi Mc; Li, Na; Yao, Xiaoxin I; Wang, Yishan; Leung, Gabriel M; Cowling, Benjamin J; Liao, Qiuyan","journal":"JMIR public health and surveillance","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365044/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WeChat"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["probable anxiety","probable depression","community adults","use of social media use","COVID","social media platform","surveyed health professionals","community-based adults","Social support","online social networks","mental health consequences","community-wide interventions","Patient Health Questionnaire","news","pandemic","Wuhan","China","validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder","cutoff","hours","online survey","Online platforms","daily routines","risk factors","draconian interventions","infodemic","emotional contagion","epicentre","caution","respondents","Multivariable logistic regression analysis","excessive time","telemedicine","Close contact","individuals","countermeasures","BACKGROUND","WeChat","toll","internet","countries","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","confidence interval","CONCLUSIONS","world","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To be able to uncover reliable and valid findings, more robust panel estimation methods were employed for the study. From the heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence tests, the study\u0027s panels were heterogeneous and cross-sectionally dependent. Also, all the series were non-stationary at levels, but gained stationarity after first difference. Further, the Fisher test and the Westerlund and Edgerton bootstrap test found the variables to be cointegrated in the long run. The CCEMG and the DCCEMG estimators were used to explore the long-run equilibrium relationship amid the series, and from the results of the whole sample, CO2 emissions and renewable energy consumption (REC) had no vital influence on economic growth (GDP) in both estimators. However, the results were a bit different in the sub-panels. Also from the whole sample, control variables urbanization (URB) and population growth (POP) had no material effect on GDP in both estimators. The results were, however, dissimilar in the sub-panels. Finally, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin test was employed to examine the causalities amid the series, and the results were diverse in the various panels.

Conclusions about HRQL are difficult to make as the participants are likely drawn from different countries. A global estimate of HRQL with estimates of variation would permit pooling of data from diverse sources. The aim was to estimate a global HRQL score of typically developing children and adolescents on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL\u2122) and to identify sources of variation across studies. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in December 2018 on four databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Inclusion criteria were all population health studies or validation studies using the self-report version of the PedsQL\u2122 for typically developing children aged 5 to 18 years. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted. RESULTS A total of 66 studies with a sample size of 67,805 participants were included in this analysis. The average QOL score across all studies was 80.9 (CI 78.6-83.2). Univariate analyses showed that region, minimum age of sample and income of country, was associated with the total HRQL score. Subgroup analysis showed that there was an effect of age and region on HRQL scores. CONCLUSION Results of this review provide ranges of pediatric HRQL across personal factors and regions that can be used for normative comparisons of HRQL. Interpretation of scores on generic measures should always take into consideration the contextual influences in the child\u0027s life.

Methods: Epidemiological investigation was conducted to collect the information of confirmed COVID-19 cases, including demographic, epidemiological and clinical information. Results: As of 25 February 2020, a total of 91 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in Gansu. The epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu can be divided as three different stages, i.e. imported case stage, imported-case plus indigenous case stage, and indigenous case stage. A total of 63 cases were clustered cases (69.23%), 3 cases were medical staff infected with non-occupational exposure. The initial symptoms included fever (54.95%, 50/91), cough (52.75%, 48/91), or fatigue (28.57%, 26/91), the proportion of each symptom showed a decreasing trend along with the three epidemic stages, but only the differences in proportions of fever (trend \u03C72=2.20, P\u003C0.05) and fatigue (trend \u03C72=3.18, P\u003C0.05) among the three epidemic stages were statistically significant. The cases with critical severe symptoms accounted for 42.85% (6/14), 23.73% (14/59) and 16.67% (3/18), respectively, in three epidemic stages, showed a decreasing trend (H=6.45, P\u003C0.05). Also, the incubation period prolonged along with the epidemic stage (F=51.65, P\u003C0.01), but the intervals between disease onset and hospital visit (F=5.32, P\u003C0.01), disease onset and diagnosis (F=5.25, P\u003C0.01) became shorter along with the epidemic stage. Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) had decreased from 2.61 in imported case stage to 0.66 in indigenous case stage. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu was caused by the imported cases, and about 2/3 cases were clustered ones. No medical worker was observed to be infected by occupational exposure. With the progression of COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu, the change in initial symptom and incubation period suggests, the early screening cannot only depend on body temperature monitoring.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gou, F X; Zhang, X S; Yao, J X; Yu, D S; Wei, K F; Zhang, H; Yang, X T; Yang, J J; Liu, H X; Cheng, Y; Jiang, X J; Zheng, Y H; Wu, B; Liu, X F; Li, H","journal":"Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200229-00216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32234127/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Gansu"],"keyphrases":["epidemic of COVID","imported cases","imported case stage","clustered cases","indigenous case stage","different epidemic stages","different stages","progression of COVID","epidemiological characteristics of COVID","information of confirmed COVID","decreasing trend","trend \u03C72","Gansu province","disease onset","Epidemiological investigation","initial symptoms","total","fatigue","incubation period prolonged","non-occupational exposure","medical staff","proportions of fever","clinical information","medical worker","clustered ones","critical severe symptoms","change","hospital visit","demographic","differences","early screening","intervals","diagnosis","basic reproduction number","R0","body temperature monitoring","Methods","Objective","Conclusions","Results","cough"],"language":"en"},

The positive result of nucleic acid test is a golden criterion to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the detection features remain unclear. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis in 5,630 high-risk individuals receiving SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in Wuhan, China, and investigated their characteristics and diagnosis rates. RESULTS The overall diagnosis rate was 34.7% (1,952/5,630). Male (P = 0.025) and older age (P = 2.525 \u00D7 10-39) were two significant risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. People were generally susceptible, and most cases concentrated in people of 30- to 69-years-old. Besides, we investigated the association between diagnosis rate and the number of testing in 501 subjects. Results revealed a 1.27-fold improvement (35.5%/27.9%) of diagnosis rate from testing once to twice (P = 5.847 \u00D7 10-9), and a 1.43-fold improvement (39.9%/27.9%) from testing once to three times (P = 7.797 \u00D7 10-14). More than three testing times was not helpful for further improvement. However, this improvement was not observed in subjects with pneumonia (P = 0.097). CONCLUSION All populations are susceptible to SARS-Cov-2 infection, and male and older age are two significant risk factors. Increasing the number of testing could significantly improve diagnosis rates, except for subjects with pneumonia. It is recommended to test twice in those high-risk individuals whose results are negative for the first time, and to perform three testing times is better if available.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Na; Zhu, Yaowu; Wang, Xiong; Peng, Jing; Liu, Weiyong; Wang, Feng; Lu, Yanjun; Cheng, Liming; Sun, Ziyong","journal":"JCI insight","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.137662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352933/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","testing times","number of testing","diagnosis rates","infection","overall diagnosis rate","subjects","Results","fold improvement","significant risk factors of SARS","older age","high-risk individuals","Male","People","nucleic acid tests","novel viral pneumonia","positive result of nucleic acid test","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","golden criterion","BACKGROUND","China","retrospective analysis","Wuhan","populations","COVID","detection features","characteristics","CONCLUSION","association","METHODS","cases","years-old","world"],"language":"en"},

The photophysical (UV-Vis, PL) and biological properties of all of the prepared compounds were studied. It was found that the amine with the n-hexyl group in EtOH had the highest PL quantum yield (\u0424 = 85%) compared to the others. Moreover, the chelating properties of the azomethines with the n-hexyl group (1a, 1b, 1c) were tested against various cations (Al3\u002B, Ba2\u002B, Co2\u002B, Cu2\u002B, Cr3\u002B, Fe2\u002B, Fe3\u002B, Mn2\u002B, Ni2\u002B, Pb2\u002B, Sr2\u002B and Zn2\u002B) in an acetonitrile, acetone and PBS/AC mixture.

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has infected thousands of people and placed enormous stress on healthcare system. Apart from being an infectious disease, it may affect human behavior and healthcare resource allocation which potentially cause treatment delay in MI. METHODS This was a single center cross-sectional observational study. From November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, we compared outcome of patients admitted for acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) before (group 1) and after (group 2) January 25, 2020 which was the date when Hong Kong hospitals launched emergency response measures to combat COVID-19. RESULTS There was a reduction in daily emergency room attendance since January 25, 2020 (group 1,327/day vs. group 2,231/day) and 149 patients with diagnosis of MI were included into analysis (group 1 N = 85 vs. group 2 N = 64). For STEMI, patients in group 2 tended to have longer symptom-to-first medical contact time and more presented out of revascularization window (group 1 27.8 vs. group 2 33%). The primary composite outcome of in-hospital death, cardiogenic shock, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) and use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was significantly worse in group 2 (14.1 vs. 29.7%, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS More MI patients during COVID-19 outbreak had complicated in-hospital course and worse outcomes. Besides direct infectious complications, cardiology community has to acknowledge the indirect effect of communicable disease on our patients and system of care.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tam, Chor-Cheung Frankie; Cheung, Kent-Shek; Lam, Simon; Wong, Anthony; Yung, Arthur; Sze, Michael; Fang, Jonathan; Tse, Hung-Fat; Siu, Chung-Wah","journal":"Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography \u0026 Interventions","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.28943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","China"],"keyphrases":["group","MI patients","outcome of patients","COVID","diagnosis of MI","non-ST elevation MI","acute ST-elevation MI","healthcare system","infectious disease","day","Hong Kong hospitals","outcome of myocardial infarction","primary composite outcome","hospital death","hospital course","worse outcomes","system of care","emergency response measures","healthcare resource allocation","direct infectious complications","daily emergency room attendance","indirect effect of communicable disease","ventricular tachycardia","infected thousands of people","cardiology community","cardiogenic shock","enormous stress","human behavior","VF","METHODS","fibrillation","reduction","pandemic","MCS","NSTEMI","outbreak","single center cross-sectional observational study","treatment delay","medical contact time","VT","mechanical circulatory support","date","revascularization window","analysis","longer symptom","China","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders. The primary management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immune based therapies. However, these therapies may weaken the immune system and potentially place IBD patients at increased risk of infections and infectious complications including those from COVID-19. AIM To summarise the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID-19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population. METHODS A literature review on IBD, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarized and critically examined. RESULTS IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID-19. IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccine. If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked. CONCLUSION IBD patient management presents a challenge in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The primary focus should remain on keeping bowel inflammation controlled and encouraging medication adherence.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Ani, Aysha; Prentice, Ralley; Rentsch, Clarissa; Johnson, Doug; Ardalan, Zaid; Heerasing, Neel; Garg, Mayur; Campbell, Sian; Sasadeusz, Joe; Macrae, Fin; Ng, Siew C; Rubin, David T; Christensen, Britt","journal":"Alimentary pharmacology \u0026 therapeutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348598/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBD management","IBD therapies","current COVID","IBD population","RESULTS IBD patients","increased risk of COVID","IBD medication adherence","CONCLUSION IBD patient management","pandemic","infection risk","SARS-CoV","management options","immune based therapies","primary management of inflammatory bowel disease","increased risk of infections","bowel inflammation","infection resolution","immune suppressing medications","immune system","literature review","potential drug interactions","encouraging medication adherence","disease flare","uncontrolled inflammation","trial medications","primary focus","relevant literature","challenge","unique concerns","possible high dose systemic corticosteroids","date","infectious complications","association","co-morbidities","social distancing","evidence","globe","pneumococcal vaccine","influenza","METHODS","BACKGROUND","virus","public health emergency","regard","borders","scale","nations"],"language":"en"},

Opinions and the behaviours they elicit are complex, so modelling them requires a measure of abstraction and simplification. Here, we develop a differential equation model that couples SIR-type disease dynamics with opinion dynamics. We assume a spectrum of opinions that change based on current levels of infection as well as interactions that to some extent amplify the opinions of like-minded individuals. Susceptibility to infection is based on the level of prophylaxis (disease avoidance) that an opinion engenders. In this setting, we observe how the severity of an epidemic is influenced by the distribution of opinions at disease introduction, the relative rates of opinion and disease dynamics, and the amount of opinion amplification. Some insight is gained by considering how the effective reproduction number is influenced by the combination of opinion and disease dynamics.","publish_time":"2020-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tyson, Rebecca C; Hamilton, Stephanie D; Lo, Aboubakr S; Baumgaertner, Bert O; Krone, Stephen M","journal":"Bulletin of mathematical biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-019-00684-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31932981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["opinion dynamics","disease introduction","disease avoidance","interplay of disease","combination of opinion","opinion amplification","couples SIR-type disease dynamics","relative rates of opinion","distribution of opinions","spectrum of opinions","opinions of like-minded individuals","epidemic","current levels of infection","differential equation model","extent","level of prophylaxis","interactions","outcomes","effective reproduction number","measure of abstraction","simplification","severity","behaviours","setting","Susceptibility","insight"],"language":"en"},

At the same time, Hispanic women remain considerably underrepresented in behavioral weight loss interventions. The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate the evidence related to the effectiveness of weight loss interventions among Hispanic women in the U.S. This review will identify elements of successful weight loss interventions as well as areas for future research. METHODS/DESIGN The following databases will be searched to identify all relevant articles (from inception onwards): PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science (Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index), PsycINFO, CINAHL, Chicano Database, SPORTDiscus, CAB Abstracts, and Google Scholar. We will include randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies of adult women (\u003E 18 years) from Hispanic/Latino background living in the United States. Eligible interventions will target weight-related behaviors (including diet, physical activity, behavior modification and/or their combinations). The review\u0027s primary outcome will be weight change (expressed as change in lbs/kg or body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2)). Three reviewers will independently screen and select data and two will extract data. The methodological quality (or risk of bias) of individual studies will be appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. A narrative synthesis will describe quality and content of the evidence. DISCUSSION The aim of this systematic review is to critically examine existing weight loss interventions for Hispanic women in the U.S. and provide quality evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions on weight loss. Further, this review seeks to identify characteristics of effective interventions and suggest future directions for research efforts targeting weight loss in this population. This review will inform the development of future weight loss interventions for this population.

Placement of blood volume sensors such as bio-impedance sensors close to the arterial sites is essential for the accurate measurement of the pulse waveform. The effect of sensor location relative to the wrist arteries on the pulse waveform had not been studied previously on human subjects. In this paper, we explore the effect of arterial and off-arterial placement of the bio-impedance sensor on important pulse waveform features such as pulse transit time (PTT), which is the travel time of the arterial pressure pulse between two sensors, and diastolic peak error (DPE), a measure of pulse signal sharpness. Placing the current injection and voltage sensing electrodes of a bio-impedance sensor on the radial artery provide greater accuracy for such features. We find that arterial PTT has a significantly lower standard deviation compared to off-arterial PTT indicating better signal quality. Similarly, we observe that DPE is much smaller for arterial bio-impedance which confirms our expectations.

Such determination is particularly challenging because NPs are extremely difficult to detect and quantify once distributed in a biological system. Radiolabelling with positron or gamma emitters and subsequent imaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) are some of the few valid alternatives. However, NPs that degrade or radionuclides that detach or are released from the NPs can cause artefact. Here, submicron-sized poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) stabilised with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were dual radiolabelled using gamma emitters with different energy spectra incorporated into the core and coating. To label the core, 111In-doped iron oxide NPs were encapsulated inside PLGA-NPs during NP preparation, and the BSA coating was labelled by electrophilic substitution using 125I. After intravenous administration into rats, energy-discriminant SPECT resolved each radioisotope independently. Imaging revealed different fates for the core and coating, with a fraction of the two radionuclides co-localising in the liver and lungs for long periods of time after administration, suggesting that NPs are stable in these organs. Organ harvesting followed by gamma counting corroborated the SPECT results. The general methodology reported here represents an excellent alternative for visualising the degradation process of multi-labelled NPs in vivo and can be extended to a wide range of engineered NPs.","publish_time":"2015-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Llop, J; Jiang, P; Marradi, M; G\u00F3mez-Vallejo, V; Echeverr\u00EDa, M; Yu, S; Puigivila, M; Baz, Z; Szczupak, B; P\u00E9rez-Campa\u00F1a, C; Mao, Z; Gao, C; Moya, S E","journal":"Journal of materials chemistry.

Transit bipartition with sleeve gastrectomy is derived from biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and might improve weight loss control. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two series of 71 primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and transit bipartition (TB) with a body mass index \u2265 50 kg/m2 were retrospectively compared after 2 years. Postoperative course, side effects, nutritional status, and weight outcomes were reviewed. Weight was expressed as BMI, percentage of excess BMI lost (%EBMIL), and percentage of total weight lost (%TWL). RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable for age and BMI of 51.9 \u00B1 1.8 for RYGB and 51.6 \u00B1 5 for TB. TB was longer to perform (92 vs 74 min, p \u2264 0.001) with a 30-day complication rate of 4.2% and 5.6%, but there was 1 death after RYGB. Weight loss was greater after TB compared with RYGB with %EBMIL of 85.3 \u00B1 15.8% vs 73.9 \u00B1 17.2% (p = 0.0002). One TB patient suffered from protein malnutrition but none after RYGB. After TB, 7% of the patients experienced \u003E 3 stools a day and 1 patient required revision, while 3 patients had diarrhea after RYGB. Late reoperations were required for 7 and 1 patients after RYGB and TB. Comorbidity improvement was similar. CONCLUSION In a superobese population, TB appeared relatively safer compared with RYGB. It achieved a better weight loss at 2 years with a trend for more digestive side effects.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Topart, Philippe; Becouarn, Guillaume; Finel, Jean-Baptiste","journal":"Obesity surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04691-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418188/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMI","RYGB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RYGB","TB patient","significant weight loss","weight loss control","better weight loss","weight outcomes","percentage of total weight","patients","Y gastric bypass","Transit bipartition","percentage of excess BMI","effects","EBMIL","years","vs","primary laparoscopic Roux-en","superobese populations","day complication rate","nutritional status","duodenal switch","powerful procedure","biliopancreatic diversion","series","sleeve gastrectomy","METHODS","body mass index","revision","trend","protein malnutrition","Postoperative course","m2","groups","PURPOSE","CONCLUSION","diarrhea","Comorbidity improvement","MATERIALS","TWL","Late reoperations","death"],"language":"en"},

CD9 is upregulated in senescent endothelial cells, neointima hyperplasia, and atherosclerotic plaques. However, its role in cellular senescence and atherosclerosis remains undefined. We investigated the potential mechanism for CD9-mediated cellular senescence and its role in atherosclerotic plaque formation. CD9 knockdown in senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells significantly rescued senescence phenotypes, while CD9 upregulation in young cells accelerated senescence. CD9 regulated cellular senescence through a phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase-AKT-mTOR-p53 signal pathway. CD9 expression increased in arterial tissues from humans and rats with age, and in atherosclerotic plaques in humans and mice. Anti-mouse CD9 antibody noticeably prevented the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice and Ldlr-/- mice. Furthermore, CD9 ablation in ApoE-/- mice decreased atherosclerotic lesions in aorta and aortic sinus. These results suggest that CD9 plays critical roles in endothelial cell senescence and consequently the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, implying that CD9 is a novel target for prevention and treatment of vascular aging and atherosclerosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Jung Hee; Kim, Eok-Cheon; Son, Youlim; Lee, Da-Woon; Park, Yong Seop; Choi, Joon Hyuk; Cho, Kyung-Hyun; Kwon, Ki-Sun; Kim, Jae-Ryong","journal":"Cell death and differentiation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-020-0537-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD9 upregulation","CD9 knockdown","CD9 expression","CD9 ablation","cellular senescence","mice","endothelial cell senescence","atherosclerotic plaques","Anti-mouse CD9 antibody","formation of atherosclerotic lesions","senescent endothelial cells","rescued senescence phenotypes","atherosclerotic plaque formation","young cells","ApoE","humans","pathogenesis of atherosclerosis","senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells","cell adhesion","cancer progression","metastasis","kinase-AKT","prevention","phosphatidylinositide","neointima hyperplasia","critical roles","allergic responses","arterial tissues","migration","treatment of vascular aging","rats","age","aorta","mTOR-p53 signal pathway","novel target","kDa tetraspanin membrane protein","aortic sinus","viral infection","potential mechanism","results","Ldlr"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital \u002212 de Octubre,\u0022 Madrid, Spain. RESULTS Three patients (2 men, and one woman, aged 63-88) presented with mild hypersomnia and generalized myoclonus following the onset of the so-called \u0022inflammatory\u0022 phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All of them had presented previously with anosmia. Myoclonus had a stereotypical pattern, being both positive and negative, generalized, with a predominant involvement of nasopharyngeal, facial, and upper limbs areas. These jerky movements occurred spontaneously and were extremely sensitive to multisensory stimuli (auditive and tactile) or voluntary movement, with an exaggerated startle response. Other causes of myoclonus were ruled-out, and none of them had undergone respiratory arrest or significant prolonged hypoxia. All of them improved, at least partially, with immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Our 3 cases highlight the occurrence of myoclonus during the COVID-19 pandemic as a postinfectious/immune-mediated disorder. However, we cannot rule out that SARS-CoV-2 may spread transneuronally to first- and second-order structures connected with the olfactory bulb.

We aimed to test our hypothesis that exposure to intimate partner violence would reduce intervention effectiveness for CMDs in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Cochrane, PubMed databases, trials registries, 3ie, Google Scholar, and forward and backward citations for studies published between database inception and Aug 16, 2019. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for CMDs in LMICs which measured intimate partner violence were included, without language or date restrictions. We approached study authors to obtain unpublished aggregate subgroup data for women who did and did not report intimate partner violence. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychological distress outcomes. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as differences between standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, comparing women who did and who did not report intimate partner violence via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42017078611. FINDINGS Of 8122 records identified, 21 were eligible and data were available for 15 RCTs, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. Anxiety (five interventions, 728 participants) showed a greater response to intervention among women reporting intimate partner violence than among those who did not (difference in standardised mean differences [dSMD] 0\u00B731, 95% CI 0\u00B704 to 0\u00B757, I2=49\u00B74%). No differences in response to intervention were seen in women reporting intimate partner violence for PTSD (eight interventions, n=1436; dSMD 0\u00B714, 95% CI -0\u00B706 to 0\u00B733, I2=42\u00B76%), depression (12 interventions, n=2940; 0\u00B710, -0\u00B704 to 0\u00B725, I2=49\u00B73%), and psychological distress (four interventions, n=1591; 0\u00B707, -0\u00B705 to 0\u00B718, I2=0\u00B70%, p=0\u00B7681). INTERPRETATION Psychological interventions treat anxiety effectively in women with current or recent intimate partner violence exposure in LMICs when delivered by appropriately trained and supervised health-care staff, even when not tailored for this population or targeting intimate partner violence directly. Future research should investigate whether adapting evidence-based psychological interventions for CMDs to address intimate partner violence enhances their acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness in LMICs.

In the United States, planned out-of-hospital births are associated with significantly increased risks of neonatal morbidity and death. In addition, there are obstetric emergencies during out-of-hospital births that can lead to adverse outcomes, partly because of the delay in transporting the woman to the hospital. In other countries with well-integrated obstetric services and well-trained midwives, the differences in outcomes of planned hospital birth and planned home birth are smaller. Women are empowered to make informed decisions when the obstetrician makes ethically justified recommendations, which is known as directive counseling. Recommendations are ethically justified when the outcomes of one form of management is clinically superior to another. The outcomes of morbidity and mortality and of infection control and prevention of planned hospital birth are clinically superior to those of out-of-hospital birth. The obstetrician therefore should recommend planned hospital birth and recommend against planned out-of-hospital birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels for all patients and even more so for pregnant patients and their families. The response in this difficult time should be to mitigate this stress and empower women to make informed decisions by routinely providing counseling that is evidence-based and directive.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gr\u00FCnebaum, Amos; McCullough, Laurence B; Bornstein, Eran; Klein, Risa; Dudenhausen, Joachim W; Chervenak, Frank A","journal":"Journal of perinatal medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["outcomes of planned hospital birth","hospital births","prevention of planned hospital birth","planned home birth","pandemic","outcomes of morbidity","COVID","adverse outcomes","pregnant women","informed decisions","obstetrician","pregnant patients","directive counseling","justified recommendations","increased risks of neonatal morbidity","obstetric emergencies","stress levels","well-integrated obstetric services","well-trained midwives","differences","infection control","mortality","countries","death","coronavirus disease","delay","place","form of management","difficult time","response","worries","addition","babies","evidence","families","woman","United States"],"language":"en"},

We first validated our model using the well-studied influenza viruses and then compared the pathogenesis processes between the two viruses. The interaction between host innate and adaptive immune responses was found to be a potential cause for the higher severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Specifically the timing mismatch between the two immune responses has a major impact on the disease progression. The adaptive immune response of the COVID-19 patients are more likely to come before the peak of viral load, while the opposite is true for influenza patients. This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in COVID-19 patients while enhancing the viral clearance in influenza patients. Stronger adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications. Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high risk COVID-19 patients. Suppressing the adaptive immune response temporarily and avoiding its interference with the innate immune response may allow the innate immunity to more efficiently clear the virus.

The ability of a pilot study to inform an efficacy/effectiveness trial relies on careful considerations in the design, delivery, and interpretation of the pilot results to avoid exaggerated early discoveries that may lead to subsequent failed efficacy/effectiveness trials. \u0022Risk of generalizability biases (RGB)\u0022 in pilot studies may reduce the probability of replicating results in a larger efficacy/effectiveness trial. We aimed to generate an operational list of potential RGBs and to evaluate their impact in pairs of published pilot studies and larger, more well-powered trial on the topic of childhood obesity. METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review to identify published pilot studies that had a published larger-scale trial of the same or similar intervention. Searches were updated and completed through December 31st, 2018. Eligible studies were behavioral interventions involving youth (\u226418 yrs) on a topic related to childhood obesity (e.g., prevention/treatment, weight reduction, physical activity, diet, sleep, screen time/sedentary behavior). Extracted information included study characteristics and all outcomes. A list of 9 RGBs were defined and coded: intervention intensity bias, implementation support bias, delivery agent bias, target audience bias, duration bias, setting bias, measurement bias, directional conclusion bias, and outcome bias. Three reviewers independently coded for the presence of RGBs. Multi-level random effects meta-analyses were performed to investigate the association of the biases to study outcomes. RESULTS A total of 39 pilot and larger trial pairs were identified. The frequency of the biases varied: delivery agent bias (19/39 pairs), duration bias (15/39), implementation support bias (13/39), outcome bias (6/39), measurement bias (4/39), directional conclusion bias (3/39), target audience bias (3/39), intervention intensity bias (1/39), and setting bias (0/39).

The frustrating thing is that, right now, this virus is still new. It only came to the attention of the World Health Organization at the end of December. Very few cases in thalassemia have so far been reported; is this due to lack of testing or a true lack of infection/susceptibility? However, we believe that more data should be collected to better characterise the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with thalassemias. Therefore, a multicenter registry and the collection of comprehensive data from both positive COVID-19 thalassemia major and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia are necessary to clarify debated issues. In the meantime an early and vigilant monitoring along with high quality supportive care are needed in thalassemic patients at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karimi, Mehran; De Sanctis, Vincenzo","journal":"Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i2.9592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420925/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-COV","thalassemic patients","true lack of infection","thalassemia major","high risk","impact of SARS","non-transfusion dependent thalassemia","positive COVID","lack of testing","collection of comprehensive data","high quality supportive care","potential higher risk of complications","vigilant monitoring","World Health Organization","multicenter registry","debated issues","attention","meantime","normal population","susceptibility","blind","coronavirus","thalassemias","frustrating thing","cases"],"language":"en"},

Impediments to address this question are primarily due to critical experimental barriers. An integrated perspective on large scale neural information processing requires an in vivo approach that can combine the advantages of exhaustively observing all neurons dedicated to a given type of stimulus, and simultaneously achieve a resolution that is precise enough to capture individual neuron activity. Current experimental data from in vivo observations are either restricted to a small fraction of the total number of neurons, or are based on larger brain volumes but at a low spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently, fundamental questions as to how sensory information is represented on a population scale remain unanswered. In Drosophila melanogaster, the mushroom body (MB) represents an excellent model to analyze sensory coding and memory plasticity. In this work, we present an experimental setup coupled with a dedicated computational method that provides in vivo measurements of the activity of hundreds of densely packed somata uniformly spread in the MB. We exploit spinning-disk confocal 3D imaging over time of the whole MB cell body layer in vivo while it is exposed to olfactory stimulation. Importantly, to derive individual signal from densely packed somata, we have developed a fully automated image analysis procedure that takes advantage of the specificities of our data. After anisotropy correction, our approach operates a dedicated spot detection and registration over the entire time sequence to transform trajectories to identifiable clusters. This enabled us to discard spurious detections and reconstruct missing ones in a robust way. We demonstrate that this approach outperformed existing methods in this specific context and made possible high-throughput analysis of approximately 500 single somata uniformly spread over the MB in various conditions. Applying this approach, we find that learned experiences change the population code of odor representations in the MB. After long-term memory (LTM) formation, we quantified an increase in responsive somata count and a stable single neuron signal. We predict that this method, which should further enable studying the population pattern of neuronal activity, has the potential to uncover fine details of sensory processing and memory plasticity.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Delestro, Felipe; Scheunemann, Lisa; Pedrazzani, M\u00E9lanie; Tchenio, Paul; Preat, Thomas; Genovesio, Auguste","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64060-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346011/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["approach","single somata","packed somata","individual neuron activity","sensory information","population scale","activity of hundreds","population pattern of neuronal activity","memory plasticity","MB cell body layer","sensory coding","responsive somata count","experimental setup","long-term memory","individual signal","dedicated computational method","Current experimental data","fine details of sensory processing","stable single neuron signal","concerted activity of neuronal populations shape behavior","dedicated spot detection","critical experimental barriers","large scale neural information processing","mushroom body","population code of odor representations","temporal resolution","entire time sequence","total number of neurons","possible high-throughput analysis","automated image analysis procedure","specific context","registration","D imaging","integrated perspective","missing ones","trajectories","measurements","potential","excellent model","spinning-disk confocal","larger brain volumes","small fraction","existing methods","increase","observations","experiences","identifiable clusters","Drosophila melanogaster","spurious detections","robust way","given type of stimulus","specificities","LTM","fundamental questions","anisotropy correction","work","various conditions","advantages","olfactory stimulation","Impediments"],"language":"en"},

However, due to their similar morphological characteristics and insufficient molecular identification, the taxonomic classification of black aspergilli remains ill-defined. The production of specialised metabolites is often unique for species among black aspergilli and could be used as diagnostic chemical markers for species identification. In this study, chemical investigation of Aspergillus tubingensis OUCMBIII 143291 led to the discovery of the diagnostic chemical marker asperazine, a complex diketopiperazine heterodimer, as well as two previously undescribed analogues, asperazine B and C. In addition, an undescribed 2-benzylpyridin-4(1H)-one-containing amide, pestalamide D, along with four known related metabolites were isolated. Their chemical structures, including their absolute configurations, were established on the basis of comprehensive spectral analysis and chiral HPLC analysis of the acidic hydrolysates. Asperazines B and C can serve as potential chemical markers for distinguishing A. tubingensis from A. niger, two representative species of black aspergilli that are usually incorrectly identified. Moreover, the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antifungal activity against eight phytopathogenic fungi including Alternaria alternata, A. brassicae, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum lagenarium, Fusarium oxysporum, Gaeumannomyces graminis, Penicillium digitatum, and Valsa mali. Pestalamide D exhibited significant activities against B. cinerea, C. lagenarium, and V. mali, with MIC values of 4, 8, and 8 \u03BCg/mL, respectively, compared with the positive controls carbendazim (MICs = 8, 4, and 4 \u03BCg/mL) and prochloraz (MICs = 8, 8, and 4 \u03BCg/mL).

The host immunity of COVID-19 patients is unknown. METHODS The routine laboratory tests and host immunity in COVID-19 patients with different severity of illness were compared after patient admission. RESULTS A total of 65 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were classified as mild (n=30), severe (n=20), and extremely severe (n=15) illness. Many routine laboratory tests such as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer were increased in severe and extremely severe patients. The absolute numbers of CD4\u002B T cells, CD8\u002B T cells and B cells were all gradually decreased with increased severity of illness. The activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD45RO expressed on CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells were increased in severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The co-stimulatory molecule CD28 had opposite results. The percentage of natural regulatory T cells was decreased in extremely severe patients. The percentage of IFN-\u03B3 producing CD8\u002B T cells was increased in both severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The percentage of IFN-\u03B3 producing CD4\u002B T cells was increased in extremely severe patients. The IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-10 were all increased in extremely severe patients. The activation of DC and B cells was decreased in extremely severe patients. CONCLUSIONS The number and function of T cells are inconsistent in COVID-19 patients. The hyperfunction of CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells is associated with the pathogenesis of extremely severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Feng; Hou, Hongyan; Luo, Ying; Tang, Guoxing; Wu, Shiji; Huang, Min; Liu, Weiyong; Zhu, Yaowu; Lin, Qun; Mao, Liyan; Fang, Minghao; Zhang, Huilan; Sun, Ziyong","journal":"JCI insight","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.137799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32324595/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe patients","severe outbreak","mild patients","severe SARS-CoV","positive patients","function of T cells","B cells","percentage of natural regulatory T cells","CD8","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","increased severity of illness","host immunity of COVID","hyperfunction of CD4","percentage of IFN","routine laboratory tests","absolute numbers of CD4","different severity of illness","Coronavirus Disease","opposite results","activation markers","activation of DC","ferritin","lactate dehydrogenase","co-stimulatory molecule CD28","pathogenesis","HLA-DR","D-dimer","METHODS","CD45RO","CONCLUSIONS","infection","patient admission","BACKGROUND","total","China"],"language":"en"},

Previous literature reviews have demonstrated the effectiveness of using SBL in nursing education. However, there is a need to explore how and why it works to expand the theoretical foundation of SBL. Realist reviews are a theory-based approach to synthesizing existing evidence on how complex programs work in particular contexts or settings. OBJECTIVE This review aims to understand how, why, and in what circumstances the use of simulation affects learning as part of the bachelor\u0027s program in nursing. METHODS A realist review will be conducted in accordance with the realist template for a systematic review. In particular, we will identify and explore the underlying assumption of how SBL is supposed to work, that is, identify and explore program theories of SBL. The review will be carried out as an iterative process of searching, appraising, and synthesizing the evidence to uncover theoretical concepts that explain the causal effects of SBL. In the final section of the review, we will involve stakeholders in the Norwegian community in a web-based Delphi survey to ensure that the emerging theoretical framework derived from the published literature aligns with stakeholders\u0027 experience in practice. RESULTS The Norwegian Centre for Research Data (project number 60415) has approved the study. We have performed an initial literature search, whereas quality appraisal and data extraction are ongoing processes. CONCLUSIONS The final outcome of the review is anticipated to extend the theoretical foundation for using simulation as an integrated component of the bachelor\u0027s program in nursing. Furthermore, the findings will be used to produce a briefing document containing guidance for national stakeholders in the community of simulation-based nursing education. Finally, the review findings will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal as well as national and international conferences.

CONCLUSION A selective use of episiotomy combined with Couder\u0027s maneuver could reduce the incidence of perineal tears, particularly second-degree perineal tears, without increasing the rate of obstetrical anal sphincter injuries.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Forey, Pierre-Louis; Lallemant, Marine; Bourtembourg-Matras, Aude; Eckman-Lacroix, Astrid; Ramanah, Rajeev; Riethmuller, Didier; Mottet, Nicolas","journal":"Archives of gynecology and obstetrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-020-05572-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEC","Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists","OSE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SEC cohort","OSE cohort","incidence of perineal tears","second-degree perineal tears","type of perineal tears","practice of Couder\u0027s maneuver","selective episiotomies","patients","selective use of episiotomy","labia minora tears","rate of obstetrical anal sphincter injuries","decrease","cohorts","Royal College of Obstetricians","mono-centric study","retrospective","Gynaecologists","increase","university maternity unit","spontaneous term deliveries","comparative","RCOG","impact","weeks of gestation","primary outcome","cephalic presentation","number of intact perinea","METHODS","classification","CONCLUSION","midwives","primiparous women","PURPOSE","total"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 3D passive polarizing display (3DPPD) and a novel 3D head-mounted display (3DHMD; HMS-3000MT) on the performance of the first laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair by novices and compare both systems with standard high-definition 2D (HD2D) laparoscopy. METHODS Patients with symptomatic inguinal hernia underwent transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach hernia repair using 3DHMD, 3DPPD, or a conventional HD2D laparoscopic system. All surgeries were performed for the first time by three laparoscopically novice surgeons. Operative performance was compared in terms of the time taken for mesh placement and peritoneal suturing under standardized conditions. Additionally, visual perception parameters and adverse effects were assessed. RESULTS The use of both 3D techniques shortened the time required for mesh placement and peritoneal suturing compared with the conventional HD2D approach. Generally, 3D laparoscopy was superior to HD2D laparoscopy in terms of visual perception parameters such as depth perception, sharpness, ghosting, and contrast. However, compared with the use of HD2D laparoscopy, the use of 3DHMD significantly impaired a surgeon\u0027s comfort, with the greatest impairment caused by ear discomfort, headaches, and facial and physical discomforts. CONCLUSIONS The 3DHMD and 3DPPD systems showed clear improvement in first hernia repair laparoscopy by novice surgeons in terms of surgical performance, as well as visual perception; however, the 3DHMD system was not superior to the 3DPPD system. The reduction in training time for new surgeons is obviously advantageous. In this respect, the 3D equipment may be a worthwhile investment.","publish_time":"2019-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanani, M; Cernat, V; Beyer, K; Walschus, U; Schulze, T; Heidecke, C D; Patrzyk, M","journal":"Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-019-02065-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31745653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of HD2D laparoscopy","hernia repair laparoscopy","D equipment","D techniques","DHMD system","approach hernia repair","terms of visual perception parameters","DPPD systems","conventional HD2D approach","conventional HD2D laparoscopic system","laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair","D head-mounted display","D passive polarizing display","terms of surgical performance","depth perception","new surgeons","surgical skills of novice surgeons","training time","symptomatic inguinal hernia","peritoneal suturing","mesh placement","Operative performance","transabdominal preperitoneal","TAPP","clear improvement","headaches","novices","greatest impairment","standard high-definition","ear discomfort","sharpness","novel","learning curve","METHODS Patients","standardized conditions","ghosting","surgeon\u0027s comfort","HMS","reduction","adverse effects","experimental settings","physical discomforts","worthwhile investment","MT","BACKGROUND Three-dimensional","contrast","respect","CONCLUSIONS","study","surgeries"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The epidemic feature of COVID-19 was described by different phases and was used to observe the effectiveness of intervention. Hierarchical spot map was drawn to clarify the distribution and transmission risk of infection sources at different time points. The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Asymptomatic-Recovered model was established to estimate case numbers without intervention and compare with the actual number of cases to determine the effect of intervention. The positive rate of the nucleic acid test was used to reflect the risk of human exposure. A survey on COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude and behaviors were used to estimate the abilities of personal protection and emergency response. Results: The epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen experienced the rising, plateau and decline stage. The case number increased rapidly at the beginning, with short duration of peak period. Although the epidemic curve showed human-to-human transmission, the \u0022trailing\u0022 was not obvious. From the spot map, during the intervention period, the source of infection was widely distributed. More cases and higher transmission risk were observed in areas with higher population density. After the effective intervention measures, both infection sources and the risk of transmission decreased. After compared with the estimated case numbers without intervention, actual number proved the COVID-19 control strategies were effective. The positive rate of nucleic acid test for high risk populations decreased and no new cases reported since February 16. Shenzhen citizens had high knowledge, attitude and behavior level, and high protection ability and emergency response. Conclusion: Although the response initiated by the health administration department played a key role at the early stage of the epidemic, it was not enough to contain the outbreak of COVID-19. The first-level emergency response initiated by provincial and municipal government was effective and ensured the start of work resumption after the Spring Festival. Metropolitans like Shenzhen can also achieve the goals of strategies and measures for containment and mitigation of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zou, X; Wu, Y S; Liu, X J; Huang, S L; He, J F; Zhao, J; Wu, N; Zhang, R L; Mei, S J; Liu, P Y; Zhang, Z; Shi, X L; Lyu, X; Wei, L; Ma, Q S; Lu, J H; Li, Y; Feng, T J; Peng, C Q; Zhang, S X; Xia, J J","journal":"Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200316-00360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shenzhen"],"keyphrases":["epidemic of COVID","risk of transmission","outbreak of COVID","mitigation of COVID","intervention period","effect of intervention","epidemic feature of COVID","higher transmission risk","effective intervention measures","transmission risk of infection sources","human transmission","effectiveness of intervention","high risk populations","high knowledge","level emergency response","risk of human exposure","control strategies","high population density","actual number of cases","goals of strategies","Shenzhen citizens","epidemic curve","high protection ability","attitude","positive rate of nucleic acid test","source of infection","higher population density","estimated case numbers","new cases","outbreak control","metropolitans","Hierarchical spot map","behavior level","related knowledge","early stage","different phases","abilities of personal protection","different time points","short duration of peak period","key role","areas","health administration department","beginning","municipal government","containment","distribution","start of work resumption","behaviors","model","strong mobility","Spring Festival","Infectious-Asymptomatic","plateau","survey","Methods","feasibility","study","Results","Objectives","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

It seems appropriate, then, to put into practice a novel approach able to provide the scientific community and other interested parties with quality evidence that is actionable, and rapidly and efficiently produced. Methods and analysis We designed a protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). We will search for primary studies and systematic reviews that answer different questions related to COVID-19 using both a centralized repository (Epistemonikos database) and a manual search in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will also search for literature in several other sources. At least two researchers will independently undertake the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the quality of the included studies. We will synthesize data for each question using meta-analysis, when possible, and we will prepare Summary of Findings tables according to the GRADE approach.

All patients showed marked improvement of their lesions in a few days. After the introduction of the conventional penicillin regimen, the lesions further improved and VDRL titers declined at least 4-fold within 6 months in all patients. Tinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole derivative as well as metronidazole but with a longer plasma half-life. It is activated intracellularly by bacterial/parasitic enzymes to a redox cytotoxic intermediate that damages large protein molecules and inhibits repair and transcription of DNA affecting also the cell wall. With this action, tinidazole might also have a synergic action with penicillin and doxycycline, facilitating the entry of such drugs. It is possible that tinidazole has the same bactericidal action on spirochetes other than Borrelia, such as Treponema pallidum, explaining its rapid therapeutic action on the lesions of early syphilis. Whether this action could be confirmed by studies on larger series of patients, tinidazole might be considered in case of allergy to penicillin or other antibiotics usually prescribed in syphilis.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drago, Francesco; Ciccarese, Giulia; Rebora, Alfredo; Parodi, Aurora","journal":"Journal of clinical pharmacology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408379/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VDRL","Treponema"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tinidazole","early syphilis patients","lesions of early syphilis","bactericidal action","synergic action","conventional penicillin treatment","secondary syphilis","rapid therapeutic action","conventional penicillin regimen","larger series of patients","days","damages large protein molecules","repair","start","metronidazole","complete resolution of maculopapular eruption","parasitic enzymes","Borrelia","trichomonas vaginalis infection","transcription of DNA","Treponema pallidum","fold","doxycycline","studies","marked improvement","longer plasma half-life","incidental observation","VDRL titers","entry","nitroimidazole derivative","spirochetes","case of allergy","introduction","antibiotics","cell wall","months","times","drugs"],"language":"en"},

The global mortality burden of tobacco use lies predominantly in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). There is much evidence on the effectiveness of tobacco cessation RCTs in high-income nations.

To effectively design randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that mitigate tobacco-related harms in LMICs, further understanding of RCTs in this environment will be helpful. We will provide quality evidence regarding the scope of tobacco cessation RCTs in LMICs. METHODS A scoping review of tobacco cessation RCTs will be conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science and Sociological Abstracts will be searched to capture current literature. We will review RCTs that have already been done on tobacco cessation in the LMICs. The key outcome will be tobacco cessation in adults. Examples of the key outcome include smoking abstinence and reduction of tobacco use. Study selection will conform to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines and study quality assessed with a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration\u0027s instrument.

The BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel EZ (RP EZ) is a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-waived respiratory pathogen PCR panel which rapidly tests for 14 common respiratory organisms. The aim of this study was to identify the distribution of organisms seen in pediatric clinics and to determine if utilization of this point-of-care test improved disease management, while exploring impact on clinic workflow. METHODS From January 2018 through January 2019, when clinically appropriate, patients were tested by the RP EZ and/or antigen tests (Clinic A) or antigen test only (Clinic B). Residual samples from Clinic B antigen tests were frozen and later tested on the RP EZ for definitive pathogen identification. Patient data and prescription records were extracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS A total of 430 patients had RP EZ tests performed, and at least 1 organism was detected in 70.4% of patients. The most common organisms identified were human rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. Appropriate treatment occurred for 93.6% of patients when the RP EZ was performed (Clinic A) versus 87.9% of patients who had only antigen tests performed (Clinic B, P = 0.0445). Utilization of RP EZ testing also significantly reduced appointment duration time (48.0 versus 54.9 minutes, P = 0.0009). Three false-positive influenza B results were identified by antigen testing.

Results showed that the nitrate and phosphorus removal efficiency reached 100.00% (2.697 mg\u00B7L-1\u00B7h-1) and 81.93% (1.533 mg\u00B7L-1\u00B7h-1) under the conditions of carbon/nitrogen of 2:1, Fe2\u002B concentration of 30 mg\u00B7L-1 and HRT of 6 h. The precipitation of bioreactor, which identified as FeOOH by XRD, had significant adsorption on tetracycline. The results of high-throughput sequencing indicated that strain L2 played a significant role in denitrification. This bioreactor provided effective method for the treatment of polluted water contaminated by nitrate, phosphorus, and tetracycline.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Jun Feng; Li, Guo Qing; Wen, Qiong; Xue, Lei; Chen, Chang Lun; Huang, Ting Lin","journal":"Bioprocess and biosystems engineering","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00449-020-02365-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418134/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tetracycline","simultaneous removal of nitrate","phosphorus removal efficiency","Strain L2","bacteria","conditions of carbon","concentration","HRT","significant adsorption","significant role","nitrogen ratio","results of high","effects of carbon","precipitation of bioreactor","optimum conditions","Single denitrification","initial Fe2","treatment of polluted water","throughput sequencing","effective method","FeOOH","XRD","polyvinyl alcohol","chitosan","bioreactors","iron","studies"],"language":"en"},

METHODS This study included patients who underwent RAPN for lateral renal tumors between 2013 and 2019. Lateral tumors were defined as X of A factors in the RENAL nephrometry score. In total, 290 and 48 patients with TP and RP, respectively, were included in the analysis. To minimize the effects of selection bias, the following variables were adjusted using 1:1 propensity score matching: age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate, tumor size, and RENAL nephrometry score. RESULTS After matching, 48 patients were allocated to each group. The mean age was 55 years, and the mean preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 68-69 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean tumor size was 30-31 mm. The RP group had a shorter operative time (124 vs. 151 min, p = 0.0002), shorter console time (74 vs. 110 min, p \u003C 0.0001), shorter warm ischemic time (14 vs. 17 min, p = 0.0343), lower estimated blood loss (EBL) (33 vs. 52 ml, p = 0.0002), and shorter postoperative length of hospital stay (PLOS) (3.3 vs. 4.0 days, p \u003C 0.0001) than the TP group. The change in eGFR, incidence rate of perioperative complication, and positive surgical margin rate did not significantly differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION RP had better surgical outcomes, including shorter operative time, lower EBL, and shorter PLOS for lateral renal tumors, which may suggest that RP is the optimal approach for selected lateral renal tumors.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takagi, Toshio; Yoshida, Kazuhiko; Kondo, Tsunenori; Kobayashi, Hirohito; Iizuka, Junpei; Okumi, Masayoshi; Ishida, Hideki; Tanabe, Kazunari","journal":"Journal of robotic surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-020-01086-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32358741/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lateral tumors","shorter PLOS","shorter operative time","selected lateral renal tumors","RP group","RENAL nephrometry score","shorter console time","shorter warm ischemic time","patients","CONCLUSION RP","TP group","mean preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate","surgical outcomes","mean age","propensity score matching","mean tumor size","positive surgical margin rate","shorter postoperative length of hospital","lower EBL","eGFR","RAPN","American Society of Anesthesiologists score","incidence rate of perioperative complication","lower estimated blood loss","sex","body mass index","robot","optimal approach","laparoscopic partial nephrectomy","approaches","years","transperitoneal","factors","effects of selection bias","following variables","study","change","METHODS","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","days","total","analysis","m2","groups"],"language":"en"},

Studies suggest that there are many differences between men and women in the immune response to CoV-19 infection and inflammatory diseases. Women, compared to men, are less susceptible to viral infections based on a different innate immunity, steroid hormones and factors related to sex chromosomes. The presence of two X chromosomes in women emphasize the immune system even if one is inactive. The immune regulatory genes encoded by X chromosome in female gender causes lower viral load levels, and less inflammation than in man, while CD4\u002B T cells are higher with better immune response. In addition, women generally produce higher levels of antibodies which remain in the circulation longer. The levels of activation of the immune cells are higher in women than in men, and it is correlated with the trigger of TLR7 and the production of IFN. TLR7 is higher in women than in men and its biallelic expression leads to higher immune responses and increases the resistance to viral infections. TLR7 is expressed in innate immune cells which recognizes single strand RNA virus by promoting the production of antibodies against the virus and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1 family members. Moreover, in women the production of inflammatory IL-6 after viral infection is lower than in males and is often correlated with a better longevity. In addition, on the X chromosome there are loci that code for the genes involved in the regulation of immune cells such as FOXP3, and transcription factor for Treg involved in virus pathogenesis. The X chromosome influences the immune system by acting on many other proteins, including TLR8, CD40L and CXCR3 which can be over-expressed in women, and influence the response to viral infections and vaccinations. However, the biallelic expression of the X-linked genes can promote harmful autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Cardiovascular diseases are more frequent in males and subjects without cardiovascular dysfunctions infected by CoV-19 have a better prognosis. ACE2 is a receptor for CoV-19 and protects lung damage. CoV-19 infection and the virus\u0027s Spike protein inhibit the expression of ACE2, abolishing its protective function. Inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI) are used to stem the devastating effects of CoV-19, to increase the number of CD3 and CD8 T cells and to reduce the viral load and IL-6 levels that control CoV-19 replication via NF-\uF06BB, but these effects are still under study. It is hoped that certain drugs, such as CoV-19 receptor blockers, anti-inflammatories (against rheumatic diseases), monoclonal antibodies, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6, the remdesevir drug (analogue adenosine, effective against ebola), hydroxychloroquine (for the treatment of malaria) and vaccines, will open up new strategies and new therapeutic ways to combat this terrible virus.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Conti, P; Younes, A","journal":"Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23812/editorial-conti-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253888/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["women","immune system","innate immune cells","higher immune responses","regulation of immune cells","better immune response","SARS-CoV","viral infections","immune regulatory genes","production of inflammatory IL","anti-IL","higher levels of antibodies","devastating effects of CoV","inflammatory diseases","X-linked genes","inflammatory responses","terrible virus","virus pathogenesis","pathogenic virus","production of antibodies","CD8 T cells","female gender causes lower viral load levels","levels of activation","expression of ACE2","Cardiovascular diseases","biallelic expression leads","single strand RNA virus","rheumatic diseases","males","monoclonal antibodies","production of IFN","trigger of TLR7","better prognosis","addition","better longevity","generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines","new strategies","sex chromosomes","cardiovascular dysfunctions","receptor blockers","different innate immunity","new therapeutic ways","serious problems","steroid hormones","factors","FOXP3","acute respiratory distress syndrome","remdesevir drug","analogue adenosine","Treg","transcription factor","subjects","virus\u0027s Spike protein","anti-inflammatories","inflammation","resistance","CD40L","hydroxychloroquine","COVID","ebola","vaccines","coronavirus","number of CD3","man","replication","loci","code","global health","NF-\uF06BB","angiotensin","enzyme","TLR8","CXCR3","treatment of malaria","proteins","differences","vaccinations","presence","protective function","Inhibitors","ACEI","family members","lung damage","certain drugs","Studies","study","circulation"],"language":"en"},

Overall, 12 side vessels were covered during retreatment, whereof 10 (83.3%) remained patent until mid-term follow-up. There were no further technical or symptomatic complications and no treatment-related morbidity. Angiographic follow-up (median, 17 months) showed improved aneurysm occlusion in all patients. Complete or near-complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 11 aneurysms (91.7%). CONCLUSION Required retreatment after failed flow-diversion therapy can be performed with adequate safety and efficacy by placement of additional flow-diverter stents.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goertz, Lukas; Hesse, Nina; Liebig, Thomas; Ahmad, Wael; Abdullayev, Nuran; Krischek, Boris; Kabbasch, Christoph; Dorn, Franziska","journal":"Neuroradiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02389-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32140782/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["flow-diversion therapy","flow-diverter implantation","Angiographic follow-up","RESULTS Retreatment","placement of additional flow-diverter stents","persistent intracranial aneurysms","cases","patients","angiographic outcomes","complete aneurysm occlusion","median size","improved aneurysm occlusion","median patient age","symptomatic complications","Treatment strategies","mid-term follow-up","treatment-related morbidity","months","management of residual","adequate safety","efficacy","PURPOSE","internal carotid artery","METHODS","years","multicentric study","patent","posterior circulation","CONCLUSION","vessels","literature"],"language":"en"},

SELECTION CRITERIA Papers reporting cases of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 who delivered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The following was extracted: author; country; number of women; study design; gestational age at delivery; selected clinical maternal data; mode of delivery; selected neonatal outcomes. MAIN RESULTS In the 13 studies included, vaginal delivery was reported in 6 cases (9.4%; 95% CI, 3.5-19.3). Indication for cesarean delivery was worsening of maternal conditions in 31 cases (48.4%; 95% CI, 35.8-61.3). Two newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR assay were reported. In three neonates, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels were elevated but the RT-PCR test was negative. CONCLUSIONS The rate of vertical or peripartum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is low, if any, for cesarean delivery; no data are available for vaginal delivery. Low frequency of spontaneous preterm birth and general favorable immediate neonatal outcome are reassuring.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parazzini, Fabio; Bortolus, Renata; Mauri, Paola Agnese; Favilli, Alessandro; Gerli, Sandro; Ferrazzi, Enrico","journal":"International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271947/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjszNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","mode of delivery","cesarean delivery","vaginal delivery","peripartum transmission of SARS","cases of women","pregnant women","number of women","clinical maternal data","neonatal outcomes","DATA COLLECTION","CI","RT-PCR test","general favorable immediate neonatal outcome","clinical series","rate of vertical","available information","maternal conditions","real-time RT-PCR assay","following key words","Low frequency of spontaneous preterm birth","study design","gestational age","author","country","COVID","SEARCH STRATEGY Combination","case reports","BACKGROUND","pregnancy","ANALYSIS","studies","IgM levels","SELECTION CRITERIA Papers","IgG","Embase","PubMed databases","CONCLUSIONS","newborns","MAIN RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","Indication","neonates"],"language":"en"},

The hypothesis of the present study is that attending lessons in Greek traditional dance is an effective method for managing anxiety and stress in patients diagnosed with cancer of any type both during and after treatment. The study was conducted on 300 cancer patients (150 experimental subjects, 150 controls) selected by Attica hospitals and nonprofit cancer patients\u0027 organizations. Each patient in the experimental group attended an 8-week Greek traditional dance lesson program. Lessons were held twice per week, lasting 60 min each. A similar group of cancer patients not participating in any organized physical activity during the same time period served as a control group. Data were collected using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (Dass-21) questionnaire and subjected to reliability analysis (Cronbach\u0027s alpha) and deviation-dependent analysis (one-way repeated). Both stress and anxiety values decreased significantly in the experimental group (stress value: initial mean = 16.27, second mean = 2.58, final mean = 6.77, p \u003C 0.001; anxiety value: initial mean = 15.59, second mean = 2.81, final mean = 5.35, p \u003C 0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS We followed the Cochrane rapid review methodology. The search strategy encompasses one academic database and pre-prints until April 1, 2020. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by one investigator. The full text review was divided among three researchers. The results were synthesized in a narrative way. RESULTS 713 manuscripts were identified, of which 21 met the inclusion criteria. Of six systematic reviews, four found no reduction in the probability of transmission. Experimental home studies found no differences in the probability of contagion associated with the use of mouth masks. Only one modeling study estimated a 20% reduction in the incidence of acute respiratory disease, assuming that 10 to 50% of the population use the surgical masks correctly.

This study compared delayed wound healing rates and reoperations between 2 increasingly popular dressings: a silver-impregnated occlusive (standard) dressing and a 2-octyl cyanoacrylate adhesive with polyester mesh. Methods This retrospective cohort study reviewed 431 consecutive THAs performed by 2 surgeons between January 2017 and May 2019. One hundred and eight were excluded for not using standard or mesh dressings. A final 323 cases were separated into 2 cohorts: mesh (n = 186) and standard dressings (n = 137). Standard dressings were removed at 1 week. Mesh persisted until nonadherent, approximately 3-4 weeks. The surgeon assessed delayed wound healing at the 2-week postoperative visit. Secondary outcomes include deep infection and return to the operating room for a wound-related diagnosis. Differences were determined using the chi-square test. Results There were no demographic, comorbidity, or surgical differences between groups. There were 22 total cases of delayed wound healing with 7 (3.8%) in the mesh group and 15 (10.9%) in the standard dressing group (P = .01). There were no significant differences in reoperations (2 [1.1%] vs 2 [1.5%], P = .76) or deep infections (2 [1.1%] vs 1 [0.7%], P = .75). Conclusions Mesh dressings are a safe and reliable dressing type for THA and were associated with a decrease in early wound healing complications when compared with standard, silver-impregnated occlusive dressings in this retrospective series. The mesh tension sharing properties and longer duration of occlusive protection may explain this difference.

Previous study reported a higher severe status rate and mortality rate in male patients in China. However, the reason underlying this difference has not been reported. Convalescent plasma containing high level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody has been used in clinical therapy and achieved good effects in China. In this study, to compare the differences of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female patients, a total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Serum of these patients were collected during hospitalization and detected for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Our data showed that the concentration of IgG antibody in mild, general and recovering patients showed no difference between male and female patients. In severe status, compared with male patients, there were more female patients having a relatively high concentration of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in disease early phase. Our study identified a discrepancy in SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level in male and female patients, which may be a potential cause leading to different outcome of COVID-19 between sex.

Additionally, overexpressed hDPP4 is associated with neurological complications and breeding difficulties in some transgenic mice, resulting in impeding further studies. Here, we generated stable hDPP4-transgenic mice that were sufficiently susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. The transgenic mice showed weight loss, decreased pulmonary function, and increased mortality with minimal perturbation of overexpressed hDPP4 after MERS-CoV infection. In addition, we observed histopathological signs indicative of progressive pulmonary fibrosis, including thickened alveolar septa, infiltration of inflammatory monocytes, and macrophage polarization as well as elevated expression of profibrotic molecules and acute inflammatory response in the lung of MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-transgenic mice. Collectively, we suggest that this hDPP4-transgenic mouse is useful to enable understanding of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection and for antiviral research and vaccine development against the virus.","publish_time":"2019-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ju; Yang, Ye Lin; Jeong, Yongsu; Jang, Yong-Suk","journal":"Journal of microbiology and biotechnology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1910.10055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31838832/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","hDPP4-transgenic mouse","CoV-infected hDPP4-transgenic mice","lung of MERS","pathogenesis of MERS","stable hDPP4-transgenic mice","diverse transgenic mouse models","minimal perturbation of overexpressed hDPP4","mouse DPP4","severe acute respiratory failure","acute inflammatory response","pulmonary function","increased mortality","lower respiratory airway of humans","diverse methods","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","histopathological signs indicative of progressive pulmonary fibrosis","infiltration of inflammatory monocytes","moderate clinical signs","thickened alveolar septa","elevated expression of profibrotic molecules","antiviral research","macrophage polarization","neurological complications","breeding difficulties","weight loss","understanding","vaccine development","mDPP4","receptor","addition","human dipeptidyl peptidase","studies"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of this review were to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of neonatal synthetic vitamin A supplementation, dextrose gel and probiotic supplementation for prevention of morbidity and mortality during infancy in low and middle-income countries. Methods: We included randomized trials. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. We conducted electronic searches on multiple databases. Data were meta-analyzed to obtain relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Studies for vitamin A and Probiotics were analyzed separately. No studies were found for dextrose gel supplementation during neonatal period. The overall rating of evidence was determined by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: Sixteen studies assessed the effect of vitamin A supplementation during the neonatal period. Based on pooled data from community-based studies only, there was no significant effect of vitamin A on all-cause mortality at age 1 month (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90, 1.08), 6 months (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.89-1.08) and 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94, 1.14) but increased risk of bulging fontanelle (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12, 2.09). The overall quality of evidence was high for the above outcomes. Thirty-three studies assessed the effect of probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period and were mostly conducted in the hospital setting. Probiotics reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66, 0.96), necrotizing enterocolitis (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35, 0.59) and neonatal sepsis (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70, 0.86). The grade ratings for the above three outcomes were high. Conclusions: Vitamin A supplementation during the neonatal period does not reduce all-cause neonatal or infant mortality in low and middle-income countries in the community setting. Probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period seems to reduce all-cause mortality, NEC, and sepsis in babies born low birth weight and/or preterm in the hospital setting.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imdad, Aamer; Rehman, Faseeha; Davis, Evan; Attia, Suzanna; Ranjit, Deepika; Surin, Gamael Saint; Lawler, Sarah; Smith, Abigail; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12030791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32192165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Probiotics","NEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RR","CI","neonatal period","all-cause neonatal","risk of all-cause mortality","neonatal sepsis","effect of probiotic supplementation","infant mortality","effectiveness of neonatal synthetic vitamin","dextrose gel supplementation","significant effect of vitamin","community-based studies","risk factor","relative risk","community setting","hospital setting","middle-income countries","outcomes","Probiotics","months","increased risk of bulging fontanelle","low birth weight","overall rating of evidence","overall quality of evidence","prevention of morbidity","long-term morbidity","pooled data","grade ratings","newborn","infancy","Evaluation","Development","babies","efficacy","Grading of Recommendations Assessment","age","Suboptimal nutritional status","Primary outcome","necrotizing enterocolitis","electronic searches","multiple databases","Background","confidence interval","Methods","randomized trials","review","approach","Results","Conclusions","objectives"],"language":"en"},

In the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 has counter-regulatory functions against the classical effector peptide angiotensin II, for example in blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular remodeling. However, ACE2 provides an initially unexpected interesting link between virology and cardiovascular medicine. That is, ACE2 represents the binding receptor for the cellular uptake of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Thus, ACE2 is relevant for COVID-19. In this context, it was suspected that therapy with RAS blockers might promote transmission and complications of COVID-19 by upregulation of ACE2 expression. The aim of this short review is, to describe the link between the RAS, particularly ACE2, and COVID-19.

Indeed, neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have already been reported and highlight the relevance of considering the neurological impact of coronavirus from a translational perspective. Animal models of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by structurally similar coronaviruses during the 2002 and 2012 epidemics, have provided valuable data on nervous system involvement by coronaviruses and the potential for CNS spread of SARS-CoV-2. One key finding that may unify these pathogens is that all require angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The CoV spike glycoprotein, by which SARS_CoV-2 binds to cell membranes, binds ACE2 with a higher affinity compared to SARS-CoV. The expression of this receptor in neurons and endothelial cells hints that SARS-CoV-2 may have higher neuroinvasive potential compared to previous coronaviruses. Yet, how such invasiveness might contribute to respiratory failure or cause direct neurological damage remains to be determined. Both direct and indirect mechanisms may be of relevance. Clinical heterogeneity potentially driven by differential host immune-mediated responses will require extensive investigation. Development of disease models to anticipate emerging neurological complications and to explore mechanisms of direct or immune-mediated pathogenicity in the short- and medium- term is therefore of great importance.

This new disease, due to its large diffusion, may significantly hamper the prognosis of other pathologies, such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) because of (a) a possible direct negative impact and (b) shortage of first response medical resources and increased delays to reperfusion. We report the case of a 68-year-old man admitted for anterior STEMI and asymptomatic COVID-19. Due to extended transportation delays to a cathlab, he received intravenous fibrinolytic therapy, which failed. Reperfusion was achieved with rescue coronary angioplasty, but the patient experienced two episodes of acute stent thrombosis at 2- and 36-hr following admission and despite optimal medical therapy. He finally died because of cardiogenic shock. This raises concerns about a possible increase in platelet aggregability associated with COVID-19 leading to an increased risk of stent thrombosis, particularly in the context of STEMI. This pleads for the promotion of primary coronary angioplasty as the first-choice revascularization technique in this population and the use of new generation P2Y12 inhibitors. In addition, the use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors may be considered in every STEMI patient with COVID-19 to prevent the risk of acute stent thrombosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lacour, Thibaud; Semaan, Carl; Genet, Thibaud; Ivanes, Fabrice","journal":"Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography \u0026 Interventions","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.28948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352633/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["STEMI patient","increased risk of stent thrombosis","anterior STEMI","risk of acute stent thrombosis","asymptomatic COVID","context of STEMI","management of COVID","episodes of acute stent thrombosis","increased delays","reperfusion","response medical resources","optimal medical therapy","rescue coronary angioplasty","use of new generation P2Y12 inhibitors","use of GPIIb","possible increase","promotion of primary coronary angioplasty","IIIa inhibitors","new disease","extended transportation delays","Important health resources","intravenous fibrinolytic therapy","possible direct negative impact","cathlab","population","shortage","ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction","platelet aggregability","year-old man","choice revascularization technique","admission","pathologies","large diffusion","concerns","prognosis","case","addition","cardiogenic shock"],"language":"en"},

This progressive step is superimposable to what observed in surgery for edge-to-edge surgery (Alfieri\u0027s technique). Moreover, the results of clinical studies on the treatment of patients with high surgical risk and functional mitral insufficiency have confirmed that the main goal to be achieved for improving clinical outcomes of patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is the reduction of MR itself. The MitraClip should therefore be considered as a tool to achieve this goal in addition to medical therapy. Nowadays, evaluation of patient\u0027s candidacy to MitraClip procedure, discussed in local Heart Team, must take into account not only the clinical features of patients but even the experience of the operators and the volume of the centre, which are mostly related to the probability to achieve good procedural results.

Cognitive symptoms are also present in other psychiatric disorders, are a hallmark of aging, and define several late-life disorders, including Alzheimer\u0027s disease. This pervasive occurrence suggests either a non-specific outcome of a diseased brain, or a shared underlying pathology contributing to this symptom dimension. Recent findings suggest a role for altered GABAergic inhibition in cognitive symptoms. Cellular, molecular and biochemical studies in human subjects report changes affecting the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) system, specifically somatostatin-expressing (SST\u002B) GABAergic interneurons, across brain disorders and during aging. SST\u002B neurons gate excitatory input onto pyramidal neurons within cortical microcircuits. Experimentally reducing the function of these neurons affects excitatory signal-to-noise ratio, reduces synchronized cellular and neural activity, and leads to cognitive dysfunctions. Conversely, augmenting SST\u002B cell post-synaptic \u03B15-GABA-A receptor activity has pro-cognitive efficacy in stress and aging models. Together, this suggests that reduced signaling of the SST\u002B neuron/\u03B15-GABA-A receptor pathway contributes to cognitive dysfunctions, and that it represents a novel therapeutic target for remediating mood and cognitive symptoms in depression, other psychiatric disorders and during aging.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pr\u00E9vot, Thomas; Sibille, Etienne","journal":"Molecular psychiatry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-0727-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cognitive symptoms","Cognitive dysfunctions","SST","pro-cognitive efficacy","brain disorders","psychiatric disorders","aging models","hallmark of aging","receptor activity","pyramidal neurons","late-life disorders","neurons gate excitatory input","cell post-synaptic \u03B15-GABA","excitatory signal","neural activity","receptor pathway","diseased brain","GABAergic inhibition","GABAergic interneurons","depressive episodes","recurrent episodes","human subjects report changes","biochemical studies","remediating mood","gamma-amino butyric acid","stress","depression","noise ratio","shared underlying pathology","non-specific outcome","learning","system","novel therapeutic target","role","impaired attention","cortical microcircuits","memory","problem","symptom dimension","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","pervasive occurrence","relapse","remission","somatostatin","Recent findings","current antidepressants","medications"],"language":"en"},

The infection due to this virus spread exponentially throughout China and then spread across \u003E205 nations, including the United States (US). Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies are routinely performed in the US and globally. Previous reports of isolated infection outbreaks were reported with endoscopes acting as potential vectors. While multidrug-resistant organisms have been reported to be spread by endoscopes, few cases of viruses such as Hepatitis B and C are noted in the literature. COVID-19 predominately spread by droplet transmission, although recent evidence showed that shedding in feces and feco-oral transmission could also be possible. It is unclear if COVID-19 could be transmitted by endoscopes, but it could theoretically happen due to contact with mucous membranes and body fluids. GI endoscopies involve close contact with oral and colonic contents exposing endoscopy staff to respiratory and oropharyngeal secretions. This can increase the risk of contamination and contribute to virus transmission. Given these risks, all major GI societies have called for rescheduling elective non-urgent procedures and perform only emergent or urgent based on the clinical need. Furthermore, pre-screening of all individuals prior to endoscopy is recommended. This article focuses on the risk of COVID-19 transmission by GI shedding, the potential role of endoscopes as a vector of this novel virus including transmission during endoscopies and prevention strategies including deferral of elective non-urgent endoscopy procedures.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perisetti, Abhilash; Gajendran, Mahesh; Boregowda, Umesha; Bansal, Pardeep; Goyal, Hemant","journal":"Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/den.13693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281689/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GI"],"locations":["China","United States"],"keyphrases":["virus transmission","GI endoscopies","GI shedding","droplet transmission","risk of COVID","feco-oral transmission","coronavirus disease","potential role of endoscopes","elective non-urgent procedures","deferral of elective non-urgent endoscopy procedures","endoscopy staff","major GI societies","novel virus","new coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","close contact","potential vectors","risk of contamination","Wuhan city of China","Previous reports of isolated infection outbreaks","colonic contents","prevention strategies","feces","recent evidence","cases of viruses","Hepatitis B","mucous membranes","body fluids","oropharyngeal secretions","clinical need","SARS-CoV","United States","risks","multidrug-resistant organisms","nations","article","literature","individuals"],"language":"en"},

International resuscitation guidelines state that extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) may have a role in selected patients suffering refractory cardiac arrest. Identifying these patients is challenging. This project systematically reviewed the evidence comparing the outcomes of ECPR over conventional-CPR (CCPR), before examining resuscitation-specific parameters to assess which patients might benefit from ECPR. Method Literature searches of studies comparing ECPR to CCPR and the clinical parameters of survivors of ECPR were performed. The primary outcome examined was survival at hospital discharge or 30 days. A secondary analysis examined the resuscitation parameters that may be associated with survival in patients who receive ECPR (no-flow and low-flow intervals, bystander-CPR, initial shockable cardiac rhythm, and witnessed cardiac arrest). Results Seventeen of 948 examined studies were included. ECPR demonstrated improved survival (OR 0.40 (0.27-0.60)) and a better neurological outcome (OR 0.10 (0.04-0.27)) over CCPR during literature review and meta-analysis. Characteristics that were associated with improved survival in patients receiving ECPR included an initial shockable rhythm and a shorter low-flow time. Shorter no-flow, the presence of bystander-CPR and witnessed arrests were not characteristics that were associated with improved survival following meta-analysis, although the quality of input data was low. All data were non-randomised, and hence the potential for bias is high. Conclusion ECPR is a sophisticated treatment option which may improve outcomes in a selected patient population in refractory cardiac arrest.

Based on the structural information of the complex of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we analyzed the affinity to S protein of the 20 key residues in ACE2 from mammal, bird, turtle and snake. Several ACE2 proteins from Primates, Bovidae, Cricetidae and Cetacea maintained the majority of key residues in ACE2 for associating with SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

Four mRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 5 lncRNAs were analyzed by quantitative PCR. RNA levels in 30 healthy individuals were used as controls. RNA expression data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, and the primary end point was progression-free survival. Clinical factors were included in the multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Levels of 2 miRNAs, miR-375 and miR-3687, and 1 lncRNA, N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase like 2 antisense RNA 2 (NAALADL2-AS2), were more than 2-fold higher in patients with mCRPC compared with healthy volunteers. Patients with higher levels of miR-375 or miR-3687 showed a shorter time to progression. Patients with higher levels of NAALADL2-AS2 showed a longer time to progression. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, higher miR-375, miR-3687 and serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations were shown to be independent predictors for shorter time to progression. CONCLUSIONS We identified miR-3687 as a novel prognostic marker for response in patients with CRPC treated with enzalutamide, and we confirmed the prognostic value of miR-375.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benoist, Guillemette E; van Oort, Inge M; Boerrigter, Emmy; Verhaegh, Gerald W; van Hooij, Onno; Groen, Levi; Smit, Frank; de Mol, Pieter; Hamberg, Paul; Dezentj\u00E9, Vincent O; Mehra, Niven; Gerritsen, Winald; Somford, Diederik M; van Erp, Nielka P H; Schalken, Jack A","journal":"Clinical chemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408351/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["higher miR","higher levels of miR","prognostic value of miR","RNA levels","higher levels of NAALADL2","mCRPC","miRNAs","liquid biopsies of patients","multivariable Cox regression analysis","shorter time","RESULTS Levels","Cox regression analyses","potential biomarkers","NAALADL2-AS2","antisense RNA","lncRNAs","progression-free survival","noncoding RNAs","longer time","messenger RNAs","response evaluation","mRNAs","enzalutamide","therapy","promising source of biomarkers","RNA expression data","treatment options","treatment selection","healthy individuals","healthy volunteers","novel prognostic marker","metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer","serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations","primary end point","Kaplan-Meier","acidic dipeptidase","independent predictors","N-acetylated alpha","microRNAs","prospective multicenter observational study","Clinical factors","baseline","months","quantitative PCR","BACKGROUND","controls","blood","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Although, SARS-Cov-2 primarily causes lung infection through binding of ACE2 receptors present on the alveolar epithelial cells, yet it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the faeces of infected patients. Interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine also express ACE2 receptors. Role of the gut microbiota in influencing lung diseases has been well articulated. It is also known that respiratory virus infection causes perturbations in the gut microbiota. Diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota which can influence immunity. Gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and Covid-19 has been mainly fatal in elderly patients which again points to the role the gut microbiota may play in this disease. Improving gut microbiota profile by personalized nutrition and supplementation known to improve immunity can be one of the prophylactic ways by which the impact of this disease can be minimized in old people and immune-compromised patients. More trials may be initiated to see the effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food including prebiotics/probiotics along with current therapies.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhar, Debojyoti; Mohanty, Abhishek","journal":"Virus research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405119/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gut microbiota profile","Gut microbiota diversity","SARS-CoV","lung infection","important role","lung diseases","elderly patients","Covid","immunity","express ACE2 receptors","alveolar epithelial cells","intestinal epithelial cells","immune-compromised patients","faeces of infected patients","personalized nutrition","binding of ACE2 receptors present","old people","old age","effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food","respiratory virus infection","understanding of infectious diseases","prebiotics","probiotics","enterocytes","points","small intestine","genetics","perturbations","environmental factors","implications","world","Diet","current therapies","impact","major pandemic","RNA","prophylactic ways","trials"],"language":"en"},

At the center of the crisis is the highly infectious and deadly SARS-CoV-2, which has altered everything from individual daily lives to the global economy and our collective consciousness. Aside from the pulmonary manifestations of disease, there are likely to be several electrophysiologic (EP) sequelae of COVID-19 infection and its treatment, due to consequences of myocarditis and the use of QT-prolonging drugs. Most crucially, the surge in COVID-19 positive patients that have already overwhelmed the New York City hospital system requires conservation of hospital resources including personal protective equipment (PPE), reassignment of personnel, and reorganization of institutions, including the EP laboratory. In this proposal, we detail the specific protocol changes that our EP department has adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, including performance of only urgent/emergent procedures, afterhours/7-day per week laboratory operation, single attending-only cases to preserve PPE, appropriate use of PPE, telemedicine and video chat follow-up appointments, and daily conferences to collectively manage the clinical and ethical dilemmas to come. We discuss also discuss how we perform EP procedures on presumed COVID positive and COVID tested positive patients in order to highlight issues that others in the EP community may soon face in their own institution as the virus continues to spread nationally and internationally.

However, human-induced habitat modification processes threaten the ecological structure of this river basin. Among the GBMK\u0027s diverse flora and fauna of this freshwater ecosystem, the endemic Ganges River dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica; GRD) is one of the most charismatic species in this freshwater ecosystem. Though a \u003E50% population size reduction has occurred since 1957, researchers and decision-makers often overlook the persistence (or evolutionary potential) of this species in the highly fragmented GBMK. We define the evolutionary potential as the ability of species/populations to adapt in a changing environment by maintaining their genetic diversity. Here, we review how evolutionary trap mechanisms affect the dynamics and viability of the GRD (hereafter Ganges dolphin) populations after rapid declines in their population size and distribution. We detected six potential trap mechanisms that might affect the Ganges dolphin populations discretely or in combination: (a) habitat modification; (b) occurrence of finite and geographically restricted local populations; (c) ratio of effective to estimate population size; (d) increasing risk of inbreeding depression in genetically isolated groups; (e) at-risk behavioral attributes; and (f) direct fisheries-dolphin interactions. Because evolutionary traps appear most significant during low water season, they adversely affect demographic parameters, which reduce evolutionary potential. These traps have already caused local extirpation events; therefore, we recommend translocation among populations, including restoring and preserving essential habitats as immediate conservation strategies. Integrative evolutionary potential information based on demographic, genetic, and environmental data is still lacking. Thus, we identify gaps in the knowledge and suggest integrative approaches to understand the future of Ganges dolphins in South Asian waterways.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paudel, Shambhu; Koprowski, John L","journal":"Ecology and evolution","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32211183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GBMK"],"locations":["India","Ganges River"],"keyphrases":["Ganges dolphin populations","evolutionary traps","endemic Ganges River dolphin","Integrative evolutionary potential information","evolutionary trap mechanisms","Ganges-Brahmaputra","potential trap mechanisms","restricted local populations","future of Ganges dolphins","population size reduction","freshwater ecosystem","biodiverse river basins","GRD","ability of species","charismatic species","direct fisheries-dolphin interactions","Platanista gangetica gangetica","demographic parameters","integrative approaches","genetic diversity","fragmented GBMK","human-induced habitat modification processes","local extirpation events","ecological structure","rapid declines","isolated groups","Karnaphuli","essential habitats","occurrence of finite","at-risk behavioral attributes","risk of inbreeding depression","fauna","restoring","low water season","Nepal","ratio of effective","Meghna","viability","dynamics","combination","South Asian waterways","immediate conservation strategies","Bangladesh","GBMK\u0027s diverse flora","world\u0027s","India","changing environment","persistence","researchers","decision-makers","knowledge","environmental data","translocation","distribution","gaps"],"language":"en"},

The resulting high economic and environmental costs are further damaging societies worldwide. Herein, we reported a unique method for functionalizing commercially available surgical masks with outstanding self-cleaning and photothermal properties.

Under sunlight illumination, the surface temperature of the functional mask can quickly increase to over 80 \u00B0C, making the masks reusable after sunlight sterilization. In addition, this graphene-coated mask can be recycled directly for use in solar-driven desalination with outstanding salt-rejection performance for long-term use.

The importance of tetrastarch dose, however, is unknown. METHODS A retrospective observational study was performed in two trauma centres using data on type and amount of fluids (balanced crystalloids or tetrastarch) used for pre- and acute in-hospital shock management. We evaluate independent associations between the relative and absolute volumes of tetrastarch and 90-day survival time or the frequency of severe acute kidney failure (AKF). RESULTS We studied 271 patients who had sustained a severe blunt trauma injury (average predicted mortality according to the Revised Injury Severity Classification Score (RISC) 15.1 \u00B1 1.4% [mean, standard deviation]), and who had required more than 2 days of intensive care therapy. In all, 75.3% of patients had received tetrastarch with a crystalloid/colloid ratio of 2.93 \u00B1 2.60. The 90-day mortality was 11.1%, and 7.8% of the patients developed severe AKF. After adjusting for confounders, we found a U-shaped, nonlinear association between absolute or relative volumes of tetrastarch and survival time (p = 0.003 and 0.025, respectively). Optimal relative volumes of tetrastarch approximately ranged from 20 to 30% of total fluids.

It has impacted neurologists and other health care workers, not only in our professional lives but also through the fear and panic within our own families, colleagues, patients and their families, and even in the wider public. COVID-19 affects all sorts of individuals, but the elderly with underlying chronic conditions are particularly at risk of severe disease, or even death. Parkinson\u0027s disease (PD) shares a common profile as an age-dependent degenerative disorder, frequently associated with comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular diseases, so PD patients will almost certainly fall into the high-risk group. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the risk of COVID-19 in PD based on the susceptibility to severe disease, its impact on PD disease severity, potential long-term sequelae, and difficulties of PD management during this outbreak, where neurologists face various challenges on how we can maintain effective care for PD patients without exposing them, or ourselves, to the risk of infection. It is less than six months since the identification of the original COVID-19 case on New Year\u0027s Eve 2019, so it is still too early to fully understand the natural history of COVID-19 and the evidence on COVID-19-related PD is scant. Though the possibilities presented are speculative, they are theory-based, and supported by prior evidence from other neurotrophic viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Neurologists should be on high alert and vigilant for potential acute and chronic complications when encountering PD patients who are suspected of having COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhidayasiri, Roongroj; Virameteekul, Sasivimol; Kim, Jong-Min; Pal, Pramod Kr; Chung, Sun-Ju","journal":"Journal of movement disorders","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.14802/jmd.20042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344993/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Parkinson"],"organizations":["PD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PD patients","related PD","risk of COVID","PD disease severity","neurologists","original COVID","difficulties of PD management","risk of severe disease","natural history of COVID","Parkinson\u0027s disease","families","risk of infection","chronic complications","effective care","prior evidence","potential long-term sequelae","underlying chronic conditions","health care workers","impact","outbreak","elderly","case","high alert","common profile","age-dependent degenerative disorder","neurotrophic viruses","comorbidities","fear","New Year\u0027s Eve","colleagues","cardiovascular diseases","susceptibility","various challenges","panic","sorts of individuals","infectious disorders","identification","professional lives","SARS-CoV","months","review","death","high-risk group","possibilities","theory","aim"],"language":"en"},

We compared continuous Normothermic Ex Vivo Kidney Perfusion (NEVKP) with hypothermic anoxic machine perfusion (HAMP) and static cold storage (SCS) in a porcine kidney autotransplantation model. METHODS Porcine kidneys were exposed to 30min of warm ischemia and then reimplanted following either 16hr of either SCS, HAMP (LifePort 1.0) or NEVKP prior to autotransplantation (n=5 per group). The contralateral kidney was removed. Animals were followed for 8 days. RESULTS Grafts preserved by NEVKP demonstrated improved function with more rapid recovery compared to HAMP and SCS (mean peak serum creatinine: 3.66\u002B/-1.33mg/dl (postoperative day 1; POD1), 8.82\u002B/-3.17mg/dl (POD2), and 12.90\u002B/-2.19mg/dl (POD3), respectively). The NEVKP group demonstrated significantly increased creatinine clearance calculated on POD3 (63.6\u002B/-19.0ml/min) compared to HAMP (13.5\u002B/-10.3ml/min, p=0.001) and SCS (4.0\u002B/-2.6ml/min,p=0.001). Histopathologic injury scores on POD8 were lower in both perfused groups (NEVKP and HAMP, score: 1-1.5) compared to SCS (score: 1-3, p=0.3), without reaching statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS NEVKP storage significantly improved early kidney function compared to both cold preservation strategies, although HAMP also demonstrates improvement over SCS. NEVKP may represent a novel, superior preservation option for DCD renal grafts compared to conventional hypothermic methods.","publish_time":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Urbanellis, Peter; Hamar, Matyas; Kaths, J Moritz; Kollmann, Dagmar; Linares, Ivan; Mazilescu, Laura; Ganesh, Sujani; Wiebe, Aryn; Yip, Paul M; John, Rohan; Konvalinka, Ana; Mucsi, Istvan; Ghanekar, Anand; Bagli, Darius J; Robinson, Lisa A; Selzner, Markus","journal":"Transplantation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31815900/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DCD","Normothermic Ex Vivo Kidney Perfusion","HAMP","NEVKP","SCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HAMP","SCS","NEVKP group","CONCLUSIONS NEVKP storage","Kidney Perfusion","early kidney function","contralateral kidney","storage of DCD grafts","improved function","porcine kidney autotransplantation model","cold preservation strategies","kidney donor pool","DCD renal grafts","static cold storage","graft function","RESULTS Grafts","POD3","BACKGROUND Better preservation strategies","superior preservation option","conventional hypothermic methods","METHODS Porcine kidneys","hypothermic anoxic machine perfusion","increased creatinine clearance","peak serum creatinine","POD8","perfused groups","rapid recovery","novel","continuous Normothermic Ex","Histopathologic injury scores","LifePort","improvement","postoperative day","POD1","hr","warm ischemia","Animals","days","statistical significance","POD2"],"language":"en"},

Lesions confined to the mucosal layer can be curatively treated endoscopically. We build a computer-assisted detection system that can classify still images or video frames as normal or abnormal with high diagnostic accuracy. METHODS We present a new benchmark dataset containing 68K binary labelled frames extracted from 114 patient videos whose imaged areas have been resected and correlated to histopathology. Our novel convolutional network architecture solves the binary classification task and explains what features of the input domain drive the decision-making process of the network. RESULTS The proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 91.7% compared to the 94.7% achieved by a group of 12 senior clinicians. Our novel network architecture produces deeply supervised activation heatmaps that suggest the network is looking at intrapapillary capillary loop patterns when predicting abnormality. CONCLUSION We believe that this dataset and baseline method may serve as a reference for future benchmarks on both video frame classification and explainability in the context of ESCN detection. A future work path of high clinical relevance is the extension of the classification to ESCN types.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-Peraza-Herrera, Luis C; Everson, Martin; Lovat, Laurence; Wang, Hsiu-Po; Wang, Wen Lun; Haidry, Rehan; Stoyanov, Danail; Ourselin, S\u00E9bastien; Vercauteren, Tom","journal":"International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02127-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32166574/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ESCN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel network architecture","novel convolutional network architecture","binary classification task","video frame classification","video frames","context of ESCN detection","ESCN types","binary labelled frames","high diagnostic accuracy","future benchmarks","average accuracy","detection system","proposed method","baseline method","future work path of high clinical relevance","new benchmark dataset","extension","explainability","patient videos","supervised activation heatmaps","features","reference","images","intrapapillary capillary loop patterns","squamous cell neoplasia","input domain","abnormality","oesophagus","PURPOSE","decision-making process","imaged areas","METHODS","Lesions","mucosal layer","group","senior clinicians","treatable condition","computer","CONCLUSION","histopathology"],"language":"en"},

While preemptive school closures can effectively reduce influenza transmission, they are disruptive and currently recommended only for pandemics. We assessed the feasibility of implementing other social distancing practices in K-12 schools as a first step in seeking an alternative to preemptive school closures. METHODS: We conducted 36 focus groups with education and public health officials across the United States. We identified and characterized themes and compared feasibility of practices by primary versus secondary school and region of the United States. RESULTS: Participants discussed 29 school practices (25 within-school practices implemented as part of the school day and 4 reduced-schedule practices that impact school hours). Participants reported that elementary schools commonly implement several within-school practices as part of routine operations such as homeroom stay, restriction of hall movement, and staggering of recess times. Because of routine implementation and limited use of individualized schedules within elementary schools, within-school practices were generally felt to be more feasible for elementary schools than secondary schools. Of reduced-schedule practices, shortening the school week and the school day was considered the most feasible; however, reduced-schedule practices were generally perceived to be less feasible than within-school practices for all grade levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that schools have many options to increase social distance other than closing. Future research should evaluate which of these seemingly feasible practices are effective in reducing influenza transmission in schools and surrounding communities.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uscher-Pines, Lori; Schwartz, Heather L.; Ahmed, Faruque; Zheteyeva, Yenlik; Tamargo Leschitz, Jennifer; Pillemer, Francesca; Faherty, Laura; Uzicanin, Amra","journal":"J Public Health Manag Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188044.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188044/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["school practices","school day","feasible practices","school week","feasibility of practices","preemptive school closures","reduced-schedule practices","elementary schools","school-based outbreaks","impact school hours","secondary schools","social distancing practices","influenza transmission","pandemic influenza","United States","Participants","routine implementation","routine operations","social distance","fuel community-wide transmission of seasonal","public health officials","limited use of individualized schedules","focus groups","education","homeroom","region","primary","restriction of hall movement","dense environments","options","alternative","surrounding communities","findings","step","characterized themes","grade levels","RESULTS","recess times","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","Future research","pandemics"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, they represent a neglected area in the field of health technology assessment (HTA) due to various methodological issues and their complex design that goes beyond clinical setting. The present study provides an environmental scan of HTA initiatives related to the assessment of PH technologies on a global level. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 85 HTA-related European and international societies, health bodies, and networks from September 2018 to January 2019. The questionnaire contained four sections and 18 questions regarding activities related to the evaluation of PH technologies, information on existing PH technologies, and methodologies of assessment as well as barriers and facilitators to reaching a decision and implementing a PH technology. Results: Among 52 survey responses, the majority of the respondents came from European countries (35%), followed by North American (27%), and South American (19%) countries. The main type of organizations covered by our survey included HTA agencies, public administrations, and research institutes. Seventy-one % of the institutions reported engagement in any aspect of HTA in the area of PH (N = 37). Among those, 81% evaluated less than 5 PH technologies from 2013 to 2018. The most common barriers for reaching a decision on PH technologies were lack of data, conflicting stakeholder priorities, and methodological issues. A total of 76 PH interventions were reported, and most cited initiatives were related to chronic disease screening, prevention of infectious diseases, and maternal, prenatal, and neonatal screening. Conclusion: Our survey reported a rather limited involvement of HTA in the evaluation of PH technologies. In particular, an evaluation of behavioral and lifestyle interventions remains extremely rare. The implementation of collaborative HTA approaches in the setting of PH practice and policy needs to be prioritized and further strengthened. Moreover, ensuring reliable data structures and consolidation of HTA methods for the evaluation of PH technologies will be crucial for tackling the enormous burden of non-communicable diseases in societies.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stojanovic, Jovana; W\u00FCbbeler, Markus; Geis, Sebastian; Reviriego, Eva; Guti\u00E9rrez-Ibarluzea, I\u00F1aki; Lenoir-Wijnkoop, Irene","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/437615727e22b43f261cb24c737593b578ab6885.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188782.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188782/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evaluation of PH technologies","PH interventions","assessment of PH technologies","area of PH","PH technology","existing PH technologies","setting of PH practice","HTA-related European","HTA agencies","aspect of HTA","consolidation of HTA methods","limited involvement of HTA","environmental scan of HTA initiatives","implementation of collaborative HTA approaches","Public health","evaluation of behavioral","survey responses","cross-sectional survey","field of health technology assessment","health bodies","methodologies of assessment","decision","lifestyle interventions","European countries","various methodological issues","lack of data","international societies","public administrations","cited initiatives","neonatal screening","clinical setting","neglected area","common barriers","prevention of infectious diseases","chronic disease screening","reliable data structures","enormous burden of non-communicable diseases","conflicting stakeholder priorities","complex design","information","questions","respondents","majority","activities","sustainable healthcare services","research institutes","present study","global level","sections","main type of organizations","engagement","networks","facilitators","policy","Introduction","questionnaire","institutions","Results","total","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The effects of microbes on their environment can be beneficial or harmful or inapparent with regard to human measure or observation. The most significant effect of the microbes on earth is their ability to recycle the primary elements that make up all living systems, especially carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen (N). Primary production involves photosynthetic organisms which take up CO(2) from the atmosphere and convert it to organic (cellular) material. The process is also called CO(2) fixation, and it accounts for a very large portion of organic carbon available for synthesis of cell material. Decomposition or biodegradation results in the breakdown of complex organic materials to other forms of carbon that can be used by other organisms. There is no naturally occurring organic compound that cannot be degraded by some microbe, although some synthetic compounds such as Teflon, plastics, insecticides, and pesticides are broken down very slowly or not at all. Through the microbial metabolic processes of fermentation and respiration, organic molecules are eventually broken down to CO(2) which is returned to the atmosphere for continuous process of primary production. Biological nitrogen fixation is a process found only in some bacteria which remove N(2) from the atmosphere and converts it to ammonia (NH(3)), for use by the plants and animals. Nitrogen fixation also results in replenishment of soil nitrogen removed by agricultural processes. Thus along with all these benefits, microbes greatly contribute in maintaining sustainability of environment. This chapter mainly focuses on beneficial and harmful impacts of microbes on environment and their role to maintain quality, health, and sustainability of environment.","publish_time":"2016-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Ankit; Gupta, Rasna; Singh, Ram Lakhan","journal":"Principles and Applications of Environmental Biotechnology for a Sustainable Future","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8007c6342f502c6224413b8fa264892072bbcc7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189961.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CO","Teflon"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sustainability of environment","organic molecules","organic compound","effects of microbes","atmosphere","harmful impacts of microbes","Biological nitrogen fixation","continuous process of primary production","large portion of organic carbon available","breakdown of complex organic materials","forms of carbon","replenishment of soil nitrogen","primary elements","agricultural processes","biodegradation results","photosynthetic organisms","synthesis of cell material","microbial metabolic processes of fermentation","regard","respiration","plastics","inapparent","oxygen","human measure","living systems","synthetic compounds","Teflon","earth","quality","health","role","insecticides","observation","Decomposition","biosphere","significant effect","use","plants","animals","pesticides","ammonia","chapter","presence","bacteria","NH","benefits"],"language":"en"},

The vast majority or 60% of these deaths are in Asia. Practically, more than four billion people in Asia or about 60% of the world\u2019s population are at risk of getting rabies where an estimated 96% of documented human cases are from an infected dog bite. Canine-mediated rabies is one of the few communicable diseases that can possibly be eliminated by currently available vaccines and tools for veterinary and public health interventions. With a more comprehensive and integrated approach, it is expected that dog rabies will be eliminated in target areas, and there will be an eventual decline and disappearance of human rabies cases. The burden of rabies is primarily on human health but the disease control has to be focused on the animal source. The ultimate goal of a truly regional disease program is to control and eliminate dog-mediated rabies and protect and maintain rabies-free areas in Asia. Current regional efforts aim to strengthen the intercountry coordination, and technical and institutional capacities to manage dog rabies elimination programs. The regional and national implementation efforts provide strategic direction and cooperation to ensure successful implementation of rabies control measures and eventual elimination. The focus areas include human rabies prevention through pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, mass dog vaccination, surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory diagnostic capability, public awareness and risk communication, legislation, dog population management, and establishment and protection of rabies-free zones/areas. Existing mechanisms for implementation, when applied, give emphasis on One Health collaborations.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miranda, Mary Elizabeth G.; Miranda, Noel Lee J.","journal":"Rabies and Rabies Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd151026d84a6c0ae4153bcfe89c19af68733c92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196719.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["protection of rabies","dog-mediated rabies","burden of rabies","human rabies deaths","human rabies prevention","rabies-free areas","dog rabies elimination programs","Canine-mediated rabies","disappearance of human rabies cases","successful implementation of rabies control measures","human health","Asia","dog population management","mass dog vaccination","infected dog bite","documented human cases","focus areas","disease control","target areas","national implementation efforts","public health interventions","eventual elimination","Current regional efforts","regional disease program","Health collaborations","public awareness","risk communication","eventual decline","world\u2019s population","free zones","surveillance","epidemiology","postexposure prophylaxis","laboratory diagnostic capability","strategic direction","legislation","institutional capacities","cooperation","tools","establishment","intercountry coordination","available vaccines","ultimate goal","emphasis","integrated approach","Existing mechanisms","Africa","vast majority","communicable diseases","animal source","people"],"language":"en"},

Integer Linear Programming is the most widely-used such general-purpose solution method. It is successful in a wide range of problems. However, there are some problems in computational biology where integer linear programming has had only limited success. In this paper, we explore an alternate, general-purpose solution method: SAT-solving, i.e., constructing Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) that encode a problem instance, and using a SAT-solver to determine if the CNF formula is satisfiable or not. In three hard problems examined, we were very surprised to find the SAT-solving approach was dramatically better than the ILP approach in two problems; and a little slower, but more robust, in the third problem. We also re-examined and confirmed an earlier result on a fourth problem, using current ILP and SAT-solvers. These results should encourage further efforts to exploit SAT-solving in computational biology.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brown, Hannah; Zuo, Lei; Gusfield, Dan","journal":"Algorithms for Computational Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26d0d89f55a03ae3837fe225fd2ed10f676e5805.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197060.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Linear Programming","CNF","ILP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wide range of problems","hard problems","specific problem","problem instance","general-purpose solution methods","Integer Linear Programming","computational biology","ILP approach","CNF formula","current ILP","conjunctive normal form","intricate algorithms","Boolean formulas","alternate","development of clever","limited success","solvers","earlier result","results","efforts","paper"],"language":"en"},

However, gene sequences often lack sufficient information to confidently distinguish between competing gene tree topologies. To overcome this limitation, the best gene tree reconstruction methods use a known species tree topology to guide the reconstruction of the gene tree. While such species-tree-aware gene tree reconstruction methods have been repeatedly shown to result in vastly more accurate gene trees, the most accurate of these methods often have prohibitively high computational costs. In this work, we introduce a highly computationally efficient and robust species-tree-aware method, named TreeSolve, for microbial gene tree reconstruction. TreeSolve works by collapsing weakly supported edges of the input gene tree, resulting in a non-binary gene tree, and then using new algorithms and techniques to optimally resolve the non-binary gene trees with respect to the given species tree in an appropriately and dynamically constrained search space. Using thousands of real and simulated gene trees, we demonstrate that TreeSolve significantly outperforms the best existing species-tree-aware methods for microbes in terms of accuracy, speed, or both. Crucially, TreeSolve also implicitly keeps track of multiple optimal gene tree reconstructions and can compute either a single best estimate of the gene tree or multiple distinct estimates. As we demonstrate, aggregating over multiple gene tree candidates helps distinguish between correct and incorrect parts of an error-corrected gene tree. Thus, TreeSolve not only enables rapid gene tree error-correction for large gene trees without compromising on accuracy, but also enables accounting of inference uncertainty.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kordi, Misagh; Bansal, Mukul S.","journal":"Algorithms for Computational Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1af7aa5711eccfd07c0cdba41fcfdece4f6e603e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197061.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197061/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["input gene tree","microbial gene tree reconstruction","multiple gene tree candidates","error-corrected gene tree","aware gene tree reconstruction methods","best gene tree reconstruction methods","competing gene tree topologies","gene sequences","robust species-tree","given species tree","rapid gene tree error-correction","accurate gene trees","large gene trees","simulated gene trees","track of multiple optimal gene tree reconstructions","best existing species-tree","non-binary gene trees","known species tree topology","TreeSolve","aware methods","single best estimate","multiple distinct estimates","terms of accuracy","respect","microbes","weakly supported edges","incorrect parts","important problem","sufficient information","techniques","thousands of real","limitation","new algorithms","speed","high computational costs","phylogenetics","accounting of inference uncertainty","constrained search space","work"],"language":"en"},

Comparisons using genome features like genes, gene order, and regulatory sequences are carried out with this purpose in mind. Genome rearrangements are mutational events that affect large extensions of the genome. They are responsible for creating extant species with conserved genes in different positions across genomes. Close species\u2014from an evolutionary point of view\u2014tend to have the same set of genes or share most of them. When we consider gene order to compare two genomes, it is possible to use a parsimony criterion to estimate how close the species are. We are interested in the shortest sequence of genome rearrangements capable of transforming one genome into the other, which is named rearrangement distance. Reversal is one of the most studied genome rearrangements events. This event acts in a segment of the genome, inverting the position and possibly the orientation of genes in it. When the genome has no gene repetition, a common approach is to map it as a permutation such that each element represents a conserved block. When genomes have replicated genes, this mapping is usually performed using strings. The number of replicas depends on the organisms being compared, but in many scenarios, it tends to be small. In this work, we study the reversal distance between genomes with duplicated genes considering that the orientation of genes is unknown. We present three heuristics that use techniques like genetic algorithms and local search. We conduct experiments using a database of simulated genomes and compared our results with other algorithms from the literature.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siqueira, Gabriel; Brito, Klairton Lima; Dias, Ulisses; Dias, Zanoni","journal":"Algorithms for Computational Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8270c976e88630695cf1f7c4f4473d4ccd5e520.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197074.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conserved genes","orientation of genes","genome features","duplicated genes","set of genes","studied genome rearrangements events","genomes of different organisms","shortest sequence of genome rearrangements capable","database of simulated genomes","gene order","Close species","extant species","gene repetition","reversal distance","different positions","mutational events","genetic algorithms","conserved block","rearrangement distance","techniques","large extensions","local search","goal","results","regulatory sequences","similarities","parsimony criterion","evolutionary point of view","element","heuristics","common approach","experiments","segment","mapping","Comparisons","event acts","purpose","comparative genomics","number of replicas","literature","work","scenarios","mind","permutation","strings"],"language":"en"},

However, many of these models have focused only on the (order of the) genes of a genome, disregarding other important elements in it.

We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected whole-body metabolism of the patients. In particular, malic acid of the TCA cycle and carbamoyl phosphate of urea cycle reveal the altered energy metabolism and hepatic dysfunction, respectively. It should be noted that carbamoyl phosphate is profoundly down-regulated in fatal patients compared with mild patients. And more importantly, guanosine monophosphate (GMP), which is mediated by not only GMP synthase but also CD39 and CD73, is significantly changed between healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients, as well as between the mild and fatal groups. In addition, the dyslipidaemia was observed in COVID-19 patients. Overall, the disturbed metabolic patterns have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19.

This requires careful effort in extracting relevant knowledge from HIN. However, existing models in this setting have the following shortcomings. Mainly, they are not end-to-end, which puts the burden on the system to first learn similarity or commuting matrix offline using some manually selected meta-paths before we train for the top-N recommendation objective. Further, they do not attentively extract user-specific information from HIN, which is essential for personalization. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end neural network model \u2013 GAMMA (Graph and Multi-view Memory Attention mechanism). We aim to replace the offline meta-path based similarity or commuting matrix computation with a graph attention mechanism. Besides, with different semantics of items in HIN, we propose a multi-view memory attention mechanism to learn more profound user-specific item views. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for top-N recommendation setting.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vijaikumar, M.; Shevade, Shirish; Narasimha Murty, M.","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f85cb40c72d03c2c683cb32ccaee3418ae925dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206146.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIN","N recommendation setting","graph attention mechanism","N recommendation objective","recommendation systems","Multi-view Memory Attention mechanism","similarity","user-specific information","commuting matrix computation","offline meta-path","end-to-end neural network model","meta-paths","profound user-specific item views","heterogeneous information networks","GAMMA","data sparsity problem present","relevant knowledge","real-world datasets","careful effort","effectiveness","different semantics of items","existing models","following shortcomings","Experiments","challenges","personalization","burden"],"language":"en"},

However, the current model-free DRL methods suffer from low sample efficiency, which is a bottleneck that limits their performance. To alleviate this problem, some researchers used the generative model for modeling the environment. But the generative model may become inaccurate or even collapse if the state has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we introduce a model called Curiosity-driven Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which combines variational autoencoder and curiosity-driven exploration. During the training process, the CVAE model can improve sample efficiency while curiosity-driven exploration can make sufficient exploration in a complex environment. Then, a CVAE-based algorithm is proposed, namely DQN-CVAE, that scales CVAE to higher dimensional environments. Finally, the performance of our algorithm is evaluated through several Atari 2600 games, and the experimental results show that the DQN-CVAE achieves better performance in terms of average reward per episode on these games.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Gao-Jie; Zhang, Xiao-Fang; Wang, Hao; Mao, Chen-Guang","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02b04a625814b839e6d744b3d28f7be15860ad9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206149.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206149/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CVAE model","DQN-CVAE","scales CVAE","generative model","curiosity-driven exploration","CVAE-based algorithm","sufficient exploration","current model-free DRL methods","Variational Autoencoder","better performance","games","low sample efficiency","high-dimensional","complex environment","higher dimensional environments","large-scale space control","terms of average reward","sequential decision-making tasks","deep reinforcement learning","tremendous success","recent years","episode","experimental results","Atari","researchers","bottleneck","training process","problem","state","paper"],"language":"en"},

Off-policy reinforcement learning methods based on Q-learning and actor-critic methods are commonly used to train RS. Though these methods can leverage previously collected dataset for sampling efficient training, they are sensitive to the distribution of off-policy data and make limited progress unless more on-policy data are collected. However, allowing a badly-trained RS to interact with customers can result in unpredictable loss. Therefore, it is highly desirable that the off-policy method can stably train an RS when the off-policy data is fixed and there is no further interaction with the environment.

In this paper, we propose a novel inference algorithm for vector regression tasks which ask workers to provide accurate vectors such as image object localization and human posture estimation. Our algorithm can estimate the true answer of each task and a reliability of each worker by updating two types of messages iteratively.

Chatbots are also preferred by users/customers since unlike other alternatives like calling customer care or browsing over FAQ pages, chatbots provide instant responses, are easy to use, are less invasive and are always available. In this paper, we discuss the problem of FAQ answering which is central to designing a retrieval-based informational chatbot. Given a set of FAQ pages s for an enterprise, and a user query, we need to find the best matching question-answer pairs from s. Building such a semantic ranking system that works well across domains for large QA databases with low runtime and model size is challenging. Previous work based on feature engineering or recurrent neural models either provides low accuracy or incurs high runtime costs. We experiment with multiple transformer based deep learning models, and also propose a novel MT-DNN (Multi-task Deep Neural Network)-based architecture, which we call Masked MT-DNN (or MMT-DNN). MMT-DNN significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art transformer models for the FAQ answering task. Further, we propose an improved knowledge distillation component to achieve [Formula: see text]2.4x reduction in model-size and [Formula: see text]7x reduction in runtime while maintaining similar accuracy.

They can hardly achieve both coherency and saliency since many words have high uncertainties in topic assignments due to their polysemous nature. To solve this problem, we introduce topic-specific co-occurrence of word pairs within contexts in modeling, to generate more coherent segments and alleviate the influence of irrelevant words on topic assignment.

In this paper, we design an event detection algorithm that combines textual, statistical and image information, following an unsupervised machine learning approach.

Based on this finding, the algorithm rejects a candidate if the difference is larger than a threshold.

Recently, this problem was extended to discover trending high utility itemsets (itemsets that yield an increasing or decreasing profit over time). However, an important limitation of that problem is that it is assumed that trends remain stable over time. But in real-life, trends may change in different time intervals due to specific events. To identify time intervals where itemsets have increasing/decreasing trends in terms of utility, this paper proposes the problem of mining Locally Trending High Utility Itemsets (LTHUIs) and their Trending High Utility Periods (THUPs). Properties of the problem are studied and an efficient algorithm named LTHUI-Miner is proposed to enumerate all the LTHUIs and their THUPs. An experimental evaluation shows that the algorithm is efficient and can discover insightful patterns not found by previous algorithms.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fournier-Viger, Philippe; Yang, Yanjun; Lin, Jerry Chun-Wei; Frnda, Jaroslav","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48fe2aad4f383586c3787b1518b33f99ba242e81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206287.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206287/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Trending High Utility Itemsets","Trending High Utility Periods"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["trending high utility itemsets","Trending High Utility Periods","high profit","High utility itemset mining","terms of utility","problem of mining","trends","different time intervals","efficient algorithm","LTHUIs","THUPs","insightful patterns","specific events","customer transaction database","paper","previous algorithms","LTHUI-Miner","experimental evaluation","important limitation","sets of items","Properties"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we combine simple neural networks with two sets of heuristic rules to explore strong baselines for the author name disambiguation problem without any priori knowledge or estimation about cluster size, which frees the model from unnecessary complexity. On a popular benchmark dataset AMiner, our solution significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods both in performance and efficiency, and it still achieves comparable performance with many complex models when only using a group of rules.

The authors hypothesized that the choice of neuromuscular blockade reversal (neostigmine vs. sugammadex) may be associated with a lower incidence of major pulmonary complications. METHODS Twelve U.S. Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group hospitals were included in a multicenter observational matched-cohort study of surgical cases between January 2014 and August 2018. Adult patients undergoing elective inpatient noncardiac surgical procedures with general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation receiving a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade agent and reversal were included. Exact matching criteria included institution, sex, age, comorbidities, obesity, surgical procedure type, and neuromuscular blockade agent (rocuronium vs. vecuronium). Other preoperative and intraoperative factors were compared and adjusted in the case of residual imbalance. The composite primary outcome was major postoperative pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or other pulmonary complications (including pneumonitis; pulmonary congestion; iatrogenic pulmonary embolism, infarction, or pneumothorax). Secondary outcomes focused on the components of pneumonia and respiratory failure. RESULTS Of 30,026 patients receiving sugammadex, 22,856 were matched to 22,856 patients receiving neostigmine. Out of 45,712 patients studied, 1,892 (4.1%) were diagnosed with the composite primary outcome (3.5% sugammadex vs. 4.8% neostigmine). A total of 796 (1.7%) patients had pneumonia (1.3% vs. 2.2%), and 582 (1.3%) respiratory failure (0.8% vs. 1.7%). In multivariable analysis, sugammadex administration was associated with a 30% reduced risk of pulmonary complications (adjusted odds ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.77), 47% reduced risk of pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.62), and 55% reduced risk of respiratory failure (adjusted odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.56), compared to neostigmine.

Countries will face substantial health, economic and social burden deriving from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as influenza, pneumonia and herpes zoster in older adults. It will be essential that countries utilize several public health strategies, including immunization. Understanding the different approaches countries have taken on adult immunization could help provide future learnings and technical support for adult vaccines within life-course immunization strategies. In this study, we describe the priorities and approaches that underlie adult immunization decision-making and implementation processes in 32 high-and-middle-income countries and two territories (\u002234 countries\u0022) who recommend adult vaccines in their national schedule. We conducted an archetype analysis based on a subset of two dozen indicators abstracted from a larger database. The analysis was based on a mixed-methods study, including results from 120 key informant interviews in six countries and a landscape review of secondary data from 34 countries. We found four distinct archetypes: disease prevention-focused; health security-focused; evolving adult focus; and, child-focused and cost-sensitive. The highest performing countries belonged to the disease prevention-focused and health security archetypes, although there was a range of performance within each archetype. Considering common barriers and facilitators of decision-making and implementation of adult vaccines within a primary archetype could help provide a framework for strategies to support countries with similar needs and approaches. It can also help in developing context-specific policies and guidance, including for countries prioritizing adult immunization programs in light of COVID-19. Further research may be beneficial to further refine archetypes and expand the understanding of what influences success within them. This can help advance policies and action that will improve vaccine access for older adults and build a stronger appreciation of the value of immunization amongst a variety of stakeholders.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Privor-Dumm, Lois; Vasudevan, Prarthana; Kobayashi, Kana; Gupta, Jaya","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376108/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adult immunization decision-making","adult immunization programs","different approaches countries","implementation of adult vaccines","middle-income countries","highest performing countries","value of immunization","health security-focused","evolving adult focus","health security archetypes","life-course immunization strategies","disease prevention-focused","public health strategies","child-focused","substantial health","older adults","archetype analysis","distinct archetypes","primary archetype","understanding","global population of adults","facilitators of decision-making","implementation processes","vaccine access","technical support","advance policies","vaccine-preventable diseases","mixed-methods study","developing context-specific policies","social burden","future learnings","results","pneumonia","guidance","influenza","VPDs","herpes zoster","stronger appreciation","landscape review of secondary data","key informant interviews","light of COVID","dozen indicators","action","subset","territories","framework","similar needs","priorities","common barriers","larger database","years of age","cost-sensitive","national schedule","range of performance","variety of stakeholders","influences success","research"],"language":"en"},

However, a few recent studies have demonstrated that repetitive feedback at final recall can reverse the long-term advantage of testing over restudy. The result that feedback at long-term tests can dramatically decrease the relative effectiveness of retrieval-based learning could be important for both theoretical and practical reasons. Considering that these earlier studies administered low retrieval success at retrieval practice, we investigated whether the effect of feedback on the testing effect is modulated by the level of retrieval success during practice. In three experiments the level of success at retrieval practice was manipulated by multiple pre-practice learning trials, and multiple tests with feedback were applied after a 1-week retention interval at final recall. Our results have demonstrated that a feedback-induced reversed testing effect was present only at low retrieval success during practice (Experiment 1), whereas with moderate (Experiment 2) and high retrieval success (Experiment 3) during practice a significant testing effect emerged and no reversed testing effect was found even after repeated cycles of feedback. These results point to the conclusion that the level of retrieval success was the key factor in reversing the testing effect in earlier studies. Application of high retrieval success during practice can produce long-lasting accessible memories even in learning settings applying multiple tests with feedback.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Racsm\u00E1ny, Mih\u00E1ly; Sz\u0151ll\u0151si, \u00C1gnes; Mari\u00E1n, Mikl\u00F3s","journal":"Memory \u0026 cognition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-020-01041-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Retrieval practice","level of retrieval success","effect of feedback","low retrieval success","level of success","Application of high retrieval success","reversed testing effect","significant testing effect","relative effectiveness of retrieval","repetitive feedback","cycles of feedback","multiple pre-practice learning trials","long-term advantage of testing","multiple tests","long-term tests","learning settings","based learning","earlier studies","effective long-term learning strategies","final recall","recent studies","results","repeated study","long-lasting accessible memories","key factor","week retention interval","conclusion","practical reasons","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Themes that emerged from the discussions at the conference include: 1) the importance of trust, transparency, human-centredness and compassion in the development and delivery of digital mental health technologies; 2) an emphasis on equity, diversity, inclusion and access when implementing e-mental health services; 3) the need to ensure that the mental health workforce is able to engage in a digital way of working; and, 4) co-production of e-mental health services among a diverse stakeholder group becomes the standard way of working.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strudwick, Gillian; Impey, Danielle; Torous, John; Krausz, Reinhard Michael; Wiljer, David","journal":"JMIR mental health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330114/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["e-mental health services","mental health workforce","E-mental health technologies","health professional","delivery of digital mental health technologies","Annual Canadian E-Mental Health Conference","Current mental health care delivery models","Canada","model of care delivery","co-production of e","need","digital way of working","access","standard way of working","current form","large number of people","diverse stakeholder group","development","transparency","human-centredness","compassion","inclusion","emphasis","greater depth","important solution","importance of trust","equity","diversity","person","Toronto","topic","problem","discussions","Themes"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN, SETTING Observational study in the two COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhu, Anhui province, China, 24 January - 24 February 2020. PARTICIPANTS Thirty-one patients infected with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) treated at the two designated hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Virus clearance time, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms, by treatment type (including or not including corticosteroid therapy). RESULTS Eleven of 31 patients with COVID-19 received corticosteroid treatment. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated no association between corticosteroid treatment and virus clearance time (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.58-2.74), hospital length of stay (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33-1.78), or duration of symptoms (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.40-1.83). Univariate analysis indicated that virus clearance was slower in two patients with chronic hepatitis B infections (mean difference, 10.6 days; 95% CI, 6.2-15.1 days). CONCLUSIONS Corticosteroids are widely used when treating patients with COVID-19, but we found no association between therapy and outcomes in patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The occurrence of perineal hernia after abdominoperineal resection (APR) is rare, but it has been reported in recent years that the incidence of perineal hernia after rectal cancer surgery has increased. This has been attributed to a shift towards extralevator abdominoperineal resection, together with more frequent and long-term use of neoadjuvant therapy. PRESENTATION OF CASE Here, we report a patient with perineal hernia 5 years after APR surgery for rectal cancer. We decided to perform robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery on this patient using the da Vinci Surgical System. The perineal hernia was repaired by primary closure with the placement of a non-absorbable synthetic mesh as reinforcement for the pelvic floor. No complications occurred during the operation, and the patient was discharged on the third day after the operation. Clinical follow-up proceeded at the designated time intervals without difficulties. DISCUSSION The recurrence rates of perineal hernia are still very high, and due to poor view, suturing, and mesh placement in the deep pelvis, surgeons face many challenges. Many methods have been described, but there is still no consensus as to the optimal repair technique for perineal hernia. CONCLUSION Perineal hernias can be repaired with robot-assisted laparoscopy. Furthermore, compared with the open and laparoscopic methods, suturing and mesh placement are easier with the robot approach.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Deguan; Zhang, Shangxin; Zhang, Zhen; Li, Yongxiang","journal":"International journal of colorectal disease","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-020-03506-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32020267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of perineal hernia","occurrence of perineal hernia","INTRODUCTION Perineal hernia","recurrence rates of perineal hernia","CONCLUSION Perineal hernias","mesh placement","patient","laparoscopic surgery","rectal cancer surgery","pelvic floor","robot approach","laparoscopic methods","suturing","operation","extralevator abdominoperineal resection","non-absorbable synthetic mesh","recent years","reinforcement","deep pelvis","optimal repair technique","protrusion","designated time intervals","poor view","primary closure","long-term use of neoadjuvant therapy","surgeons","intra-abdominal viscera","DISCUSSION","Clinical follow-up","difficulties","challenges","consensus","Vinci Surgical System","shift","day","PRESENTATION OF CASE","complications","laparoscopy"],"language":"en"},

In particular a main interest was hereby the so-called facelift surgery and the first two German pioneers in this field: Eugen Holl\u00E4nder and Erich Lexer. AIM OF THE PAPER The surgeons Eugen Holl\u00E4nder and Erich Lexer contributed to a big part to the development of facelift techniques. The paper aims to highlight in which way both surgeons conducted their research work and the topic of facelift and which findings could be drawn out of their work. METHOD On the basis of old specialist literature and congressional quotations the curriculua vitae of Eugen Holl\u00E4nder and Erich Lexer are portrayed, as well as their professional career and their ground breaking work for facelift surgery and its differences amongst each other. CONCLUSION Both Eugen Holl\u00E4nder and Erich Lexer performed, independently from another, the first facelifts in Germany. Hereby, their operative approach was different. In contrast to Holl\u00E4nder who only performed skin resections for a better tightening of the face, Lexer undermined the skin in an area of multiple centimetres.Even in their suture technique the difference was visible. Lexer for instance conducted a special suture technique by including the fascia temporalis superficialis in his sutures for achieving lasting stability and tension relief. Due to this reason Lexer can be regarded without any doubt as the initial pioneer of modern facelift surgery.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Locher, Wolfgang G; Feinendegen, Dominik L","journal":"Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1150-7343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Erich Lexer","Eugen"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["Erich Lexer","reason Lexer","surgeons Eugen Holl\u00E4nder","so-called facelift surgery","topic of facelift","curriculua vitae of Eugen Holl\u00E4nder","initial pioneer of modern facelift surgery","development of facelift techniques","research work","realm of plastic surgery","better way","PAPER","special suture technique","ground breaking work","skin resections","better tightening","human desire","times of human history","congressional quotations","basis of old specialist literature","sutures","field","fascia temporalis superficialis","beginning","German pioneers","lasting stability","area of multiple centimetres","professional career","doubt","instance","CONCLUSION","tension relief","METHOD","INTRODUCTION","BACKGROUND","AIM","differences","operative approach","century","findings","contrast","facelifts","Germany"],"language":"en"},

The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 in February by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. COVID-19 presents as fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia. In a small subset of severe cases, the disease quickly progresses to respiratory failure and even death. Since the 21st century, there have been three major outbreaks caused by human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that broke out in 2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the recent pandemic of COVID-19. Since 2003, significant progress has been made in the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV concerning their natural origins, pathogenesis, antiviral development and vaccine design. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, previous findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better understanding as well as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we highlight recent progresses in the field; compare the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, prevention and control options; and provide future perspectives for the outcome of the outbreak and research questions to be answered, including some of the difficulties in vaccine development.

Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were made by using a TEMPO oxidation method and celluloses were prepared by acid-base method and extracting method, which were all from corn stalk, an agricultural residual. The prepared celluloses were dissolved separately in DMAc/LiCl solvent and added CNFs of 0.0, 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0% to form all-cellulose nanocomposite, and then casted into films. Morphology, structure and properties of the nanocomposite films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and mechanical testing. RESULTS The all-cellulose nanocomposite films with different cellulose cellulose matrix exhibited a good optical transparency and layer structure. The all-cellulose nanocomposites films with the cellulose prepared by the extracting method (Composite E) exhibited a higher crystallinity, better thermal stability and higher mechanical strength than those of the all-cellulose nanocomposites films with the cellulose prepared by the acid-base method (Composite A). CONCLUSION Crystal structure of the all-cellulose nanocomposite films all presented a co-existence of Cellulose I and Cellulose II. However, on the contrary to Composite A, the diffraction intensity of Cellulose I in Composite E was higher than that of Cellulose II. This was another reason that the mechanical properties of Composite E were superior to Composite A. In addition, the mechanical properties of the all-cellulose nanocomposites films were significantly different when the addition of CNF reached 3.0% in weight, as indicated by a multiple-range comparison.

Ethnicity is known to influence the response to antihypertensives, especially in black populations living in North America and Europe. We sought to outline the impact of all commonly used pharmacological agents on both blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in SSA. METHODS We used similar criteria to previous large meta-analyses of blood pressure agents but restricted results to populations in SSA. Quality of evidence was assessed using a risk of bias tool. Network meta-analysis with random effects was used to compare the effects across interventions and meta-regression to explore participant heterogeneity. RESULTS Thirty-two studies of 2860 participants were identified. Most were small studies from single, urban centres. Compared with placebo, any pharmacotherapy lowered SBP/DBP by 8.51/8.04 mmHg, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were the most efficacious first-line agent with 18.46/11.6 mmHg reduction. Fewer studies assessing combination therapy were available, but there was a trend towards superiority for CCBs plus ACE inhibitors or diuretics compared to other combinations. No studies examined the effect of antihypertensive therapy on morbidity or mortality outcomes. CONCLUSION Evidence broadly supports current guidelines and provides a clear rationale for promoting CCBs as first-line agents and early initiation of combination therapy. However, there is a clear requirement for more evidence to provide a nuanced understanding of stroke and other cardiovascular disease prevention amongst diverse populations on the continent.

China\u0027s national epidemic control has entered a critical stage of overall prevention and control together with the restoration of normal medical care delivery. Based on the characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing, this consensus elaborates on the recommendations from the following four aspects that include patient and medical staff education, optimization of diagnostic and treatment protocols, sterilization of medical devices and the environment, and control of hospital-acquired infection. It is emphasized that the indications for sleep study and NIPAP should be strictly defined according to the local epidemic situation. Portable home sleep study and auto-titration positive airway pressure is recommended. The applications of disposable nasal pressure transducer for sleep study and disposable or personal masks and ventilator tubing for NIPAP are strongly suggested. Moreover, it is necessary to standardize the procedure of NIPAP, to separate the functional divisions in sleep lab, to comply with the protection regulations for medical personnel, and to strengthen the cleaning and disinfection management.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200309-00283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295323/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["sleep lab","characteristics of sleep","Portable home sleep study","medical personnel","medical staff education","procedure of NIPAP","sterilization of medical devices","titration positive airway pressure","non-invasive positive airway pressure","control of hospital","restoration of normal medical care delivery","China\u0027s national epidemic control","applications of disposable nasal pressure transducer","local epidemic situation","optimization of diagnostic","personal masks","treatment protocols","transmission of new coronaviruses","close unprotected contact","therapy","critical stage of overall prevention","intense aerosols","risk of exposure","aspects","ventilator tubing","environment","respiratory droplets","consensus","disordered breathing","patients","functional divisions","protection regulations","cleaning","recommendations","indications","Coronavirus disease","COVID","disinfection management","procedures"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, many countries have implemented different policies to manage this crisis, including curfew and lockdown. However, the efficacy of individual policies remains unclear with respect to COVID-19 case development. METHODS We analyzed available data on COVID-19 cases of eight majorly affected countries, including China, Italy, Iran, Germany, France, Spain, South Korea and Japan. Growth rates and doubling time of cases were calculated for the first six weeks after initial cases were declared for each respective country and put in context with implemented policies. RESULTS While the growth rate of total confirmed COVID-19 cases in China decreased, those for Japan remained constant. For European countries, the growth rate of COVID-19 cases considerably increased during the second time interval. Interestingly, the rates for Germany, Spain and France are the highest measured in the second interval and even surpass the numbers in Italy. CONCLUSIONS While the initial data in Asian countries are encouraging with respect to case development at the initial stage, the opposite is true for European countries. Based on our data, disease management in the two weeks following first reported cases is of utmost importance. This article is protected by copyright.

Children are a particular concern, given that they are more likely than adults to experience medication-related harm. While previous reviews have provided an estimate of prevalence in this population, these predate recent developments in the delivery of paediatric care. Hence, there is a need for an updated, focussed and critical review of the prevalence and nature of drug-related problems in hospitalised children in the UK, in order to support the development and targeting of interventions to improve medication safety. METHODS Nine electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsychInfo, IPA, Scopus, HMIC, BNI, The Cochrane library and clinical trial databases) were searched from January 1999 to April 2019. Studies were included if they were based in the UK, reported on the frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), adverse drug events (ADEs) or medication errors (MEs) affecting hospitalised children. Quality appraisal of the studies was also conducted. RESULTS In all, 26 studies were included. There were no studies which specifically reported prevalence of adverse drug events. Two adverse drug reaction studies reported a median prevalence of 25.6% of patients (IQR 21.8-29.9); 79.2% of reactions warranted withdrawal of medication. Sixteen studies reported on prescribing errors (median prevalence 6.5%; IQR 4.7-13.3); of which, the median rate of dose prescribing errors was 11.1% (IQR 2.9-13). Ten studies reported on administration errors with a median prevalence of 16.3% (IQR 6.4-23). Administration technique errors represented 53% (IQR 52.7-67.4) of these errors. Errors detected during medicines reconciliation at hospital admission affected 43% of patients, 23% (Range 20.1-46) of prescribed medication; 70.3% (Range 50-78) were classified as potentially harmful. Medication errors detected during reconciliation on discharge from hospital affected 33% of patients and 19.7% of medicines, with 22% considered potentially harmful. No studies examined the prevalence of monitoring or dispensing errors. CONCLUSIONS Children are commonly affected by drug-related problems throughout their hospital journey. Given the high prevalence and risk of patient harm,, there is a need for a deeper theoretical understanding of paediatric medication systems to enable more effective interventions to be developed to improve patient safety.","publish_time":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sutherland, Adam; Phipps, Denham L; Tomlin, Stephen; Ashcroft, Darren M","journal":"BMC pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-019-1875-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31829142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medication errors","median prevalence","administration errors","prescribing errors","prevalence of adverse drug events","dispensing errors","medication safety","IQR","adverse drug reaction studies","estimate of prevalence","high prevalence","prevalence of monitoring","drug-related problems","medication-related harm","prescribed medication","withdrawal of medication","Administration technique errors","nature of drug","frequency of adverse drug reactions","hospitalised children","patients","medicines reconciliation","CONCLUSIONS Children","deeper theoretical understanding of paediatric medication systems","BACKGROUND Problems","hospital admission","median rate of dose","hospital journey","risk of patient harm","medicines usage","key patient safety issue","need","UK","Range","electronic databases","effective interventions","clinical trial databases","delivery of paediatric care","ADRs","BNI","HMIC","IPA","PsychInfo","Medline","Cochrane library","Embase","CINAHL","ADEs","Scopus","MEs","recent developments","population","critical review","adults","discharge","METHODS","order","previous reviews","particular concern","Quality appraisal","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

As there is currently no randomized controlled trial (RCT) reporting long-term patient-reported outcomes between CTEP and STEP, we reviewed patients who were randomized to CTEP or STEP 5 years after surgery. METHODS Telephone interviews were administered to patients with primary unilateral inguinal hernia recruited for the RCT comparing CTEP and STEP in 2011. The modified Body Image Questionnaire was used to measure long-term patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS Forty-two out of forty-nine of the STEP group and forty-one out of fifty of the CTEP group responded to phone interviews. Median follow-up time, demographic data and clinical outcomes were comparable between both groups. The Body Image Score (5-20: 5-least dissatisfied, 20-most dissatisfied; BIS score \u00B1 SD, STEP vs. CTEP, 5.33 \u00B1 0.90 vs. 7.17 \u00B1 1.87, p \u003C 0.001) and Cosmetic Score (2-20: 2-least satisfied, 20-most satisfied; CS score \u00B1 SD, STEP vs. CTEP, 19.05 \u00B1 1.31 vs. 15.87 \u00B1 1.57, p \u003C 0.001) were superior in the STEP group.

AIM The aim of this study was to understand the role and experience of hospital palliative care volunteers. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed and three dissertation databases were searched from inception to June 2019. A forward and backward search of included papers in key journals was also undertaken. Records were independently assessed against inclusion criteria by authors. Included papers were assessed for quality, but none were excluded. RESULTS In total, 14 papers were included. Hospital palliative care volunteers were mostly female, aged above 40 years, and training varied considerably. Volunteers faced unique challenges in supporting dying patients due to the nature of hospital care, rapid patient turnover and the once-off nature of support. Volunteer roles were diverse, with some providing hands-on care, but most focused on \u0027being with\u0027 the dying patient. Volunteers were appreciated for providing psychosocial support, seen as complementary to, rather than replacing the work of health professionals. Given volunteers were often required to work across multiple wards, establishing positive work relationships with health professionals was challenging. Divergent views about whether the volunteer was part of or external to the team impacted volunteers\u0027 experience and perceptions of the value of their contribution. CONCLUSION Hospital palliative care volunteers face unique challenges in supporting terminally ill patients.

Metabolites such as amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids are central to viral proteins, genomes, and envelopes, and the availability of these molecules can restrict or promote infection. Polyamines, comprised of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine in mammalian cells, are also critical for virus infection. Polyamines are small, positively charged molecules that function in transcription, translation, and cell cycling. Initial work on the function of polyamines in bacteriophage infection illuminated these molecules as critical to virus infection. In the decades since early virus-polyamine descriptions, work on diverse viruses continues to highlight a role for polyamines in viral processes, including genome packaging and viral enzymatic activity. On the host side, polyamines function in the response to virus infection. Thus, viruses and hosts compete for polyamines, which are a critical resource for both. Pharmacologically targeting polyamines, tipping the balance to favor the host and restrict virus replication, holds significant promise as a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Firpo, Mason R; Mounce, Bryan C","journal":"Biomolecules","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10040628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of polyamines","polyamines function","virus infection","molecules","virus replication","bacteriophage infection","host cells","diverse viruses","viral processes","viral proteins","early virus-polyamine descriptions","critical resource","building blocks of progeny viruses","viral enzymatic activity","mammalian cells","Initial work","genome packaging","lipids","significant promise","nucleotides","spermidine","role","amino acids","broad-spectrum antiviral strategy","spermine","transcription","translation","envelopes","genomes","decades","obligate intracellular parasites","response","cell cycling","Metabolites","putrescine","availability","balance","hosts"],"language":"en"},

The complement fragment C5a holds significant proinflammatory functions and is associated with tissue damage in various inflammatory conditions. The authors hypothesized that C5a concentrations are increased in pneumonia and C5a neutralization promotes barrier stabilization in the lung and is protective in pneumococcal pulmonary sepsis. METHODS The authors investigated regulation of C5a in pneumonia in a prospective patient cohort and in experimental pneumonia. Two complementary models of murine pneumococcal pneumonia were applied. Female mice were treated with NOX-D19, a C5a-neutralizing L-RNA-aptamer. Lung, liver, and kidney injury and the inflammatory response were assessed by measuring pulmonary permeability (primary outcome), pulmonary and blood leukocytes, cytokine concentrations in lung and blood, and bacterial load in lung, spleen, and blood, and performing histologic analyses of tissue damage, apoptosis, and fibrin deposition (n = 5 to 13). RESULTS In hospitalized patients with pneumonia (n = 395), higher serum C5a concentrations were observed compared to healthy subjects (n = 24; 6.3 nmol/l [3.9 to 10.0] vs. 4.5 nmol/l [3.8 to 6.6], median [25 to 75% interquartile range]; difference: 1.4 [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.9]; P = 0.029). Neutralization of C5a in mice resulted in lower pulmonary permeability in pneumococcal pneumonia (1.38 \u00B1 0.89 vs. 3.29 \u00B1 2.34, mean \u00B1 SD; difference: 1.90 [95% CI, 0.15 to 3.66]; P = 0.035; n = 10 or 11) or combined severe pneumonia and mechanical ventilation (2.56 \u00B1 1.17 vs. 7.31 \u00B1 5.22; difference: 4.76 [95% CI, 1.22 to 8.30]; P = 0.011; n = 9 or 10). Further, C5a neutralization led to lower blood granulocyte colony-stimulating factor concentrations and protected against sepsis-associated liver injury. CONCLUSIONS Systemic C5a is elevated in pneumonia patients. Neutralizing C5a protected against lung and liver injury in pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. Early neutralization of C5a might be a promising adjunctive treatment strategy to improve outcome in community-acquired pneumonia. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Pneumonia, sepsis, and immune dysregulation cause morbidity and mortalityC5a is a component of the complement system and a proinflammatory mediator that modulates the innate immune response in critical illnessDisruption of the C5a receptor axis with antibodies or antagonists was previously protective in various animal sepsis models WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, serum C5a concentrations were 1.4-fold higher compared to healthy subjectsIn two mouse models of pneumonia and sepsis, NOX-D19, a C5a-neutralizing L-RNA aptamer, caused lower pulmonary hyperpermeability and sepsis-related acute liver injury.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCller-Redetzky, Holger; Kellermann, Ute; Wienhold, Sandra-Maria; Gutbier, Birgitt; Lienau, Jasmin; Hellwig, Katharina; Reppe, Katrin; Letsiou, Eleftheria; Tschernig, Thomas; Scholz, Markus; Ahnert, Peter; Maasch, Christian; Hoehlig, Kai; Klussmann, Sven; Vater, Axel; Firsching, Theresa C; Hoppe, Judith; Suttorp, Norbert; Witzenrath, Martin","journal":"Anesthesiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000003149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32101978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C5a neutralization","pneumonia patients","Neutralizing C5a","experimental pneumonia","severe pneumonia","regulation of C5a","Early neutralization of C5a","lung","mouse models of pneumonia","higher serum C5a concentrations","complement fragment C5a","pneumococcal pulmonary sepsis","C5a receptor axis","CONCLUSIONS Systemic C5a","complementary models of murine pneumococcal pneumonia","sepsis-related acute liver injury","lower pulmonary permeability","various animal sepsis models","lower pulmonary hyperpermeability","factor concentrations","cytokine concentrations","difference","associated sepsis cause high mortality","blood leukocytes","inflammatory response","kidney injury","hospitalized patients","lower blood granulocyte colony","unfavorable outcome","primary outcome","various inflammatory conditions","BACKGROUND Community","NOX-D19","Female mice","RNA-aptamer","RNA aptamer","authors","nmol","innate immune response","immune dysregulation cause morbidity","proinflammatory mediator","antibiotic treatment","histologic analyses of tissue damage","complement system","healthy subjectsIn","Uncontrolled inflammatory host responses","significant proinflammatory functions","promising adjunctive treatment strategy","apoptosis","antagonists","critical illnessDisruption","mortalityC5a","prospective patient cohort","barrier stabilization","component","antibodies","ARTICLE","bacterial load","fold","fibrin deposition","extrapulmonary organ failure","spleen","mechanical ventilation","METHODS","RESULTS","interquartile range","TOPIC"],"language":"en"},

Thirteen RCTs were included in random-effects meta-analyses. Risk ratios (RR) and risk difference were calculated as pooled effect sizes. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the Cochrane tool accounting for cluster RCTs. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for risk of bias and design characteristics. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed. Results Psychosocial interventions reduced any form of IPV by 27% at shortest (relative risk (RR) = 0.73) and 25% at longest (RR = 0.75) follow up.

The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might cause olfactory dysfunction is certainly plausible. Patients presenting to specialized smell clinics are commonly diagnosed with upper respiratory infection (URI)-associated olfactory loss and most are presumed to be viral related. In acute phases of infection, it is common to experience some smell loss as a result of nasal inflammation, mucosal edema, and obstruction of airflow into the olfactory cleft. In most cases, these episodes of smell loss are self-limiting and coincide with resolution of URI symptoms. However, in some cases the smell loss persists for months to years and this is presumed to occur through a more direct olfactory insult by the virus. It remains too early to know whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent olfactory dysfunction. However, given the scale of this pandemic, if SARS-CoV-2 does cause chronic olfactory loss in even a small portion of those infected, then the overall population prevalence could be quite large. This review provides a brief, practical overview of viral-associated olfactory loss, realizing that evidence related to COVID-19 will likely not be clear for some time. Our goal is to highlight the existence and importance of this condition and provide information geared for both providers and patients. Practical suggestions regarding evaluation and treatment will be provided, realizing that there may be constraints on medical resources and the nature of this pandemic remains dynamic.

The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether psychosocial interventions increase positive affect in cancer survivors. METHODS We coded 28 randomized controlled trials of psychosocial interventions assessing 2082 cancer survivors from six electronic databases. We calculated 76 effect sizes for positive affect and conducted synthesis using random effects models with robust variance estimation. Tests for moderation included demographic, clinical, and intervention characteristics. RESULTS Interventions had a modest effect on positive affect (g = 0.35, 95% CI [0.16, 0.54]) with substantial heterogeneity of effects across studies ([Formula: see text]; I2 = 78%). Three significant moderators were identified: in-person interventions outperformed remote interventions (P = .046), effects were larger when evaluated against standard of care or wait list control conditions versus attentional, educational, or component controls (P = .009), and trials with survivors of early-stage cancer diagnoses yielded larger effects than those with advanced-stage diagnoses (P = .046). We did not detect differential benefits of psychosocial interventions across samples varying in sex, age, on-treatment versus off-treatment status, or cancer type. Although no conclusive evidence suggested outcome reporting biases (P = .370), effects were smaller in studies with lower risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS In-person interventions with survivors of early-stage cancers hold promise for enhancing positive affect, but more methodological rigor is needed. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS Positive affect strategies can be an explicit target in evidence-based medicine and have a role in patient-centered survivorship care, providing tools to uniquely mobilize human strengths.","publish_time":"2019-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salsman, John M; Pustejovsky, James E; Schueller, Stephen M; Hernandez, Rosalba; Berendsen, Mark; McLouth, Laurie E Steffen; Moskowitz, Judith T","journal":"Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-019-00811-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31741250/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["person interventions","CANCER SURVIVORS Positive affect strategies","remote interventions","RESULTS Interventions","PURPOSE Positive affect","differential benefits of psychosocial interventions","survivors of early","larger effects","stage cancer diagnoses","randomized controlled trials of psychosocial interventions","cancer type","random effects models","substantial heterogeneity of effects","studies","stage cancers","advanced-stage diagnoses","explicit target","unique benefits","standard of care","modest effect","conclusive evidence","important target","effect sizes","treatment status","evidence-based medicine","patient-centered survivorship care","synthesis","role","samples","list control conditions","robust variance estimation","demographic","tools","context of health","outcome reporting biases","sex","IMPLICATIONS","meta-analysis","lower risk of bias","component controls","Formula","related stress","Tests","moderation","intervention characteristics","primary objective","METHODS","electronic databases","methodological rigor","CONCLUSIONS","human strengths","I2","significant moderators"],"language":"en"},

A Report of Thromboelastography Findings and other Parameters of Hemostasis.","doi":"10.1111/jth.14850","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32302438","license":"unk","abstract":"BACKGROUND The severe inflammatory state secondary to Covid-19 leads to a severe derangement of hemostasis that has been recently described as a state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and consumption coagulopathy, defined as decreased platelet count, increased fibrin(ogen) degradation products such as D-dimer as well as low fibrinogen. AIMS Whole blood from 24 patients admitted at the intensive care unit because of Covid-19 was collected and evaluated with thromboelastography by the TEG point-of-care device on a single occasion and six underwent repeated measurements on two consecutive days for a total of 30 observations. Plasma was evaluated for the other parameters of hemostasis. RESULTS TEG parameters are consistent with a state of hypercoagulability as shown by decreased R and K values, and increased values of K angle and MA. Platelet count was normal or increased, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were near(normal). Fibrinogen was increased and D-dimer was dramatically increased. C-reactive protein was increased. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (n=11) were increased. Antithrombin (n=11) was marginally decreased and protein C (n=11) was increased. CONCLUSION The results of this cohort of patients with Covid-19 are not consistent with acute DIC, rather they support hypercoagulability together with a severe inflammatory state. These findings may explain the events of venous thromboembolism observed in some of these patients and support antithrombotic prophylaxis/treatment. Clinical trials are urgently needed to establish the type of drug, dosage and optimal duration of prophylaxis.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Panigada, Mauro; Bottino, Nicola; Tagliabue, Paola; Grasselli, Giacomo; Novembrino, Cristina; Chantarangkul, Veena; Pesenti, Antonio; Peyvandi, Fora; Tripodi, Armando","journal":"Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302438/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Antithrombin"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased values","increased fibrin","Covid","state of hypercoagulability","severe inflammatory state secondary","decreased platelet count","cohort of patients","D-dimer","RESULTS TEG parameters","severe derangement of hemostasis","parameters of hemostasis","protein C","C-reactive protein","prothrombin time","care device","TEG point","acute DIC","antithrombotic prophylaxis","Willebrand factor","low fibrinogen","partial thromboplastin time","intensive care unit","optimal duration of prophylaxis","consumption coagulopathy","degradation products","leads","repeated measurements","dosage","single occasion","consecutive days","intravascular coagulation","BACKGROUND","type of drug","total","events of venous thromboembolism","treatment","angle","findings","observations","CONCLUSION","thromboelastography","Clinical trials","Plasma","Antithrombin","blood"],"language":"en"},

We explored the patients treated by thrombectomy to investigate the association between a favorable clinical outcome of EVMT in intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion (iICAO) and a set of predictors. METHODS A total of 38 iICAO patients treated by EVMTs were analyzed. Primary collateral grades (PCG) at baseline based on the integrity of Willis\u0027 circle were categorized into three degrees. The favorable outcomes, measured by modified Rankin scale (mRS), were defined as \u22642 at 90 days. The reperfusion was one of the most important confounders, defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) \u2265 2b. The other risk factors included demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, procedural EVMT, and PCG at baseline was adjusted to reveal the association with favorable outcomes. RESULTS Of 38 iICAO patients, 65.8% (25 in 38) achieved reperfusion. However, only 31.6% (12/38) achieved favorable outcomes at 90 days. With a PCG3, 61.5% of them achieved favorable outcomes, while only 37.5% of those with PCG2 and PCG1 achieved favorable outcomes (p = .003). In multivariable logistic regression, PCG was revealed as a predictor for favorable outcomes (OR 5.278, p = .019) after adjusting the reperfusion and other factors. CONCLUSIONS The PCG based on the integrity of Willis\u0027 circle might be an underlying predictor of the prognosis of AIS in patients with iICAO after EVMT. The function of intact anterior communicating artery (AcoA) and ipsilateral posterior communicating artery (PcoA) in favoring prognosis of the iICAO patients might need to be validation in future study.","publish_time":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Hongchen; Wang, Baolin; Xu, Ganggang; Dong, Yi; Dong, Qiang; Cao, Wenjie","journal":"Brain and behavior","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696661/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rankin"],"organizations":["EVMT","PCG","AIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["favorable outcomes","iICAO patients","favorable clinical outcome of EVMT","reperfusion","procedural EVMT","proximal artery occlusion","vascular risk factors","prognosis of AIS","baseline","circle","integrity of Willis","association","days","intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion","function of intact anterior communicating artery","stroke severity","modified thrombolysis","underlying predictor","acute ischemic stroke","modified Rankin scale","PURPOSE Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy","AcoA","significant promise","demographic characteristics","ipsilateral posterior","cerebral infarction","mTICI","BACKGROUND","PcoA","validation","PCG1","Primary collateral grades","important confounders","mRS","multivariable logistic regression","METHODS","total","PCG2","set of predictors","future study","CONCLUSIONS","EVMTs","RESULTS","degrees","PCG3"],"language":"en"},

In one stage of the on-site biological treatment, the major bacterial community was identified to be mesophilic and facultative; Lactobacillus was the most dominant genus, accounting for 78.1% of bacterial community. Total mass reduction of FW approached 90.15% by increasing removal of both moisture and the organic portion of FW. In addition, the solids and liquids of the final by-products have the potential to be recycled into resources such as fertilizer, a bio-solid refuse fuel or external carbon sources for wastewater treatment plants.

To curb the spreading of the virus, WHO urgently demanded an extension of screening and testing; thus, a rapid and simple diagnostic method is needed. We applied a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to achieve the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 30 min. We designed four sets of LAMP primers (6 primers in each set), targeting the viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the regions of orf1ab, S gene and N gene. A colorimetric change was used to report the results, which enables the outcome of viral RNA amplification to be read by the naked eye without the need of expensive or dedicated instrument. The sensitivity can be 80 copies of viral RNA per ml in a sample. We validated the RT-LAMP method in a hospital in China, employing 16 clinic samples with 8 positives and 8 negatives. The testing results are consistent with the conventional RT-qPCR. In addition, we also show that one-step process without RNA extraction is feasible to achieve RNA amplification directly from a sample. This rapid, simple and sensitive RT-LAMP method paves a way for a large screening at public domain and hospitals, particularly regional hospitals and medical centres in rural areas.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Wei E; Lim, Boon; Hsu, Chia-Chen; Xiong, Dan; Wu, Wei; Yu, Yejiong; Jia, Huidong; Wang, Yun; Zeng, Yida; Ji, Mengmeng; Chang, Hong; Zhang, Xiuming; Wang, Hui; Cui, Zhanfeng","journal":"Microbial biotechnology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333644/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAMP"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["viral RNA of SARS","RNA extraction","sensitive RT-LAMP method","outcome of viral RNA amplification","copies of viral RNA","sets of LAMP primers","isothermal amplification","large screening","conventional RT-qPCR","simple diagnostic method","testing results","pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV","detection of SARS","regional hospitals","S gene","N gene","extension of screening","large infected population","public domain","way","medical centres","need of expensive","China","rural areas","one-step process","regions of orf1ab","clinic samples","reverse transcription-loop","world","naked eye","positives","dedicated instrument","COVID","negatives","sensitivity","colorimetric change","spreading","addition"],"language":"en"},

Initially, little was known about the virus. As research continues, we have learned the genome structure, epidemiological and clinical characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. Based on these discoveries, identifying potential targets involved in the processes of virus pathogenesis is urgently needed, and discovering or developing promising drugs based on potential targets is the most pressing need. Therefore, we summarize the potential therapeutic targets involved in virus pathogenesis and discuss the advancements, possibilities and significance of promising drugs based on these targets for treating SARS-CoV-2. This review will facilitate the identification of potential targets and provide promising clues for drug development that can be translated into clinical applications for combating SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Hong; Fang, Yan; Xu, Tao; Ni, Wei-Jian; Shen, Ai-Zong; Meng, Xiao-Ming","journal":"British journal of pharmacology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","identification of potential targets","potential therapeutic targets","promising clues","pathogenic mechanisms of SARS","significance of promising drugs","processes of virus pathogenesis","clinical characteristics","clinical applications","possibilities","advancements","genome structure","drug development","novel coronavirus","pressing need","deaths","confirmed cases","uncontrollable situation","review","discoveries","research"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to explore this research burden (i.e., the psychological, physical, and financial burdens) experienced by patients through their participation in a RCT. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies exploring adult patients\u0027 experiences with RCT participation. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, and Embase (search date March 2018) for eligible reports. Qualitative data coding and indexing were assisted by NVivo. The quality of reports was assessed by using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool. RESULTS We included 45 qualitative studies that involved 1732 RCT participants. Important psychological burdens were identified at every stage of the trial process. Participants reported feeling anxiety and being afraid of \u0022being a \u0027guinea pig\u0027\u0022 and described undergoing randomization and allocation to a placebo as particularly difficult resulting in disappointment, anger, and depression. Patients\u0027 follow-up and trial closure were also responsible for a wide range of psychological, physical, and financial burdens. Furthermore, factors related to burdensome impacts and consequences were discerned. These factors involved trial information, poorly organized and too-demanding follow-up, and lack of appropriate management when the patient\u0027s participation ended. Trial participation was also associated with beneficial effects such as the satisfaction of feeling \u0022useful,\u0022 gaining \u0022a sense of control,\u0022 and receiving special attention. CONCLUSIONS Our finding provides a detailed description of research burden across the whole RCT process. Many of the burdens described could be anticipated, and some avoided in a movement toward minimally disruptive clinical research. Such an approach could improve trial recruitment and retention.

A negative-binomial regression model was used to estimate influenza-associated EMRs in two age groups (\u003C65 years and \u226565 years).Results: It was estimated that an annual average of 10025 influenza-associated deaths occurred in Chongqing, corresponding to 5.2% of all deaths. The average EMR for all-cause death associated with influenza was 33.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 31.5-35.6) per 100 000 persons, and in separate cause-specific models we attributed 24.7 (95% CI: 23.3-26.0), 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-0.8), 8.5 (95% CI: 8.1-9.0) and 5.0 (95% CI: 4.7-5.3) per 100 000 persons EMRs to CRD, P\u0026I, COPD and IDH, respectively. The estimated EMR for influenza B virus was 20.6 (95% CI: 20.3-21.0), which was significantly higher than the rates of 5.3 (95% CI: 4.5-6.1) and 7.5 (95% CI: 6.7-8.3) for A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, respectively.

Influenza B virus caused a relatively higher excess mortality impact compared with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2).

This murine virus is used as a common model to study both acute and chronic virus-induced demyelination in the central nervous system. Studies with recombinant MHV strains that differ in the gene encoding the spike protein have demonstrated that the spike has a role in both MHV pathogenesis and retrograde axonal transport. Fusion peptides (FPs) in the spike protein play a key role in MHV pathogenesis. In a previous study of the effect of deleting a single proline residue in the FP of a demyelinating MHV strain, we found that two central, consecutive prolines are important for cell-cell fusion and pathogenesis. The dihedral fluctuation of the FP was showed to be repressed whenever two consecutive prolines (PP) were present, in contrast to the presence of a single proline (P) in the chain. Using this proline-deleted MHV strain, here we investigated whether intracranial injection of this strain can induce optic neuritis by retrograde axonal transport from the brain to the retina through the optic nerve. We observed that the proline-deleted recombinant MHV strain is restricted to the optic nerve, is unable to translocate to the retina, and causes only minimal demyelination and no neuronal death. We conclude that an intact proline dyad in the FP of the recombinant demyelinating MHV strain plays a crucial role in translocation of the virus through axons and subsequent neurodegeneration.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rout, Saurav Saswat; Singh, Manmeet; Shindler, Kenneth S; Das Sarma, Jayasri","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.011918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32249210/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV pathogenesis","proline-deleted MHV strain","recombinant demyelinating MHV strain","recombinant MHV strains","murine virus","optic neuritis","optic nerve","single proline residue","spike protein","retrograde axonal transport","intact proline dyad","chronic virus-induced demyelination","crucial role","Mouse hepatitis virus","key role","cell-cell fusion","minimal demyelination","axonal loss","consecutive prolines","retina","murine coronavirus","previous study","Fusion peptides","central nervous system","presence","common model","effect","translocation","contrast","CoV","axons","PP","meningoencephalitis","myelitis","FPs","brain","neuronal death","subsequent neurodegeneration","Studies","intracranial injection","dihedral fluctuation","chain"],"language":"en"},

Despite near hourly reporting on this crisis, there has been no regular, updated, or accurate reporting of hospitalizations for COVID-19. It is known that many test-positive individuals may not develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms. However some individuals develop a more fulminant syndrome including viral pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring oxygen, acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation, and in substantial fractions leading to death attributable to COVID-19. The pandemic is evolving in a clustered, non-inform fashion resulting in many hospitals with preparedness but few or no cases, and others that are completely overwhelmed. Thus, a considerable risk of spread when personal protection equipment becomes exhausted and a large fraction of mortality in those not offered mechanical ventilation are both attributable to a crisis due to maldistribution of resources. The pandemic is amenable to self-reporting through a mobile phone application that could obtain critical information on suspected cases and report on the results of self testing and actions taken. The only method to understand the clustering and the immediate hospital resource needs is mandatory, uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units. Current reports of hospitalizations are delayed, uncertain, and wholly inadequate. This paper urges all the relevant stakeholders to take up self-reporting and reporting of hospitalizations of COVID-19 as an urgent task in combating this devastating pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCullough, Peter A; Eidt, John; Rangaswami, Janani; Lerma, Edgar; Tumlin, James; Wheelan, Kevin; Katz, Nevin; Lepor, Norman E; Vijay, Kris; Soman, Sandeep; Singh, Bhupinder; McCullough, Sean P; McCullough, Haley B; Palazzuoli, Alberto; Ruocco, Gaetano M; Ronco, Claudio","journal":"Reviews in cardiovascular medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm.2020.01.42; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32259899/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["self-reporting","hourly reporting","accurate reporting of hospitalizations","daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID","hospital wards","fulminant syndrome","mechanical ventilation","suspected cases","crisis","devastating pandemic","acute respiratory distress syndrome","mild self-limited viral syndrome","Current reports of hospitalizations","respiratory failure","immediate hospital resource needs","viral pneumonia","community health","economic health","constitutional symptoms","death attributable","test-positive individuals","oxygen","uniform","fragile relationship","fever","imminent threats","critical information","malaise","mobile phone application","personal protection equipment","substantial fractions","widespread chain of events","dry cough","clustering","results of self testing","large fraction of mortality","intensive care units","fashion","relevant stakeholders","urgent task","considerable risk","hospitals","globe","preparedness","SARS-CoV","maldistribution of resources","China","days","paper","Wuhan","method"],"language":"en"},

One of their most controversial and puzzling features is their distinctive caudal anatomy, which has been suggested as a mechanism to facilitate caudal autotomy. Several researchers have described putative fracture planes in mesosaur caudal vertebrae - unossified regions in the middle of caudal vertebral centra - that in many extant squamates allow the tail to separate and the animal to escape predation. However, the reports of fracture planes in mesosaurs have never been closely investigated beyond preliminary descriptions, which has prompted scepticism. Here, using numerous vertebral series, histology, and X-ray computed tomography, we provide a detailed account of fracture planes in all three species of mesosaurs. Given the importance of the tail for propulsion in many other aquatic reptiles, the identification of fracture planes in mesosaurs has important implications for their aquatic locomotion. Despite mesosaurs apparently having the ability to autotomize their tail, it is unlikely that they actually made use of this behaviour due to a lack of predation pressure and no record of autotomized tails in articulated specimens. We suggest that the presence of fracture planes in mesosaurs is an evolutionary relic and could represent a synapomorphy for an as-yet undetermined terrestrial clade of Palaeozoic amniotes that includes the earliest radiation of secondarily aquatic tetrapods.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacDougall, Mark J; Verri\u00E8re, Antoine; Wintrich, Tanja; LeBlanc, Aaron R H; Fernandez, Vincent; Fr\u00F6bisch, J\u00F6rg","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63625-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["putative fracture planes","identification of fracture planes","reports of fracture planes","presence of fracture planes","species of mesosaurs","detailed account of fracture planes","early Permian mesosaurs","caudal autotomy","aquatic reptiles","aquatic tetrapods","aquatic locomotion","aquatic environments","middle of caudal vertebral centra","distinctive caudal anatomy","mesosaur caudal vertebrae - unossified regions","numerous vertebral series","lack of predation pressure","undetermined terrestrial clade of Palaeozoic amniotes","record of autotomized tails","histology","important implications","X-ray computed tomography","puzzling features","earliest radiation","evolutionary relic","articulated specimens","propulsion","extant squamates","synapomorphy","behaviour","researchers","preliminary descriptions","scepticism","use","importance","mechanism","animal","ability"],"language":"en"},

Besides well-established imaging techniques such O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET)-PET and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion imaging, amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging has emerged as a promising novel MR technique. In this study, we aimed to better understand the relation between these imaging biomarkers and how well they capture cellularity and vascularity in newly diagnosed gliomas. METHODS Preoperative MRI and FET-PET data of 46 patients (31 glioblastoma and 15 lower-grade glioma) were segmented into contrast-enhancing and FLAIR-hyperintense areas. Using established cutoffs, we calculated hot-spot volumes (HSV) and their spatial overlap. We further investigated APTw and CBV values in FET-HSV. In a subset of 10 glioblastoma patients, we compared cellularity and vascularization in 34 stereotactically targeted biopsies with imaging. RESULTS In glioblastomas, the largest HSV was found for APTw, followed by PET and CBV (p \u003C 0.05). In lower-grade gliomas, APTw-HSV was clearly lower than in glioblastomas. The spatial overlap of HSV was highest between APTw and FET in both tumor entities and regions. APTw correlated significantly with cellularity, similar to FET, while the association with vascularity was more pronounced in CBV and FET. CONCLUSIONS We found a relevant spatial overlap in glioblastomas between hotspots of APTw and FET both in contrast-enhancing and FLAIR-hyperintense tumor. As suggested by earlier studies, APTw was lower in lower-grade gliomas compared with glioblastomas. APTw meaningfully contributes to biological imaging of gliomas.","publish_time":"2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00F6n, S; Cabello, J; Liesche-Starnecker, F; Molina-Romero, M; Eichinger, P; Metz, M; Karimov, I; Preibisch, C; Keupp, J; Hock, A; Meyer, B; Weber, W; Zimmer, C; Pyka, T; Yakushev, I; Gempt, J; Wiestler, B","journal":"European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-019-04677-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31953672/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CBV","HSV","FET"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["APTw-HSV","FET-HSV","hotspots of APTw","perfusion imaging","imaging biomarkers","lower-grade gliomas","biological imaging of gliomas","glioblastomas","FET-PET data","spatial overlap of HSV","largest HSV","cellularity","well-established imaging techniques","PURPOSE Imaging glioma biology","diagnosed gliomas","relevant spatial overlap","glioblastoma patients","vascularity","CBV values","FLAIR-hyperintense tumor","dynamic susceptibility contrast","FLAIR-hyperintense areas","tumor entities","DSC","great promise","amide proton transfer","vascularization","stereotactically targeted biopsies","METHODS Preoperative MRI","hot-spot volumes","complex nature","association","promising novel MR technique","earlier studies","CONCLUSIONS","regions","tyrosine","RESULTS","established cutoffs","fluoroethyl","tumors","subset","relation","study"],"language":"en"},

A total of 186 patients, including 36 deaths, had been diagnosed with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection as of September 30th, 2015. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained information of patients who were confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 16 to 86). A total of 55.4% of the patients had one or more coexisting medical conditions. The most common symptom was fever (95.2%). At admission, leukopenia (42.6%), thrombocytopenia (46.6%), and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (42.7%) were observed. Pneumonia was detected in 68.3% of patients at admission and developed in 80.8% during the disease course. Antiviral agents were used for 74.7% of patients. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and convalescent serum were employed for 24.5%, 7.1%, and 3.8% of patients, respectively. Older age, presence of coexisting medical conditions including diabetes or chronic lung disease, presence of dyspnea, hypotension, and leukocytosis at admission, and the use of mechanical ventilation were revealed to be independent predictors of death. CONCLUSION: The clinical features of MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea were similar to those of previous outbreaks in the Middle East. However, the overall mortality rate (20.4%) was lower than that in previous reports. Enhanced surveillance and active management of patients during the outbreak may have resulted in improved outcomes.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Won Suk; Kang, Cheol-In; Kim, Yonjae; Choi, Jae-Phil; Joh, Joon Sung; Shin, Hyoung-Shik; Kim, Gayeon; Peck, Kyong Ran; Chung, Doo Ryeon; Kim, Hye Ok; Song, Sook Hee; Kim, Yang Ree; Sohn, Kyung Mok; Jung, Younghee; Bang, Ji Hwan; Kim, Nam Joong; Lee, Kkot Sil; Jeong, Hye Won; Rhee, Ji-Young; Kim, Eu Suk; Woo, Heungjeong; Oh, Won Sup; Huh, Kyungmin; Lee, Young Hyun; Song, Joon Young; Lee, Jacob; Lee, Chang-Seop; Kim, Baek-Nam; Choi, Young Hwa; Jeong, Su Jin; Lee, Jin-Soo; Yoon, Ji Hyun; Wi, Yu Mi; Joung, Mi Kyong; Park, Seong Yeon; Lee, Sun Hee; Jung, Sook-In; Kim, Shin-Woo; Lee, Jae Hoon; Lee, Hyuck; Ki, Hyun Kyun; Kim, Yeon-Sook","journal":"Infect Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d8907508d6c233f454408abbfd624a9fda81f37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4945721.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27433382/; https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2016.48.2.118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Arabian Peninsula","Republic"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","information of patients","MERS-coronavirus","active management of patients","admission","clinical features of MERS","presence of coexisting medical conditions","Republic of Korea","total","use of mechanical ventilation","presence of dyspnea","largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome","Older age","median age","previous outbreaks","disease course","previous reports","chronic lung disease","diabetes","real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","hypotension","convalescent serum","leukocytosis","Enhanced surveillance","independent predictors of death","CONCLUSION","METHODS","years","Arabian Peninsula","overall mortality rate","common symptom","fever","elevation of aspartate aminotransferase","MATERIALS","improved outcomes","RESULTS","leukopenia","range","deaths","Antiviral agents","thrombocytopenia","BACKGROUND","Pneumonia"],"language":"en"},

Since then the virus has spread rapidly nationwide and to Canada and Mexico causing high mortality among nursing piglets and significant economic losses. Currently there are no efficacious preventive measures or therapeutic tools to control PEDV in the US. The isolation of PEDV in cell culture is the first step toward the development of an attenuated vaccine, to study the biology of PEDV and to develop in vitro PEDV immunoassays, inactivation assays and screen for PEDV antivirals. In this study, nine of 88 US PEDV strains were isolated successfully on Vero cells with supplemental trypsin and subjected to genomic sequence analysis. They differed genetically mainly in the N-terminal S protein region as follows: (1) strains (n =7) similar to the highly virulent US PEDV strains; (2) one similar to the reportedly US S INDEL PEDV strain; and (3) one novel strain most closely related to highly virulent US PEDV strains, but with a large (197aa) deletion in the S protein. Representative strains of these three genetic groups were passaged serially and grew to titers of \u223C5\u20136log10 plaque forming units/mL. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation in cell culture of an S INDEL PEDV strain and a PEDV strain with a large (197aa) deletion in the S protein. We also designed primer sets to detect these genetically diverse US PEDV strains.","publish_time":"2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oka, Tomoichiro; Saif, Linda J.; Marthaler, Douglas; Esseili, Malak A.; Meulia, Tea; Lin, Chun-Ming; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Jung, Kwonil; Zhang, Yan; Wang, Qiuhong","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14ad8c01995b0557849843c1a4971314e31f37c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126216.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113514003885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217400/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113514003885; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.08.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Canada","Mexico"],"keyphrases":["isolation of PEDV","PEDV immunoassays","PEDV antivirals","biology of PEDV","virulent US PEDV strains","diverse US PEDV strains","US S INDEL PEDV strain","Representative strains","novel strain","N-terminal S protein region","cell culture","deletion","study","deadly porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","nursing piglets","high mortality","Mexico","inactivation assays","screen","supplemental trypsin","therapeutic tools","significant economic losses","Vero cells","efficacious preventive measures","Canada","step","report","genomic sequence analysis","attenuated vaccine","6log10 plaque","development","genetic groups","titers","units","knowledge","primer"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak of the disease has been acknowledged by World Health Organization as Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The threat of Ebola in West Africa is still a major setback to the socioeconomic development. Optimal control theory is applied to a system of ordinary differential equations which is modeling Ebola infection through three different routes including contact between humans and a dead body. In an attempt to reduce infection in susceptible population, a preventive control is put in the form of education and campaign and two treatment controls are applied to infected and late-stage infected (super) human population. The Pontryagins maximum principle is employed to characterize optimality control, which is then solved numerically. It is observed that time optimal control is existed in the model. The activation of each control showed a positive reduction of infection. The overall effect of activation of all the controls simultaneously reduced the effort required for the reduction of the infection quickly. The obtained results present a good framework for planning and designing cost-effective strategies for good interventions in dealing with Ebola disease. It is established that in order to reduce Ebola threat all the three controls must be taken into consideration concurrently.","publish_time":"2016-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonyah, Ebenezer; Badu, Kingsley; Asiedu-Addo, Samuel Kwesi","journal":"Asian Pac J Trop Biomed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103935.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289024/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apjtb.2016.01.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2221169116301599; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2221169116301599","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["Ebola infection","Ebola disease","threat of Ebola","Ebola threat","preventive control","Ebola virus","optimality control","Optimal control theory","time optimal control","positive reduction of infection","treatment controls","good framework","good interventions","susceptible population","human population","World Health Organization","overall effect of activation","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","contact","planning","cost-effective strategies","major setback","humans","West Africa","different routes","system of ordinary differential equations","fatal illness","late-stage","campaign","form of education","obtained results","case fatality","socioeconomic development","dead body","Pontryagins maximum principle","attempt","effort","model","order","outbreak","consideration"],"language":"en"},

The debate involves the mode of transmission of a simian virus (SIV) to humans. Both major camps in the argument presume that humans are normally free of such viruses and assume that once the simian virus was transmitted, it immediately infected some T-cells and caused the release of toxic agents that killed off bystander (uninfected) T-cells resulting in AIDS. The evolution of the Simian virus (SIV) into a human virus (HIV) is regarded as an artifact. In contrast, a fundamentally different hypothesis has been proposed [Parris GE. Med Hypotheses 2004;62(3):354\u20137] in which it is presumed that in hyper-endemic areas of malaria (central Africa), all primates (humans and non-human primates) have shared a retrovirus that augments their T-cell response to the malaria parasite. The virus can be called \u201Cprimate T-cell retrovirus\u201D (PTRV). Over thousands of years the virus has crossed species lines many times (with little effect) and typically adapts to the host quickly. In this model, AIDS is seen to be the result of the development of resistance of the virus (PTRV) to continuous exposure to pro-apoptotic (schizonticidal) aminoquinoline drugs used to prevent malaria. The hypothesis was originally proposed based on biochemical activities of the aminoquinolines (e.g., pamaquine (plasmoquine(TM)), primaquine and chloroquine), but recent publications demonstrated that some of these drugs definitely adversely affect HIV and other viruses and logically would cause them to evolve resistance. Review of the timeline that has been created for the evolution of HIV in humans is also shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with this hypothesis (and not with either version of the conventional hypothesis). SARS and Ebola also fit this pattern.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parris, George E.","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b66b82e82283dc3efb41c57d28fc86900ee6124a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130596.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987706004476; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987706004476","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["simian virus","human virus","humans","T-cells","AIDS","different hypothesis","evolution of HIV","conventional hypothesis","T-cell response","primate T-cell retrovirus","SIV","PTRV","malaria parasite","viruses","non-human primates","hyper-endemic areas of malaria","aminoquinoline drugs","development of resistance","schizonticidal","continuous exposure","central Africa","scientific community","bystander","immune disorder syndrome","mode of transmission","aminoquinolines","chloroquine","plasmoquine","primaquine","TM","origin","release of toxic agents","argument","times","species","subject of substantial controversy","pamaquine","popular press","Summary","recent publications","result","version","little effect","biochemical activities","major camps","Parris GE","thousands of years","SARS","Ebola","pattern","debate","contrast","Med Hypotheses","Review","timeline","model","artifact","host"],"language":"en"},

Lipoxygenases form a family of lipid peroxidizing enzymes and human lipoxygenase isoforms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory, hyperproliferative (cancer) and neurodegenerative diseases. Lipoxygenases are not restricted to humans but also occur in a large number of pro- and eucaryotic organisms. Lipoxygenase-like sequences have been identified in the three domains of life (bacteria, archaea, eucarya) but because of lacking functional data the occurrence of catalytically active lipoxygenases in archaea still remains an open question. Although the physiological and/or pathophysiological functions of various lipoxygenase isoforms have been studied throughout the last three decades there is no unifying concept for the biological importance of these enzymes. In this review we are summarizing the current knowledge on the distribution of lipoxygenases in living single and multicellular organisms with particular emphasis to higher vertebrates and will also focus on the genetic diversity of enzymes and receptors involved in human leukotriene signaling.","publish_time":"2015-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horn, Thomas; Adel, Susan; Schumann, Ralf; Sur, Saubashya; Kakularam, Kumar Reddy; Polamarasetty, Aparoy; Redanna, Pallu; Kuhn, Hartmut; Heydeck, Dagmar","journal":"Progress in Lipid Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/baecbdea355092b3c4c4962648809a7118c9fc28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112624.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plipres.2014.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25435097/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163782714000605; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163782714000605","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human lipoxygenase isoforms","active lipoxygenases","distribution of lipoxygenases","lipoxygenase pathway","archaea","pathophysiological functions of various lipoxygenase isoforms","family of lipid peroxidizing enzymes","pro-inflammatory lipid mediators","genetic diversity of enzymes","multicellular organisms","eucaryotic organisms","pathogenesis of inflammatory","human leukotriene","large number of pro-","particular emphasis","hyperproliferative","cancer","eucarya","receptors","occurrence","Abstract Leukotrienes","functional data","higher vertebrates","unifying concept","bacteria","biological importance","current knowledge","arachidonic acid cascade","domains of life","neurodegenerative diseases","open question","decades","review","humans","sequences"],"language":"en"},

Catheter ablation represents a suitable therapeutic approach. However, the exact localization of the origin can be challenging, especially in cases of low PB burden during the procedure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an automated mapping algorithm on the basis of the hypothesis that mathematical optimization would significantly accelerate the localization of earliest activation. METHODS: The algorithm is based on iterative regression analyses. When acquiring local activation times (LATs) within a 3-dimensional anatomic map of the corresponding heart chamber, this algorithm is able to identify that exact position where a next LAT measurement adds maximum information about the predicted site of origin. Furthermore, on the basis of the acquired LAT measurements, the algorithm is able to predict earliest activation with high accuracy. RESULTS: A systematic retrospective analysis of the mapping performance comparing the operator with simulated search processes by the algorithm within 17 electroanatomic maps of focal spreading arrhythmias revealed a highly significant reduction of necessary LAT measurements from 55 \u00B1 8.8 to 10 \u00B1 0.51 (n = 17; P \u003C .0001). CONCLUSION: On the basis of mathematical optimization, we developed an algorithm that is able to reduce the number of LAT measurements necessary to locate the site of earliest activation. This algorithm might significantly accelerate the mapping procedure by guiding the operator to the optimal position for the next LAT measurement. Furthermore, the algorithm would be able to predict the site of origin with high accuracy early during the mapping procedure.","publish_time":"2017-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weber, Tobias; Katus, Hugo A.; Sager, Sebastian; Scholz, Eberhard P.","journal":"Heart Rhythm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50574a335111531f99e850854c30220630d96108.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5446561.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279745/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.03.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527117302941; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1547527117302941","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["automated mapping algorithm","mapping procedure","site of earliest activation","acquired LAT measurements","localization of earliest activation","number of LAT measurements necessary","mapping performance","significant reduction of necessary LAT measurements","predicted site of origin","basis of mathematical optimization","operator","high accuracy","exact position","exact localization","local activation times","optimal position","corresponding heart chamber","structural heart disease","electroanatomic maps of focal spreading arrhythmias","maximum information","simulated search processes","PBs","common finding","patients","dimensional anatomic map","systematic retrospective analysis","Catheter ablation","suitable therapeutic approach","study","LATs","hypothesis","cases of low PB burden","Premature beats","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","iterative regression analyses","healthy individuals","OBJECTIVE","aim","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, two CCoV-IIb strains were detected in the faeces and internal organs of two puppies, which died after presenting gastrointestinal symptoms. Mixed infection of both subtypes (CCoV-IIa/IIb) was detected in the faeces, while only CCoV-IIb was detected in the organs. Puppies were also infected by canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2). Both CCoV-IIb strains were isolated on cell cultures and subjected to sequence analysis and phylogeny.

These cases represent the first description of tissue distribution and quantitation of CCoV-IIb strains, detected in the organs. The detection of CCoV-IIa strains, which is restricted to the faeces, suggests that CCoV-IIb strains may have an advantage in disseminating throughout a dog with CPV-2 coinfection, in contrast to common enteric CCoV-IIa strains.","publish_time":"2011-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ntafis, V.; Mari, V.; Decaro, N.; Papanastassopoulou, M.; Papaioannou, N.; Mpatziou, R.; Buonavoglia, C.; Xylouri, E.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4b90168c0b7332adb26bd6177eb5238e2ea865f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117396.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21481551/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113511001465; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113511001465","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCoV type","CCoV-IIb strains","quantitation of CCoV","detection of CCoV","common enteric CCoV-IIa strains","different CCoV genotypes","canine parvovirus type","faeces","strains of potential recombinant origin","gastrointestinal infection","Abstract Canine coronavirus","CPV","puppies","internal organs","description of tissue distribution","Mixed infection","gastrointestinal symptoms","real time RT-PCR assays","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","enveloped RNA virus","quantitation of viral loads","contrast","coinfection","cell cultures","subtypes","sequence analysis","TGEV","present study","place","dogs","date","advantage","new subtype","phylogeny","cases","order"],"language":"en"},

Cats that are infected with FeLV may develop a progressive infection resulting in persistent viremia, immunodeficiency, tumors, anemia and death. A significant number of cats mount a protective immune response that suppresses viremia; these cats develop a regressive infection characterized by the absence of viral replication and the presence of low levels of proviral DNA. The biological importance of these latter provirus carriers is largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that ten cats that received a transfusion of blood from aviremic provirus carriers developed active FeLV infections, some with a progressive outcome and the development of fatal FeLV-associated disease. The infection outcome, disease spectrum and evolution into FeLV-C in one cat mirrored those of natural infection. Two cats developed persistent antigenemia; six cats were transiently antigenemic. Reactivation of infection occurred in some cats. One recipient developed non-regenerative anemia associated with FeLV-C, and four others developed a T-cell lymphoma, one with secondary lymphoblastic leukemia. Five of the ten recipient cats received provirus-positive aviremic blood, whereas the other five received provirus- and viral RNA-positive but aviremic blood. Notably, the cats that received blood containing only proviral DNA exhibited a later onset but graver outcome of FeLV infection than the cats that were transfused with blood containing proviral DNA and viral RNA. Leukocyte counts and cytokine analyses indicated that the immune system of the latter cats reacted quicker and more efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underline the biological and epidemiological relevance of FeLV provirus carriers and the risk of inadvertent FeLV transmission via blood transfusion and demonstrate the replication capacity of proviral DNA if uncontrolled by the immune system. Our results have implications not only for veterinary medicine, such as the requirement for testing blood donors and blood products for FeLV provirus by sensitive polymerase chain reaction, but are also of general interest by revealing the importance of latent retroviral DNA in infected hosts. When aiming to eliminate a retroviral infection from a population, provirus carriers must be considered.

Intense livestock production, increased travel, and changing climate have increased the risk of catastrophic animal losses due to infectious diseases. In the event of an outbreak, it is essential to properly manage the infected animals to prevent the spread of diseases. The most common disposal methods used during a disease outbreak include burial, landfilling, incineration and composting. Biosecurity, transportation logistics, public perception, and environmental concerns limit the use of some of these methods. During a disease outbreak, the large number of mortalities often exceeds the capacity of local rendering plants and landfills. Transporting mortalities to disposal and incineration facilities outside the production operation introduces biosecurity risks. Burying mortalities is limited by the size and availability of suitable sites and it has the risk of pathogen survival and contamination of groundwater and soil. Portable incinerators are expensive and have the potential to aerosolize infectious particles. Composting, on the other hand, has been recognized as a biosecure disposal method. Research showed that it eliminates bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157: H7, Salmonella spp., as well as viruses including highly pathogenic avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, Newcastle disease, and porcine epidemic diarrhea. This paper summarizes the lessons learned during the major animal disease outbreaks including the 2010 foot-and-mouth disease, 2016 highly pathogenic avian influenza, and recent African swine fever outbreaks. The purpose of this review is to critically discuss the biosecurity of composting as a mortality disposal method during the outbreaks of infectious animal diseases.","publish_time":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costa, Tiago; Akdeniz, Neslihan","journal":"Waste Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1178547f0f3f3210bba43f69c6a79189129dc2b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126724.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X19302600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088667/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956053X19302600; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.04.047","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouth disease","major animal disease outbreaks","outbreaks of infectious animal diseases","Newcastle disease","infectious diseases","biosecurity of composting","animal health","biosecurity risks","spread of diseases","mortality disposal method","biosecure disposal method","common disposal methods","risk of catastrophic animal losses","pathogenic avian influenza","foot","infectious particles","application of rigorous biosecurity measures","large number of mortalities","production operation","incineration facilities","increased travel","recent African swine fever outbreaks","risk of pathogen survival","Intense livestock production","continuing threat","food safety","Escherichia coli O157","public perception","national economy","bacterial pathogens","Salmonella","development of new vaccines","capacity of local rendering plants","burial","landfilling","environmental concerns","contamination of groundwater","transportation logistics","porcine epidemic diarrhea","landfills","H7","potential","size","climate","viruses","lessons","availability of suitable sites","infected animals","soil","Abstract","Portable incinerators","Research","review","purpose","paper","hand","event"],"language":"en"},

Here we review evidence-based management of this common disease in order to optimize resource utilization, decrease healthcare costs, and decrease unnecessary hospitalization. Current evidence does not support the routine use of chest radiographs, viral testing or laboratory evaluation in children with bronchiolitis. In addition, routine administration of bronchodilators, including albuterol and nebulized epinephrine, corticosteroids and hypertonic saline are not recommended for infants and children with bronchiolitis. Intravenous or nasogastric hydration and nutritional support, supplemental oxygen, and respiratory support are recommended. Standardization of bronchiolitis care with evidence based institutional clinical pathways spanning ED to inpatient care can help optimize resource utilization while simultaneously improving care of bronchiolitis and reducing hospital length of stays and costs.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cahill, Amie A.; Cohen, Joanna","journal":"Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab1d784d27adf305fd189abf1a074d758a67b14a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106168.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288646/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S152284011830003X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S152284011830003X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpem.2018.02.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ED"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["care of bronchiolitis","Standardization of bronchiolitis care","Abstract Bronchiolitis","inpatient care","supportive care","use of pharmacotherapies","routine use of chest radiographs","use of therapeutic interventions","resource utilization","infants","widespread use of non-recommended therapies","nutritional support","Current evidence","evidence-based management","respiratory support","children","Clinical guidelines","healthcare costs","cause of hospitalization","unnecessary hospitalization","institutional clinical pathways","routine administration of bronchodilators","viral testing","variation","supplemental oxygen","laboratory evaluation","nebulized epinephrine","albuterol","common disease","nasogastric hydration","corticosteroids","hypertonic saline","hospitals","order","number","hospital length of stays","United States","addition"],"language":"en"},

The captured receptor protein was then stabilized on the chip surface by limited cross-linking. The resulting chip surface retained ligand binding activity and was used for monoclonal antibody kinetics assays by a standard Biacore kinetics assay method with a simple low pH regeneration step.

Individuals with either cystic fibrosis related bronchiectasis (CFRB) or noncystic fibrosis related bronchiectasis (NCFRB) experience continuous airway inflammation and suffer airway architectural changes that foster the acquisition of a unique polymicrobial community. The presence of microorganisms increases airway inflammation, triggers pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), reduces quality of life (QOL), and, in some cases, is an independent risk factor for increased mortality. As there is no cure for either condition, prevention and control of infection is paramount.

In pursuit of this strategy, most attention has been paid to electric cars. However, substantial, yet untapped, potentials could be realized in urban areas through the large-scale introduction of electric two-wheelers. Here, we review the environmental, economic, and social performance of electric two-wheelers, demonstrating that these are generally more energy efficient and less polluting than conventionally-powered motor vehicles. Electric two-wheelers tend to decrease exposure to pollution as their environmental impacts largely result from vehicle production and electricity generation outside of urban areas. Our analysis suggests that the price of e-bikes has been decreasing at a learning rate of 8%. Despite price differentials of 5000\u00B11800EUR2012 kWh\u22121 in Europe, e-bikes are penetrating the market because they appear to offer an apparent additional use value relative to bicycles. Mid-size and large electric two-wheelers do not offer such an additional use value compared to their conventional counterparts and constitute niche products at price differentials of 700\u00B1360EUR2012 kW\u22121 and 160\u00B190EUR2012 kW\u22121, respectively. The large-scale adoption of electric two-wheelers can reduce traffic noise and road congestion but may necessitate adaptations of urban infrastructure and safety regulations. A case-specific assessment as part of an integrated urban mobility planning that accounts, e.g., for the local electricity mix, infrastructure characteristics, and mode-shift behavior, should be conducted before drawing conclusions about the sustainability impacts of electric two-wheelers.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weiss, Martin; Dekker, Peter; Moro, Alberto; Scholz, Harald; Patel, Martin K.","journal":"Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cd0f74020b0db181c3df1388d777739871989b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108350.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2015.09.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288595/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920915001315; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1361920915001315","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["large electric two-wheelers","sustainability impacts of electric two-wheelers","large-scale introduction of electric two-wheelers","large-scale adoption of electric two-wheelers","electric cars","social performance of electric two-wheelers","urban areas","price differentials","price of e","adaptations of urban infrastructure","environmental impacts of road transportation","integrated urban mobility","e-bikes","apparent additional use value relative","infrastructure characteristics","road congestion","electricity generation","viable strategy","local electricity mix","oil dependency","conventional counterparts","vehicle production","traffic noise","niche products","bicycles","exposure","1800EUR2012 kWh","mode-shift behavior","accounts","Europe","potentials","safety regulations","attention","Mid-size","pollution","powered motor vehicles","case-specific assessment","conclusions","energy efficient","pursuit","market","360EUR2012","analysis","Abstract Electrification","learning rate","90EUR2012"],"language":"en"},

To examine whether germline rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region genes could be used as source of antibody repertoire, an immunized phage-displayed scFv library was prepared using splenocytic genomic DNA as template. In addition, a novel frame-shifting PCR (fsPCR) step was introduced to rescue stop codon and to enhance diversity of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3). The germline scFv library was initially characterized against the hapten antigen phenyloxazolone (phOx). Sequence analysis of the phOx-selective scFvs indicated that the CDRs consisted of novel as well as conserved motifs. In order to illustrate that the diversity of CDR3 was increased by the fsPCR step, a second scFv library was constructed using a single scFv clone L3G7C as a template. Despite showing similar binding characteristics towards phOx, the scFv clones that were obtained from the L3G7C-derived antibody library gave a lower non-specific binding than that of the parental L3G7C clone. To determine whether germline library represented the endogenous immune status, specific scFv clones for nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SCoV) were obtained both from na\u00EFve and immunized germline scFv libraries. Both libraries yielded specific anti-N scFvs that exhibited similar binding characteristics towards recombinant N protein, except the immunized library gave a larger number of specific anti-N scFv, and clones with identical nucleotide sequences were found. In conclusion, highly diversified antibody library can be efficiently constructed using germline rearranged immunoglobulin variable genes as source of antibody repertoires and fsPCR to diversify the CDR3.","publish_time":"2011-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Man; Chan, Shirley Y.

(1986) J. Virol. 57, 328\u2013334). In the present study, the fate of the residual genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide was determined. Nearly all of the genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of drug was incorporated into nucleocapsid structures, suggesting that even in the absence of protein synthesis, genomic RNA synthesis and encapsidation are coupled in MHV-infected cells. Sufficient free nucleocapsid N protein was available for this purpose, since the pool of soluble N protein was determined to decay with a half-life of approximately one hour. Negative strand RNA is the template for the synthesis of both genomic and subgenomic positive strand RNA, and would be predicted to accumulate primarily during the early phases of the lytic cycle. In agreement with this prediction, negative strand RNA accumulated during the first 5\u20136 h of infection, with little additional accumulation occurring over the next 2.5 h. In marked contrast, positive strand RNA increased 5\u20136-fold over the same 2.5 h period. These results, taken in conjunction with published data, suggest that negative strand RNA is synthesized during the early period of the infectious cycle and is stable in infected cells and also suggest that treatment with cycloheximide at late times does not inhibit positive strand RNA synthesis indirectly by blocking the formation of negative strand templates.","publish_time":"1986-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perlman, Stanley; Ries, Dana; Bolger, Eric; Lung-Ji, Chang; Stoltzfus, C.Martin","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de83e4cc03996e29abbe29c7ea33347b320913bc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170286900742; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170286900742","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["J.

Given the high rate of horizontal gene transfer among viruses and their hosts, it is an open question as to how representative particular genes are of the evolutionary history of the complete genome. To address the concerted evolution of viral genes, we compared genomic evolution across four distinct, extant viral families. For all four viral families we constructed DNA-dependent DNA polymerase-based (DdDp) phylogenies and in addition, whole genome sequence, as quantitative descriptions of inter-genome relationships. We found that the history of the polymerase gene was highly predictive of the history of the genome as a whole, which we explain in terms of repeated, co-divergence events of the core DdDp gene accompanied by a number of satellite, accessory genetic loci. We also found that the rate of gene gain in baculovirus and poxviruses proceeds significantly more quickly than the rate of gene loss and that there is convergent acquisition of satellite functions promoting contextual adaptation when distinct viral families infect related hosts. The congruence of the genome and polymerase trees suggests that a large set of viral genes, including polymerase, derive from a phylogenetically conserved core of genes of host origin, secondarily reinforced by gene acquisition from common hosts or co-infecting viruses within the host. A single viral genome can be thought of as a mutualistic network, with the core genes acting as an effective host and the satellite genes as effective symbionts. Larger virus genomes show a greater departure from linkage equilibrium between core and satellites functions.","publish_time":"2008-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zanotto, Paolo Marinho de Andrade; Krakauer, David C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38fe59161b046f7f5a6dfadbcc10b9031d21f1ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2567038.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18941535/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003500","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["core genes","polymerase gene","single viral genome","satellite genes","concerted evolution of viral genes","distinct viral families","gene acquisition","core DdDp gene","extant viral families","large set of viral genes","conserved core of genes","concerted evolution of viral genomes","genome sequence","complete genome","families of DNA viruses","rate of gene gain","rate of gene loss","DNA-dependent DNA polymerase","representative particular genes","effective host","polymerase trees","high rate of horizontal gene transfer","number of satellite","convergent acquisition of satellite functions","co-infecting viruses","common hosts","related hosts","host origin","genomic evolution","quantitative descriptions of inter-genome relationships","evolutionary history","satellites functions","effective symbionts","co-divergence events","Larger virus genomes","contextual adaptation","greater departure","linkage equilibrium","open question","terms of repeated","accessory genetic loci","addition","baculovirus","phylogenies","poxviruses","congruence","mutualistic network"],"language":"en"},

Study Two KIV (KI-A and KI-B) and three WUV (WU-A, WU-B and WU-C) real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) assays were developed and evaluated. Clinical sensitivities and specificities were determined by testing 200 respiratory specimens and the results compared to those for previously described conventional PCR assays. Limits of detection were determined, and the analytical specificities of the assays were investigated. Results No cross-reactivity was observed between the rtPCR methods and unrelated organisms. All five rtPCR assays could reliably detect 10 copies of genomic DNA equivalents per reaction, which was more sensitive than conventional methods. Compared to the conventional PCR assays, the sensitivity of the KI-A, KI-B, WU-A, WU-B and WU-C assays was 100%, 86.7% 95.5%, 100% and 100%, respectively. Specificity was 94.6%, 97.3%, 96.6%, 97.7% and 97.2%, respectively.

Targeted detection methods have a limited ability to detect unknown viruses and often provide insufficient data to detect coinfections or identify antigenic variants. Random, deep sequencing is a method that can more fully detect and characterize RNA viruses and is often coupled with molecular techniques or culture methods for viral enrichment. Viral culture coupled with third-generation sequencing were tested for the ability to detect and characterize RNA viruses. Cultures of bovine viral diarrhea virus, canine distemper virus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, two influenza A viruses, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus were sequenced on the MinION platform using a random, reverse primer in a strand-switching reaction, coupled with PCR-based barcoding. Reads were taxonomically classified and used for reference-based sequence building using a stock personal computer. This method accurately detected and identified complete coding sequence genomes with a minimum of 20\u00D7 coverage depth for all seven viruses, including a sample containing two viruses. Each lineage-typing region had at least 26\u00D7 coverage depth for all viruses. Furthermore, analyzing the canine distemper virus sample through a pipeline devoid of canine distemper virus reference sequences modeled the ability of this protocol to detect unknown viruses.

This policy approach is grounded in the knowledge that approximately 70 percent of emerging diseases in humans originate from other species, and that this species crossover is precipitated by stresses to environmental systems such as habitat change and biodiversity loss. Remote sensing tools apply well to this approach due to the multitude of variables that can be measured across borders in real-time. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of using satellite remote sensing to monitor biodiversity loss in real time, with a goal of predictive surveillance for emerging disease events. Key findings include that (1) certain emerging disease events are preceded by biodiversity changes that can be observed from space; (2) refining quantitative assessments of biodiversity loss is a critical next step; and (3) biodiversity loss as observed from space merits inclusion in emerging disease surveillance programs as a complement to in situ and epidemiological surveillance data.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malloy, Samuel S.; Horack, John M.; Lee, Jiyoung; Newton, Elizabeth K.","journal":"Acta Astronautica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de36857b220e50ff58ec26a8b0b7877043633332.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112290.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576518302479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287491/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0094576518302479; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.10.042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging disease surveillance programs","emerging concept","biodiversity changes","certain emerging disease events","quantitative assessments of biodiversity loss","environmental health","percent of emerging diseases","health sciences","goal of predictive surveillance","epidemiological surveillance data","satellite remote sensing","Remote sensing tools","environmental systems","species crossover","policy approach","space merits inclusion","complement","animal","habitat change","situ","opportunities","stresses","real time","challenges","knowledge","humans","step","single framework","multitude of variables","borders","paper","Key findings"],"language":"en"},

A wide range of viral and bacterial clinical infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract can occur during the Hajj, leading to a high number of outpatient consultations and hospitalization in Saudi hospitals.

Policy efforts are now being directed towards a global target of zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 and the global elimination of canine rabies. Here we demonstrate how research provides a cause for optimism as to the feasibility of these goals through strategies based around mass dog vaccination. We summarize some of the pragmatic insights generated from rabies epidemiology and dog ecology research that can improve the design of dog vaccination strategies in low- and middle-income countries and which should encourage implementation without further delay. We also highlight the need for realism in reaching the feasible, although technically more difficult and longer-term goal of global elimination of canine rabies.

We selected five mAbs that could be used in various diagnostic assays, and all of these mAbs recognized linear epitopes. Three IgG2b mAbs were recognized within the N-terminus of N protein, whereas the epitope of two IgG1 mAbs localized within the C-terminus. These mAbs were found to have significant reactivity with both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated N proteins, which resulted in high reactivity with native N protein in virus-infected cells; however, they did not show cross-reactivity with human coronavirus.

Whole genome bioinformatics analysis suggests that nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) is a 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP), responsible for most of the nonstructural protein processing. The gene encoding this protease was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli in order to confirm this prediction. The purified protein was crystallized, and the structure was solved at 1.9 \u00C5 resolution. In addition, the crystal structure of the Ser118Ala mutant was determined at 2.0 \u00C5 resolution. The monomeric enzyme folds into three domains, similar to that of the homologous protease of equine arteritis virus, which, like PRRSV, is a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order of Nidovirales. The active site of the PRRSV 3CLSP is located between domains I and II and harbors a canonical catalytic triad comprising Ser118, His39, and Asp64. The structure also shows an atypical oxyanion hole and a partially collapsed S1 specificity pocket. The proteolytic activity of the purified protein was assessed in vitro. Three sites joining nonstructural protein domains in the PRRSV replicative polyprotein are confirmed to be processed by the enzyme. Two of them, the nsp3/nsp4 and nsp11/nsp12 junctions, are shown to be cleaved in trans, while cis cleavage is demonstrated for the nsp4/nsp5 linker. Thus, we provide structural evidence as well as enzymatic proof of the nsp4 protein being a functional 3CLSP. We also show that the enzyme has a strong preference for glutamic acid at the P1 position of the substrate.","publish_time":"2009-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Xinsheng; Lu, Guangwen; Gao, Feng; Peng, Hao; Feng, Youjun; Ma, Guangpeng; Bartlam, Mark; Tian, Kegong; Yan, Jinghua; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Gao, George F.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b523342a9fc5a2cac149d1c8723bba2e5aea6e17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094510.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19646449/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283609009292; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283609009292; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.07.062","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nsp4 protein","nonstructural protein domains","purified protein","nonstructural protein processing","CLSP","PRRSV replicative polyprotein","serine protease","crystal structure","\u00C5 resolution","monomeric enzyme folds","crucial step of replicative polyprotein processing","homologous protease of equine arteritis virus","order of Nidovirales","respiratory syndrome virus","glutamic acid","self-encoded proteases","His39","replication","atypical oxyanion hole","enzymatic proof","P1 position","collapsed S1 specificity pocket","strong preference","Ser118Ala mutant","canonical catalytic triad","family Arteriviridae","nsp11","genome bioinformatics analysis","Summary Biogenesis","nsp12 junctions","structural evidence","Escherichia coli","cis cleavage","nsp3","member","proteolytic activity","active site","sites","trans","substrate","Asp64","prediction","addition","nsp5 linker"],"language":"en"},

Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (R(o)) of the pathogen. The most notable example is rabies. When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host\u2019s central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression. The virus is also present in the rabid animal\u2019s saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated. Toxoplasmosis is another example. When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten. Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive. Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen. Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission. Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barton, Michael C.; Bennett, Kaylee V.; Cook, John R.; Gallup, Gordon G.; Platek, Steven M.","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa406561ef608d6c9b732dcac2ac504c5a33f91f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175891.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720305727?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720305727; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388138/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new host","old host","behavioral host manipulation","similar host manipulations","Toxoplasmosis","rabies virus","humans","transmission","common influenza virus","behavioral changes","notable example","host\u2019s central nervous system","hyper aggression","hour incubation period","reproduction","disease","exposure","various pathogens","process","SARS-CoV2","obvious vector","novel coronavirus","COVID","digestive tract","adaptations","infection","rabid animal\u2019s saliva","person sociality","Recent studies","fearlessness","cats","feline","cat feces","mice","chances","spread"],"language":"en"},

We aim to model the impact of PCR testing into resuming endoscopy practice. Methods We performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches\u2015Strategy 1: endoscopy for urgent indications only; Strategy 2: testing for semi-urgent indications; and Strategy 3: testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence, and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed/cancelled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from literature. Results During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategy 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semi-urgent and elective cases. Investing 22USD and 105USD in testing per patient allowed completing 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies respectively. False negative results were seen after testing 4,700 patients (or 3 months applying Strategy 2 in our practice). Implementing PCR testing over 1 week in United States would require 13 and 64 million USD, with a return of 165 and 767 million USD to providers, leaving 65 and 325 health care workers infected. Conclusion PCR testing is an effective strategy to restart endoscopic practice in United States. PCR screening should be implemented during the second phase of the pandemic, once the healthcare system is able to test and isolate all suspected COVID-19 cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corral, Juan E.; Hoogenboom, Sanne A.; Kr\u00F6ner, Paul T.; Vazquez-Roque, Maria I.; Picco, Michael F.; Farraye, Francis A.; Wallace, Michael B.","journal":"Gastrointest Endosc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6dc956bbbe0f57a6e3b6de69f7df9a9352971ab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360302/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016510720342486; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016510720342486?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.049","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["testing accuracy","impact of PCR testing","Conclusion PCR testing","effective strategy","pandemic","USD","endoscopy volume","resuming endoscopy practice","suspected COVID","current COVID","retrospective review of endoscopy utilization","PCR screening","semi-urgent indications","endoscopic practice","United States","Disease prevalence","projected prevalence","patients","direct costs","effective interventions","significant health","Secondary outcomes","Primary outcomes","elective cases","personnel infected","computer model","baseline reference","baseline endoscopies","health care workers","False negative results","reimbursement","personal protective equipment","approaches","week","economic losses","number of procedures","healthcare system","months","Methods","Abstract Background","Analysis","providers","return","literature","phase"],"language":"en"},

We resolve different protein layers within individual HSV-1 particles using multi-colour dSTORM imaging and discriminate envelope-anchored glycoproteins from tegument proteins, both in purified virions and in virions present in infected cells. Precise characterization of HSV-1 structure was achieved by particle averaging of purified viruses and model-based analysis of the radial distribution of the tegument proteins VP16, VP1/2 and pUL37, and envelope protein gD.

However, little work has been done measuring and interpreting stress hormones in flying-foxes. Over a 12-month period, we collected pooled urine samples from underneath roosting flying-foxes, and urine and blood samples from captured individuals. Urine and plasma samples were assayed for cortisol using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay. We demonstrated a typical post-capture stress response in flying-foxes, established urine specific gravity as an attractive alternative to creatinine to correct urine concentration, and established population-level urinary cortisol ranges (and geometric means) for the four Australian species: Pteropus alecto 0.5\u2013305.1 ng/mL (20.1 ng/mL); Pteropus conspicillatus 0.3\u2013370.9 ng/mL (18.9 ng/mL); Pteropus poliocephalus 0.3\u2013311.3 ng/mL (10.1 ng/mL); Pteropus scapulatus 5.2\u2013205.4 ng/mL (40.7 ng/mL).

NNPD affects piglets during the first week of life and results in impaired welfare, decreased weight gain, and in the worst-case scenario death. Commonly used preventative interventions such as vaccination or treatment with antibiotics, have a limited effect on NNPD. Previous studies have investigated the clinical manifestations, histopathology, and to some extent, microbiological findings; however, these studies were either inconclusive or suggested that Enterococci, possibly in interaction with Escherichia coli, contribute to the aetiology of NNPD. This study examined ileal and colonic luminal contents of 50 control piglets and 52 NNPD piglets by means of the qPCR-based Gut Microbiotassay and 16 samples by 454 sequencing to study the composition of the bacterial gut microbiota in relation to NNPD. RESULTS: NNPD was associated with a diminished quantity of bacteria from the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes while genus Enterococcus was more than 24 times more abundant in diarrhoeic piglets. The number of bacteria from the phylum Fusobacteria was also doubled in piglets suffering from diarrhoea. With increasing age, the gut microbiota of NNPD affected piglet and control piglets became more diverse. Independent of diarrhoeic status, piglets from first parity sows (gilts) possessed significantly more bacteria from family Enterobacteriaceae and species E. coli, and fewer bacteria from phylum Firmicutes. Piglets born to gilts had 25 times higher odds of having NNPD compared with piglets born to multiparous sows. Finally, the co-occurrence of genus Enterococcus and species E. coli contributed to the risk of having NNPD. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support previous findings that points towards genus Enterococcus and species E. coli to be involved in the pathogenesis of NNPD. Moreover, the results indicate that NNPD is associated with a disturbed bacterial composition and larger variation between the diarrhoeic piglets.

The strength of this system is illustrated by the fact that, despite some temporary discomfort like a common cold or diarrhea, most viral infections will not cause major harm to the healthy immunocompetent host. To achieve this, the immune system is equipped with a wide array of pattern recognition receptors and the subsequent coordinated type I IFN response orchestrated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). The production of type I IFN subtypes by dendritic cells (DCs), but also other cells is crucial for the execution of many antiviral processes. Despite this coordinated response, morbidity and mortality are still common in viral disease due to the ability of viruses to exploit the weaknesses of the immune system. Viruses successfully evade immunity and infection can result in aberrant immune responses. However, these weaknesses also open opportunities for improvement via clinical interventions as can be seen in current vaccination and antiviral treatment programs. The application of IFNs, Toll\u2010like receptor ligands, DCs, and antiviral proteins is now being investigated to further limit viral infections. Unfortunately, a common threat during stimulation of immunity is the possible initiation or aggravation of autoimmunity. Also the translation from animal models to the human situation remains difficult.

Despite advances in understanding acute gastrointestinal infections, important issues concerning epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and control of most persistent digestive symptomatologies remain to be elucidated. Helminths and intestinal protozoa are considered to play major roles, but the full extent of the aetiologic spectrum is still unclear. We provide an overview of pathogens causing digestive disorders in the tropics and evaluate available reference tests. METHODS: We searched the literature to identify pathogens that might give rise to persistent diarrhoea, chronic abdominal pain and/or blood in the stool. We reviewed existing laboratory diagnostic methods for each pathogen and stratified them by (i) microscopy; (ii) culture techniques; (iii) immunological tests; and (iv) molecular methods. Pathogen-specific reference tests providing highest diagnostic accuracy are described in greater detail. RESULTS: Over 30 pathogens may cause persistent digestive disorders. Bacteria, viruses and parasites are important aetiologic agents of acute and long-lasting symptomatologies. An integrated approach, consisting of stool culture, microscopy and/or specific immunological techniques for toxin, antigen and antibody detection, is required for accurate diagnosis of bacteria and parasites. Molecular techniques are essential for sensitive diagnosis of many viruses, bacteria and intestinal protozoa, and are increasingly utilised as adjuncts for helminth identification. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of the broad spectrum of intestinal pathogens is often cumbersome. There is a need for rapid diagnostic tests that are simple and affordable for resource-constrained settings, so that the management of patients suffering from persistent digestive disorders can be improved.","publish_time":"2013-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Becker, S\u00F6ren L; Vogt, J\u00FCrg; Knopp, Stefanie; Panning, Marcus; Warhurst, David C; Polman, Katja; Marti, Hanspeter; von M\u00FCller, Lutz; Yansouni, Cedric P; Jacobs, Jan; Bottieau, Emmanuel; Sacko, Moussa; Rijal, Suman; Meyanti, Fransiska; Miles, Michael A; Boelaert, Marleen; Lutumba, Pascal; van Lieshout, Lisette; N\u2019Goran, Eli\u00E9zer K; Chappuis, Fran\u00E7ois; Utzinger, J\u00FCrg","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/426d73371e7f29a3d046687525d416f68708f643.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3579720.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23347408/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["persistent digestive symptomatologies","Persistent digestive disorders account","persistent diarrhoea","immunological tests","rapid diagnostic tests","accurate diagnosis of bacteria","sensitive diagnosis","Pathogen-specific reference tests","culture techniques","Molecular techniques","broad spectrum of intestinal pathogens","intestinal protozoa","overview of pathogens","molecular methods","specific immunological techniques","available reference tests","viruses","aetiologic spectrum","tropics","parasites","existing laboratory diagnostic methods","microscopy","stool culture","important aetiologic agents of acute","highest diagnostic accuracy","important issues","long-lasting symptomatologies","acute gastrointestinal infections","epidemiology","considerable disease burden","antigen","toxin","treatment","control","chronic abdominal pain","antibody detection","rise","resource-constrained settings","management of patients","blood","extent","BACKGROUND","major roles","advances","integrated approach","CONCLUSIONS","need","adjuncts","helminth identification","Helminths","literature","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Our analyses involving molecular phylogenetics is a step toward understanding the transmission clusters that can be correlated to pathophysiology of the disease to gain insight into virulence mechanism. As the infections are increasing rapidly, more divergence is expected followed possibly by viral adaptation. We could identify mutational hotspots which appear to be major drivers of diversity among strains, with RBD of spike protein emerging as the key region involved in interaction with ACE2 and consequently a major determinant of infection outcome. We believe that such molecular analyses correlated with clinical characteristics and host predisposition need to be evaluated at the earliest to understand viral adaptability, disease prognosis, and transmission dynamics.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheikh, Javaid Ahmad; Singh, Jasdeep; Singh, Hina; Jamal, Salma; Khubaib, Mohd.; Kohli, Sunil; Dobrindt, Ulrich; Rahman, Syed Asad; Ehtesham, Nasreen Zafar; Hasnain, Seyed Ehtesham","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ee0488ce59af4533cad65b4676c2e7dafa7eee9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7180377.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104330; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820301611?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335334/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820301611","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular analyses","role of molecular divergence","molecular phylogenetics","disease prognosis","clinical characteristics","viral adaptability","transmission clusters","transmission dynamics","viral adaptation","major drivers of diversity","major determinant of infection outcome","strains","key region","ACE2","step","RBD of spike protein","SARS-CoV","insight","time","interaction","host predisposition","pathophysiology","virulence mechanism","epidemiological concerns","mutational hotspots","current pandemic of COVID","infections"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated 15 children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children and adolescents from a single institution in Adana, Turkey. RESULTS: The patients presented in a seasonal distribution, with 73.3%: (11/15) presenting in winter or spring. The majority of patients (13/15, 86.7%) had a history of acute febrile illness 2 to 40 days before presentation, and five children had serologic evidence of specific triggers: mycoplasma (2 children), influenza-A (H1N1) (1 child), or Epstein-Barr virus. All children were treated with a standard protocol of 3 to 5 days of intravenous administration of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin for patients who continued to deteriorate. Oseltamivir and clarithromycin were administered in patients with influenza-A (H1N1) and mycoplasma according to the serology. In 13 patients, all neurologic signs and symptoms resolved after treatment. Only one patient was left with severe neurologic sequelae and another child had recurrent attacks and was ultimately diagnosed with possible multiple sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present series demonstrates that acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children occurs predominantly in winter or spring and often follows an upper respiratory tract illness for those along the southern coast of Anatolia (Mediterranean region). Early treatment with immunomodulative agents is recommended and is likely to result in a favorable outcome or full recovery. This study also suggests benefit from antiviral and antibiotic treatment initiated as soon as possible after the onset of illness.","publish_time":"2013-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Erol, Ilknur; \u00D6zkale, Yasemin; Alkan, \u00D6zlem; Alehan, Fusun","journal":"Pediatr Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94528b6c4b0ce8c5575bee83632dc19bcc13289b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23849604/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887899413002166; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2013.03.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887899413002166","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Turkey","Anatolia"],"keyphrases":["children","Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis","majority of patients","history of acute febrile illness","mycoplasma","antibiotic treatment","onset of illness","Early treatment","influenza","study","spring","H1N1","winter","days of intravenous administration of methylprednisolone","intravenous immunoglobulin","neurologic signs","upper respiratory tract illness","multiple inflammatory lesions","severe neurologic sequelae","possible multiple sclerosis","adolescents","immune-mediated disease","serologic evidence of specific triggers","southern coast of Anatolia","brain","single institution","present series","Mediterranean region","Adana","immunomodulative agents","recurrent attacks","benefit","symptoms","presentation","spinal cord","favorable outcome","Turkey","clarithromycin","standard protocol","BACKGROUND","Epstein-Barr virus","recovery","CONCLUSIONS","seasonal distribution","Oseltamivir","METHODS","serology","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This study is aimed to evaluate the impact of increased coverage of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines by comparing the change of disease burden in the older population of Hong Kong, with the burden in the older population of Brisbane with relatively high vaccine coverage in the past fifteen years. METHODS: Time series segmented regression models were applied to weekly numbers of cause-specific mortality or hospitalization of Hong Kong and Brisbane. Annual excess rates of mortality or hospitalization associated with influenza in the older population were estimated for the pre-SARS (reference period), post-SARS and post-pandemic period, respectively. The rate ratios (RRs) between these periods were also calculated to assess the relative change of disease burden. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-SARS period, excess rates of mortality associated with influenza during the post-SARS period in Hong Kong decreased for cardiorespiratory diseases (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.80, 1.01), stroke (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.50, 1.09), and ischemic heart diseases (RR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.34, 0.58). The corresponding RRs in Brisbane were 0.79 (95% CI 0.54, 1.15), 0.33 (0.13, 0.80), and 1.09 (0.62, 1.90), respectively. Only the mortality of ischemic heart diseases showed a greater reduction in Hong Kong than in Brisbane. During the post-pandemic period, excess rates of all-cause mortality increased in Hong Kong, but to a lesser extent than in Brisbane (RR = 1.41 vs 2.39). CONCLUSION: A relative decrease (or less of an increase) of influenza disease burden was observed in the older population of Hong Kong after increased coverage of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in this population, as compared to those of Brisbane where vaccination rates remained stable. The lack of significant findings in some disease categories highlights the challenges of evaluating the benefits of vaccination at the population level.

Most antiviral drugs on the market today target viral proteins. However, the more recent strategies involve targeting the host cell proteins or pathways that mediate viral replication. This new approach would be effective for most viruses while minimizing drug resistance and toxicity. METHODS: Cytomegalovirus replication, latency, and immune response are mediated by the intermediate early protein 2, the main protein that determines the effectiveness of drugs in cytomegalovirus inhibition. This review explains how intermediate early protein 2 can modify the action of cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive, and antiviral drug. It also links all the pathways mediated by cyclosporin A, cytomegalovirus replication, and its encoded proteins. RESULTS: Intermediate early protein 2 can influence the cellular cyclophilin A pathway, affecting cyclosporin A as a mediator of viral replication or anti-cytomegalovirus drug. CONCLUSION: Cyclosporin A has a dual function in cytomegalovirus pathogenesis. It has the immunosuppressive effect that establishes virus replication through the inhibition of T-cell function. It also has an anti-cytomegalovirus effect mediated by intermediate early protein 2. Both of these functions involve cyclophilin A pathway.","publish_time":"2018-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"A Abdullah, Ashwaq; Abdullah, Rasedee; A Nazariah, Zeenathul; N Balakrishnan, Krishnan; Firdaus J Abdullah, Faez; A Bala, Jamilu; Mohd-Lila, Mohd-Azmi","journal":"Antivir Chem Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fc9523915b057c03afa54f111fe9fd1995dd1ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6243413.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2040206618811413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30449131/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cytomegalovirus replication","intermediate early protein","cytomegalovirus inhibition","anti-cytomegalovirus drug","cytomegalovirus pathogenesis","viral proteins","anti-cytomegalovirus effect","main protein","mediator of viral replication","host cell proteins","action of cyclosporin","encoded proteins","Viruses","cell function","cellular cyclophilin","immunosuppressive effect","pathways","drug resistance","antiviral drugs","inhibition of T","cellular machinery","dual function","effectiveness of drugs","latency","immune response","obligate parasites","market","recent strategies","BACKGROUND","toxicity","METHODS","review","RESULTS","new approach","functions","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

BVD viruses are genetically highly variable. They are classified into two genetic species (BVDV-1 and -2) that are further divided into numerous subgroups, particularly for BVDV-1. The complexity of these viruses is also reflected in their interaction with the host animals. Infections are either transient or persistent and can cause a wide spectrum of clinical signs, from no or very mild disease to severe forms, reminiscent of viral haemorrhagic fevers. In this work, we have analysed the clinical signs and the pathology of BVD viral infections in a cattle population where different subgroups of BVDV-1 genotype viruses are endemic. In addition, we have examined potential virulence properties of BVDV-1 subgroups during persistent infection by comparing the viral subgroups present in clinical cases with those detected in persistently infected (PI) animals sampled for epidemiological criteria, irrespective of their health condition. Furthermore, the clinical and postmortem findings were compared with respect to genetic characteristics of the viruses isolated from these animals. Our results indicate that the BVDV positive animals fall roughly into two categories, depending on the primary organ affected and the age, with lung-centred pathology occurring mainly in young animals and mucosal pathology predominantly in older animals. Furthermore, we found a markedly higher proportion of representatives of the BVDV-1e subgroup in stillborn calves and aborted foetuses originating from epidemically unrelated cattle herds, suggesting that BVDV-1e may play a special role in prenatal and perinatal losses.","publish_time":"2010-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bachofen, Claudia; Braun, Ueli; Hilbe, Monika; Ehrensperger, Felix; Stalder, Hanspeter; Peterhans, Ernst","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/450921cad3744aa651260fdd482038f546992999.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117366.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509004398; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.09.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19819088/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509004398","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BVDV positive animals","different subgroups of BVDV","BVD viruses","young animals","older animals","host animals","pathology of BVD viral infections","viral subgroups present","potential virulence properties of BVDV","numerous subgroups","clinical cases","genotype viruses","cattle population","important cattle disease","mucosal pathology","wide spectrum of clinical signs","reminiscent of viral haemorrhagic fevers","Abstract Bovine viral diarrhoea","unrelated cattle herds","lung-centred pathology","e subgroup","persistent infection","mild disease","genetic characteristics","genetic species","aborted foetuses","severe forms","stillborn calves","world-wide distribution","special role","age","respect","epidemiological criteria","perinatal losses","pestivirus","categories","postmortem findings","higher proportion of representatives","primary organ","interaction","results","flaviviridae family","health condition","addition","complexity","work"],"language":"en"},

Virological surveillance was undertaken in reference laboratories of the seven French Defence Zones. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report results of virological analyses performed in the Public Hospitals of Marseille during the first months of the outbreak. (i) Nasal swabs were tested using rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) and two RT-PCR assays. Epidemiological characteristics of the 99 first suspected cases were analyzed, including detection of influenza virus and 18 other respiratory viruses. During three months, a total of 1,815 patients were tested (including 236 patients infected H1N1sw virus) and distribution in age groups and results of RIDT were analyzed. (ii) 600 sera received before April 2009 and randomly selected from in-patients were tested by a standard hemagglutination inhibition assay for antibody to the novel H1N1sw virus. (iii) One early (May 2009) and one late (July 2009) viral isolates were characterized by sequencing the complete hemagglutinine and neuraminidase genes. (iiii) Epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of cases that occurred in July 2009 in a summer camp were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study presents new virological and epidemiological data regarding infection by the pandemic A/H1N1 virus in Europe. Distribution in age groups was found to be similar to that previously reported for seasonal H1N1. The first seroprevalence data made available for a European population suggest a previous exposure of individuals over 40 years old to influenza viruses antigenically related to the pandemic (H1N1)-2009 virus. Genomic analysis indicates that strains harbouring a new amino-acid pattern in the neuraminidase gene appeared secondarily and tended to supplant the first strains. Finally, in contrast with previous reports, our data support the use of RIDT for the detection of infection in children, especially in the context of the investigation of grouped cases.","publish_time":"2010-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nougair\u00E8de, Antoine; Ninove, Laetitia; Zandotti, Christine; Salez, Nicolas; Mantey, Karine; Resseguier, No\u00E9mie; Gazin, C\u00E9line; Raoult, Didier; Charrel, R\u00E9mi N.; de Lamballerie, Xavier","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cf0ff471514dc73eaa490d65d0d4a35f1345f6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2822845.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20174643/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009214","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Defence Zones","RIDT"],"locations":["France","Europe"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 virus","detection of influenza virus","cases of pandemic","novel H1N1sw virus","epidemiological data","influenza viruses","patients infected H1N1sw virus","results of RIDT","Epidemiological characteristics","cluster of cases","suspected cases","seasonal H1N1","seroprevalence data","distribution","results of virological analyses","Virological surveillance","use of RIDT","age groups","detection of infection","investigation of grouped cases","months","strains","rapid influenza diagnostic test","previous reports","neuraminidase genes","respiratory viruses","previous exposure of individuals","new amino-acid pattern","antibody","European population","study","reference laboratories","years old","standard hemagglutination inhibition assay","Public Hospitals of Marseille","context","SIGNIFICANCE","French Defence Zones","complete hemagglutinine","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Nasal swabs","RT-PCR assays","children","contrast","iiii","viral isolates","Genomic analysis","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","total","France","summer camp","outbreak","BACKGROUND","sera"],"language":"en"},

Despite the established usefulness of discourse organizational cues for lecture comprehension and note-taking, very little is known about the marking of relevance in this genre. The current overview of lexicogrammatical relevance markers combines a qualitative and quantitative investigation of 160 lectures from the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus. These markers could mostly be classified according to their main element into adjective, noun, verb and adverb patterns. Verb patterns were the most common, followed by noun patterns. The verb pattern V clause (e.g., remember slavery had already been legally abolished) and the noun pattern MN v-link (e.g., the point is) are the predominant types of relevance markers. The discrepancy between the prevalent markers and what may be thought of as prototypical or included in EAP textbooks as relevance markers also demonstrates the need for corpus linguistic research. Implications for EAP course design, teaching English for lecturing purposes, and educational research are discussed.","publish_time":"2012-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deroey, Katrien L.B.; Taverniers, Miriam","journal":"English for Specific Purposes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81f2c369448b2620b20328fe5713d749ea5b75db.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088949061200021X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088949061200021X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["noun patterns","prevalent markers","current overview of lexicogrammatical relevance markers","predominant types of relevance markers","marking of relevance","lectures","verb pattern V clause","adverb patterns","noun pattern MN v-link","corpus linguistic research","teaching English","comprehensive overview of lexicogrammatical devices","EAP textbooks","educational research","EAP course design","British Academic Spoken English","lecturing purposes","established usefulness of discourse organizational cues","BASE","adjective","quantitative investigation","need","lecture comprehension","relevant points","Implications","main element","slavery","paper","genre","discrepancy"],"language":"en"},

Thousands of health workers have been infected and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals, aged care facilities and prisons. World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for contact and droplet precautions for Healthcare Workers (HCWs) caring for suspected COVID-19 patients, whilst the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended airborne precautions. The 1 \u2013 2 m (\u22483 \u2013 6 ft) rule of spatial separation is central to droplet precautions and assumes large droplets do not travel further than 2 m (\u22486 ft). We aimed to review the evidence for horizontal distance travelled by droplets and the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), US Center for Diseases Control (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on respiratory protection for COVID-19. We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1 \u2013 2 m (\u22483 \u2013 6 ft) rule of spatial separation. Of ten studies on horizontal droplet distance, eight showed droplets travel more than 2 m (\u22486 ft), in some cases more than 8 meters (\u224826 ft). Several studies of SARS-CoV-2 support aerosol transmission and one study documented virus at a distance of 4 meters (\u224813 ft) from the patient.

Available studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, 3 hours after aeroslisation.

Relatively small genomes and high replication rates allow viruses to accumulate mutations and continuously present the host with new challenges. It is therefore, no surprise that they either escape detection or modulate host physiology, often by redirecting normal cellular pathways to their own advantage. Viruses utilize a diverse array of strategies and molecular targets to subvert host cellular processes, while evading detection. These include cell-cycle regulation, major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen presentation, intracellular protein transport, apoptosis, cytokine-mediated signaling, and humoral immune responses. Moreover, viruses routinely manipulate the host cell cycle to create a favorable environment for replication, largely by deregulating cell cycle checkpoints. This review focuses on our current understanding of the molecular aspects of cell cycle regulation that are often targeted by viruses. Further study of their interactions should provide fundamental insights into cell cycle regulation and improve our ability to exploit these viruses.","publish_time":"2018-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Ying; Sanyal, Sumana; Bruzzone, Roberto","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a0f4aac2dfa46df489b653a06df4b5036e452ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6252338.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2018.00396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510918/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viruses","host cell cycle","cell-cycle regulation","molecular aspects of cell cycle regulation","deregulating cell cycle checkpoints","host cellular processes","host physiology","detection","Interactions","shaped cellular function","normal cellular pathways","molecular targets","immune system","high replication rates","humoral immune responses","major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen presentation","intracellular protein transport","fundamental insights","diverse array of strategies","cytokine","apoptosis","co-evolution","favorable environment","current understanding","small genomes","course","mutations","ability","counter measures","advantage","review","study","new challenges","surprise"],"language":"en"},

Over the past decade, signal enhancement strategies that took advantage of the laser excitation of plasmonic nanomaterials have pushed down the detection limit and enabled quantification of analytes. Significantly, these methods amplify the signal based on the current LFA design without modification. This review highlights these strategies of signal enhancement for LFA including surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), photothermal and photoacoustic methods.

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of these infections on general health and reproduction parameters measurable on herd level and to explore the association between antibody status and some herd characteristics. METHODS: We collected a pooled milk sample from five primiparous cows from 79 Swedish dairy herds in September 2006. The samples were analysed for immunoglobulin G antibodies to BCV and BRSV with indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Herd level data from 1 September 2005 to 30 August 2006 were accessed retrospectively. The location of the herds was mapped using a geographical information system. RESULTS: Ten herds were antibody negative to both viruses and were compared with 69 herds positive to BCV or BRSV or both. Positive herds had a higher (P = 0.001) bulk tank milk somatic cell count (BMSCC) compared with negative herds. The medians for all other analyzed health and reproductive parameters were consistently in favour of the herds negative to both viruses although the differences were not statistically significant. A higher proportion (P = 0.01) of herds used professional technicians for artificial insemination, rather than farm personnel, amongst the 33 herds negative to BCV compared with the 46 positive herds. CONCLUSIONS: Our result shows that herds that were antibody positive to BCV and/or BRSV had a higher BMSCC compared with herds negative to BCV and BRSV. There was also tendency that negative herds had a better general herd health compared with positive. A higher proportion amongst the BCV negative herds used external technicians for AI instead of farm personnel, indicating that it is possible to avoid infection although having regular visits. Negative herds were located in close proximity to positive herds, indicating that local spread and airborne transmission between herds might not be of great importance and that herds can stay free from these infection transmission although virus is circulating in the area.","publish_time":"2010-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ohlson, Anna; Emanuelson, Ulf; Tr\u00E5v\u00E9n, Madeleine; Alenius, Stefan","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d78b0600b84cfd57e11ba249ee58c159fe517ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2891787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20525326/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-52-37","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCV","BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["herds positive","Positive herds","BCV negative herds","Swedish dairy herds","antibody negative","BRSV","antibody positive","higher BMSCC","higher proportion","general health","better general herd health","herd characteristics","Herd level data","bovine corona virus","analyzed health","antibody status","farm personnel","infection transmission","viruses","Bovine respiratory syncytial virus","external technicians","reproductive parameters","professional technicians","airborne transmission","reproduction parameters measurable","pooled milk sample","bulk tank milk somatic cell count","primiparous cows","artificial insemination","local spread","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","immunoglobulin G antibodies","infections","association","close proximity","result shows","effects","BACKGROUND","great importance","samples","CONCLUSIONS","favour","cattle","tendency","RESULTS","geographical information system","regular visits","differences","METHODS","medians","objective","area","location"],"language":"en"},

For over 60 years, various extensions and applications to the popular newsvendor model have been suggested, where cost/profit are often the focal objective. We propose a new version of the traditional single-period newsvendor model - the \u201DRippled Newsvendor\u201D - with supply chain severity (i.e. risk propagation) as the primary objective while taking into account network structure. Our model considers exogenous and endogenous risk(s) of disruption while exploring the tension between under-supply and \u201Dwear-and-tear\u201D (i.e system breakdown). To model the intricacies of this trade-off whilst minimizing the potential spread of risk, we leverage a Bayesian Network whereby the conditional probability distributions are functions of the inventory ordering decisions. We use a simulation study to understand the nature of our objective function as well as to gain insight into the potential optimal ordering policies of this new model. Furthermore, the simulation seeks to understand how the various factors in our system impact total risk severity, and if they do so in different ways. Our simulations indicate that local exogenous risk is of greater importance than non-local exogenous risk. Furthermore, we show that the type of risk, as well as the structural characteristics of the supply chain and inventory system, impact risk severity differently.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garvey, Myles D.; Carnovale, Steven","journal":"Int J Prod Econ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4c943d52a3edd62d2d9de19f997eb4b7ac9373d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/985508ad4eb398d06bb44c21ce51089a147e2b71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7155164.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292241/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107752; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527320301377; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925527320301377","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endogenous risk","type of risk","impact risk severity","potential spread of risk","non-local exogenous risk","new model","system impact total risk severity","supply chain severity","inventory system","popular newsvendor model","propagation of supply chain disruptions","under-supply","inventory policies","traditional single-period newsvendor model","Rippled Newsvendor","inventory ordering decisions","primary objective","focal objective","objective function","potential optimal ordering policies","account network structure","e system breakdown","various extensions","Bayesian Network","various factors","new version","simulation study","greater importance","conditional probability distributions","functions","risks","applications","insight","wear","nature","structural characteristics","ripple effect","trade-off","years","profit","tear","cost","simulations","managers","different ways","intricacies"],"language":"en"},

The TGEV primers and probe were designed to be specific to a portion of the S gene sequence conserved in all TGEV isolates, but absent in the closely related porcine respiratory coronaviruses. The optimized TaqMan assay detected a minimum of 2.8 copies of in vitro transcribed RNA of the target S gene and RNA extracted from 1 TCID50/ml of TGEV. Using 113 clinical samples received at our diagnostic laboratory over a 4-year period, the performance of the assay was tested and compared with that of a previously described nested RT-PCR assay. All the fecal samples which tested positive for TGEV by the nested RT-PCR assay also tested positive by the TaqMan assay. However, approximately 9% of the samples that tested negative by the nested RT-PCR assay tested positive by the TaqMan assay. These results indicate that the developed TaqMan assay is a highly sensitive diagnostic test for rapid detection of TGEV in pig fecal samples.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vemulapalli, Ramesh; Gulani, Jatinder; Santrich, Cecilia","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1816969c8c8e578e34b3779cf0e04aabbda5ccb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112873.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19729039/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409003930; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409003930; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.08.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed TaqMan assay","nested RT-PCR assay","optimized TaqMan assay","real-time RT-PCR assay","TGEV isolates","TGEV primers","TaqMan probe","pig fecal samples","rapid detection of TGEV","clinical samples","transcribed RNA","simultaneous detection of RNA","S gene sequence","target S gene","RNA of enhanced green fluorescent protein","diagnostic laboratory","sensitive diagnostic test","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","EGFP","minimum","year period","portion","copies of","performance","TCID50","results","porcine respiratory coronaviruses","internal amplification control"],"language":"en"},

More attention should be paid to comorbidities in the treatment of COVID-19. In the literature, COVID-19 is characterised by the symptoms of viral pneumonia such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, and lymphopenia. Many of the older patients who become severely ill have evidence of underlying illness such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, kidney disease, or malignant tumours.3, 4, 5 These patients often die of their original comorbidities; we therefore need to accurately evaluate all original comorbidities of individuals with COVID-19. In addition to the risk of group transmission of an infectious disease, we should pay full attention to the treatment of the original comorbidities of the individual while treating pneumonia, especially in older patients with serious comorbid conditions. Not only capable of causing pneumonia, COVID-19 may also cause damage to other organs such as the heart, the liver, and the kidneys, as well as to organ systems such as the blood and the immune system.3, 4, 5 Patients eventually die of multiple organ failure, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, arrhythmias, and renal failure.5, 6 We should therefore pay attention to potential multi-organ injuries and the protection and prevention thereof in the treatment of COVID-19. \u2022 View related content for this article We took over a ward for the centralised treatment of severely ill patients in Wuhan Tongji Hospital. 60 patients were classified into three types during their treatment. 13 [22%] of 60 patients mainly had pneumonia and were classified as type A. Basic treatments were provided, such as antivirals, antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and glucocorticoids. 33 (55%) of 60 patients were type B, with disease that manifested with different degrees of pneumonia, accompanied by serious comorbidities. For patients classified as type B, we continued to monitor the changes of comorbidities while managing the pneumonia, carrying out individual evaluations and developing specific treatment plans, including antihypertensives, hypoglycaemic therapy, and continuous renal replacement therapy. 14 (23%) of 60 patients were critically ill and were classified as type C. Patients classified as type C had disease that was considered to have developed from the aggravation of disease seen either in type A or type B, when early therapeutic effects for type A disease were unsatisfactory (resulting in multiple organ injuries), or when disease associated with type B became aggravated and the patient\u0027s condition deteriorated from their original comorbidities (leading to multiple organ failure). Attention should be paid to organ function in these critically ill patients and necessary protective measures, including mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoids, antivirals, symptomatic treatments, and anti-shock therapy. We believe that the classification of COVID-19 in severe patients could help in individual evaluation of the disease and would provide effective triage for the treatment and management of individual patients.

This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients. METHODS: One hundred sixteen COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Twelve (10.8%) patients showed mild increase of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine (\u003C26 \u03BCmol/L within 48 h), and 8 (7.2%) patients showed trace or 1\u002B albuminuria in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). All these patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria of AKI. In addition, 5 patients with CKD who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before admission were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed as COVID-19. In addition to therapy for COVID-19, CRRT was also applied 3 times weekly during hospitalization for these 5 patients with CKD. In the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable state in all 5 patients with CKD, without exacerbation of CKD, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CKD were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without CKD, and 1 patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab from 5 cases with CKD. CONCLUSION: AKI was uncommon in COVID-19.

Aim To evaluate the in-vitro efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV), a vapour-phase disinfection method, for the inactivation of a number of structurally distinct viruses of importance in the healthcare, veterinary and public sectors. The viruses studied were: feline calicivirus (FCV, a norovirus surrogate); human adenovirus type 1; transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus of pigs (TGEV, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] surrogate); avian influenza virus (AIV); and swine influenza virus (SwIV). Methods The viruses were dried on stainless steel discs in 20- or 40-\u03BCL aliquots and exposed to HPV produced by a Clarus L generator (Bioquell, Horsham, PA, USA) in a 0.2-m3 environmental chamber. Three vaporized volumes of hydrogen peroxide were tested in triplicate for each virus: 25, 27 and 33mL. Findings No viable viruses were identified after HPV exposure at any of the vaporized volumes tested. HPV was virucidal (\u003E4-log reduction) against FCV, adenovirus, TGEV and AIV at the lowest vaporized volume tested (25mL). For SwIV, due to low virus titre on the control discs, \u003E3.8-log reduction was shown for the 25-mL vaporized volume and \u003E4-log reduction was shown for the 27-mL and 33-mL vaporized volumes.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that infects the liver as primary target. Currently, a high affinity receptor for HBV is still unknown. The dendritic cell specific C\u2010type lectin DC\u2010SIGN is involved in pathogen recognition through mannose and fucose containing carbohydrates leading to the induction of an anti\u2010viral immune response. Many glycosylated viruses subvert this immune surveillance function and exploit DC\u2010SIGN as a port of entry and for trans\u2010infection of target cells. The glycosylation pattern on HBV surface antigens (HBsAg) together with the tissue distribution of HBV would allow interaction between HBV and DC\u2010SIGN and its liver\u2010expressed homologue L\u2010SIGN. Therefore, a detailed study to investigate the binding of HBV to DC\u2010SIGN and L\u2010SIGN was performed. For HCV, both DC\u2010SIGN and L\u2010SIGN are known to bind envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. Soluble DC\u2010SIGN and L\u2010SIGN specifically bound HCV virus\u2010like particles, but no interaction with either HBsAg or HepG2.2.15\u2010derived HBV was detected. Also, neither DC\u2010SIGN nor L\u2010SIGN transfected Raji cells bound HBsAg. In contrast, highly mannosylated HBV, obtained by treating HBV producing HepG2.2.15 cells with the \u03B1\u2010mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine, is recognized by DC\u2010SIGN. The \u03B1\u2010mannosidase I trimming of N\u2010linked oligosaccharide structures thus prevents recognition by DC\u2010SIGN. On the basis of these findings, it is tempting to speculate that HBV exploits mannose trimming as a way to escape recognition by DC\u2010SIGN and thereby subvert a possible immune activation response.","publish_time":"2008-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Op den Brouw, M.

As FcRs can trigger positive and negative signals, as these signals control several biological activities in individual cells, as FcRs are expressed by many cells of hematopoietic origin, mostly of the myeloid lineage, as these cells express various combinations of FcRs, and as FcR-expressing cells have different functional repertoires, antibodies can exert a wide spectrum of biological activities. Like B and T Cell Receptors (BCRs and TCRs), FcRs are bona fide immunoreceptors. Unlike BCRs and TCRs, however, FcRs are immunoreceptors with an adaptive specificity for antigen, with an adaptive affinity for antibodies, with an adaptive structure and with an adaptive signaling. They induce adaptive biological responses that depend on their tissue distribution and on FcR-expressing cells that are selected locally by antibodies. They critically determine health and disease. They are thus exquisitely adaptive therapeutic tools.","publish_time":"2014-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Da\u00EBron, Marc","journal":"Fc Receptors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3da462455f5bc2edd234206ccd5bdc9d16c50842.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120570.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25116099/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07911-0_7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biological activities of antibodies","adaptive biological responses","adaptive specificity","adaptive affinity","adaptive structure","individual cells","various combinations of FcRs","adaptive therapeutic tools","cells of hematopoietic origin","wide spectrum of biological activities","TCRs","BCRs","immunoreceptors","T Cell Receptors","negative signals","variety of cell types","different functional repertoires","antigen","Fc portion of immunoglobulins","myeloid lineage","tissue distribution","ability","health","disease"],"language":"en"},

The poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) polymers formed alter the physico-chemical characteristics of the substrate with functional consequences on its biological activities. Recently, non-covalent binding to pADPr has emerged as a key mechanism to modulate and coordinate several intracellular pathways including the DNA damage response, protein stability and cell death. In this review, we describe the basis of non-covalent binding to pADPr that has led to the emerging concept of pADPr-responsive signaling pathways. This review emphasizes the structural elements and the modular strategies developed by pADPr-binding proteins to exert a fine-tuned control of a variety of pathways. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions are highly regulated processes, both spatially and temporally, for which at least four specialized pADPr-binding modules accommodate different pADPr structures and reprogram protein functions.

Sequence analysis of the complete genomes revealed differences at 123 and 149 nucleotides (nt) throughout the entire genome between the respiratory and enteric strains for samples AH65 and AH187, respectively, indicating the presence of intra-host BCoV quasispecies. In addition, significant numbers of sequence ambiguities were found in the genomes of some BCoV-R and BCoV-E strains, suggesting intra-isolate quasispecies. The tissue culture (TC) passaged counterparts of AH65 respiratory BCoV (AH65-R-TC) and enteric BCoV (AH65-E-TC) were also sequenced after 14 and 15 passages and 1 plaque purification in human rectal tumor cells (HRT-18), respectively. Compared to the parental wild type strains, tissue culture passage generated 104 nt changes in the AH65-E-TC isolate but only 8 nt changes in the AH65-R-TC isolate. Particularly noteworthy, the majority of nucleotide changes in the AH65-E-TC isolate occurred at the identical positions as the mutations occurring in the AH65-R strain from the same animal.

This study included 104 dairy operations in 13 states that participated in the National Animal Health Monitoring System\u0027s Dairy 2014 calf component study. This 18-mo longitudinal study focused on dairy heifer calves from birth to weaning, and data were collected on 2,545 heifer calves. Descriptive statistics were generated regarding colostrum feeding, preweaning housing, milk feeding and consumption, growth, morbidity and mortality, and weaning practices. The majority of calves enrolled were Holsteins (89.4%). Over half the calves (63.2%) enrolled in the study received the majority of their colostrum via bottle; however, 22.1% of calves from 51.0% of operations received colostrum via suckling from their dams. For all calves, the mean time to the first colostrum feeding was 2.8 h, and the average amount of colostrum at the first feeding was 2.9 L, with 4.5 L provided in the first 24 h. The mean serum IgG of all calves was 21.7 g/L; however, 76.0% of operations had at least 1 calf with failure of passive transfer of immunity with a serum IgG below 10 g/L. The majority of calves in the study were housed individually (86.6%). Nonetheless, 20.2% of operations housed some calves in groups, representing 13.4% of all calves. Approximately one-half of the calves in the study (52.3%) were dehorned or disbudded during the preweaning period, with only 27.8% of these calves receiving analgesics or anesthetics during the procedure. Whole or waste milk was the liquid diet type fed to 40.1% of calves, and milk replacer was fed to 34.8% of calves. A combination of milk and milk replacer was fed to 25.1% of calves. Calves, on average, were fed 2.6 L per feeding and fed 2.6 times/d, resulting in a total of 5.6 L of liquid diet fed per day. The mean average daily gain for all calves enrolled in the study was 0.7 kg/d. Fecal samples were collected and almost all operations had at least 1 calf positive for Cryptosporidium (94.2%) or Giardia (99.0%), and 84.6% of operations had calves that tested positive for both Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Over one-third of calves (38.1%) had at least one morbidity event during the preweaning period and the mortality rate was 5.0%. The mean age at weaning was 65.7 d.

NLR activation leads to inflammasome formation, the activation of caspase-1, and the subsequent cleavage of IL-1\u03B2 and IL-18. Considering that inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03B2 induction by macrophages are key players for an appropriate T cell response, we investigated the relevance of NLR pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and caspase-1/11 to elucidate their roles in the induction of different T cell phenotypes and the relationship with parasite load and hepatic inflammation during T. cruzi-Tulahuen strain acute infection. We demonstrated that infected nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice exhibited similar parasitemia and survival, although the parasite load was higher in the livers of nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice than in those of WT mice. Increased levels of transaminases and pro-inflammatory cytokines were found in the plasma of WT and nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice indicating that NLRP3 is dispensable to control the parasitemia but it is required for a better clearance of parasites in the liver. Importantly, we have found that NLRP3 and caspase-1/11-deficient mice differentially modulate T helper (Th1, Th2, and Th17) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte phenotypes. Strikingly, caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 mice showed the most dramatic reduction in the number of IFN-\u03B3- and IL-17-producing CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells associated with higher parasitemia and lower survival. Additionally, caspase-1/11\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated significantly reduced liver inflammation with the lowest alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels but the highest hepatic parasitic load. These results unequivocally demonstrate that caspase-1/11 pathway plays an important role in the induction of liver adaptive immunity against this parasite infection as well as in hepatic inflammation.","publish_time":"2018-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paroli, Augusto F.; Gonzalez, Patricia V.; D\u00EDaz-Luj\u00E1n, Cintia; Onofrio, Luisina I.; Arocena, Alfredo; Cano, Roxana C.; Carrera-Silva, Eugenio A.; Gea, Susana","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88c6e8b041b0eceb7b8282f3dbb066848fd554b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5944318.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29774028/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00913","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WT mice","activation of caspase","deficient mice","parasite infection","parasite load","livers of nlrp3","infected nlrp3","T cells","T helper","hepatic inflammation","inflammasome activation","NLR activation","induction of different T cell phenotypes","\u03B2 induction","activation of nucleotide","higher parasitemia","reduced liver inflammation","appropriate T cell response","cytotoxic T lymphocyte phenotypes","protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi results","induction of liver adaptive immunity","highest hepatic parasitic load","acute infection","similar parasitemia","plasma of WT","subsequent cleavage of IL","cruzi-Tulahuen","binding domain","relevance of NLR pyrin domain","inflammasome formation","lower survival","Increased levels of transaminases","relationship","key players","lowest alanine aminotransferase","leucine-rich repeat","ALT","Th17","macrophages","pro-inflammatory cytokines","Th2","C57BL","important role","number of IFN","wild type","receptors","dramatic reduction","CD8","CD4","roles","NLRs","better clearance of parasites","pathway"],"language":"en"},

Efficient recoding usually requires an RNA pseudoknot located several nucleotides downstream from the recoding site. To assess the strategic importance of the recoding pseudoknots, we have carried out a large scale genome-wide analysis in which we used an in-house developed program to detect all possible H-type pseudoknots within the genomic mRNAs of 81 animal viruses. Pseudoknots are detected downstream from ~85% of the recoding sites, including many previously unknown pseudoknots. ~78% of the recoding pseudoknots are the most stable pseudoknot within the viral genomes. However, they are not as strong as some designed pseudoknots that exhibit roadblocking effect on the translating ribosome. Strong roadblocking pseudoknots are not detected within the viral genomes. These results indicate that the decoding pseudoknots have evolved to possess optimal stability for efficient recoding. We also found that the sequence at the gag-pol frameshift junction of HIV1 harbors potential elaborated pseudoknots encompassing the frameshift site. A novel mechanism is proposed for possible involvement of the elaborated pseudoknots in the HIV1 PRF event.","publish_time":"2013-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Xiaolan; Cheng, Qiang; Du, Zhihua","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01b5ae0cce289ca9cdcebc4079f960e833cfbd79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3835772.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24298557/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/984028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recoding pseudoknots","designed pseudoknots","decoding pseudoknots","unknown pseudoknots","Strong roadblocking pseudoknots","Efficient recoding","potential elaborated pseudoknots","recoding sites","possible H-type pseudoknots","translational recoding mechanisms","RNA pseudoknot","RNA viruses","frameshift site","viral genomes","HIV1 PRF event","possible involvement","stable pseudoknot","roadblocking effect","animal viruses","gag-pol frameshift junction of HIV1","codon readthrough","genomic mRNAs","enzymatic proteins","optimal stability","large scale genome-wide analysis","in-house developed program","nucleotides","defined ratio","translating ribosome","novel mechanism","sequence","strategic importance","ribosomal frameshifting","results"],"language":"en"},

This review provides a background on the various sources and pathways through which pathogenic bacteria contaminate fresh produce; the survival and proliferation of pathogens on fresh produce while growing and potential methods to reduce microbial contamination before harvest. Some of the established bacterial contamination sources include contaminated manure, irrigation water, soil, livestock/ wildlife, and numerous factors influence the incidence, fate, transport, survival and proliferation of pathogens in the wide variety of sources where they are found. Once pathogenic bacteria have been introduced into the growing environment, they can colonize and persist on fresh produce using a variety of mechanisms.

Infancy is also a critical time for post-natal lung growth and development. Severe or repeated lower airway injury in very young children likely increases the likelihood of chronic pulmonary disorders later in life. Globally, bronchiolitis is the most common form of acute lower respiratory infections during infancy. Compared with non-Indigenous Australian infants, Indigenous infants have greater bacterial density in their upper airways and more severe bronchiolitis episodes. Our study tests the hypothesis that the anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin, improve the clinical outcomes of Indigenous Australian infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis. METHODS: We are conducting a dual centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial in northern Australia. Indigenous infants (aged \u2264 24-months, expected number = 200) admitted to one of two regional hospitals (Darwin, Northern Territory and Townsville, Queensland) with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis and fulfilling inclusion criteria are randomised (allocation concealed) to either azithromycin (30 mg/kg/dose) or placebo administered once weekly for three doses. Clinical data are recorded twice daily and nasopharyngeal swab are collected at enrolment and at the time of discharge from hospital. Primary outcomes are \u0027length of oxygen requirement\u0027 and \u0027duration of stay,\u0027 the latter based upon being judged as \u0027ready for respiratory discharge\u0027. The main secondary outcome is readmission for a respiratory illness within 6-months of leaving hospital. Descriptive virological and bacteriological (including development of antibiotic resistance) data from nasopharyngeal samples will also be reported. DISCUSSION: Two published studies, both involving different patient populations and settings, as well as different macrolide antibiotics and treatment duration, have produced conflicting results. Our randomised, placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin in Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis is designed to determine whether it can reduce short-term (and potentially long-term) morbidity from respiratory illness in Australian Indigenous infants who are at high risk of developing chronic respiratory illness. If azithromycin is efficacious in reducing the morbidly of Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis, the intervention would lead to improved short term (and possibly long term) health benefits.

In cell lines, fAPN serves as a receptor for serotype II, but not for serotype I FIPV. The role of fAPN in infection of in vivo target cells, monocytes, is not yet confirmed. Both serotype I and II FIPVs use fDC-SIGN for infection of monocyte-derived cells but how is not known. In this study, the role of fAPN and fDC-SIGN was studied at different stages in FIPV infection of monocytes. First, the effects of blocking the potential receptor(s) were studied for the processes of attachment and infection. Secondly, the level of co-localization of FIPV and the receptors was determined. It was found that FIPV I binding and infection were not affected by blocking fAPN while blocking fDC-SIGN reduced FIPV I binding to 36% and practically completely inhibited infection. Accordingly, 66% of bound FIPV I particles co-localized with fDC-SIGN. Blocking fAPN reduced FIPV II binding by 53% and infection by 80%. Further, 60% of bound FIPV II co-localized with fAPN. fDC-SIGN was not involved in FIPV II binding but infection was reduced with 64% when fDC-SIGN was blocked. In conclusion, FIPV I infection of monocytes depends on fDC-SIGN. Most FIPV I particles already interact with fDC-SIGN at the plasma membrane. For FIPV II, both fAPN and fDC-SIGN are involved in infection with only fAPN playing a receptor role at the plasma membrane.","publish_time":"2011-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Hamme, Evelien; Desmarets, Lowiese; Dewerchin, Hannah L.; Nauwynck, Hans J.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/520a5aabfd10f62a6be61f73a811388ce4e3bf7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114467.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211001687; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211001687; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.04.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21600938/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","FIPV II"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fDC-SIGN reduced FIPV","FIPV infection of monocytes","bound FIPV","role of fAPN","FIPVs use fDC-SIGN","inhibited infection","level of co-localization of FIPV","binding","receptor role","serotype","particles co-localized","plasma membrane","potential receptors","feline aminopeptidase N","feline infectious peritonitis virus","feline dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule","cell lines","derived cells","target cells","non-integrin","different stages","conclusion","processes of attachment","effects","study"],"language":"en"},

Flotillin expression is increased under pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Despite their importance for signal transduction, very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of flotillins. Here, we analyzed the expression of flotillins at transcriptional level and identified flotillins as downstream targets of the mitogen activated kinases ERK1/2. The promoter activity of flotillins was increased upon growth factor stimulation in a MAPK dependent manner. Overexpression of serum response factor or early growth response gene 1 resulted in increased flotillin mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, both promoter activity and expression of endogenous flotillins were increased upon treatment with retinoic acid or by overexpression of the retinoid X receptor and its binding partners RAR\u03B1 and PPAR\u03B3. Our data indicate that the expression of flotillins, which can be detected in all cultured cells, is fine-tuned in response to various external stimuli.

Although viremia occurs, histologic lesions are not found uniformly throughout lymphoid tissues. We used experimental infection of cats with a highly pathogenic FIPV isolate, UCD8, to study histologic lesions, virus replication, and cytokine expression in multiple lymphoid tissues during the effusive phase of disease. Viral RNA was found in 76% of central tissues (mediastinal lymph node, spleen, mesenteric lymph node) examined, as compared to 27% of peripheral tissues (popliteal lymph node, cervical lymph node, femoral bone marrow). All tissues positive for virus replication also demonstrated lymphoid depletion. Generally, affected tissues had lower levels of IL-4 and IL-12\u2013p40 mRNA and higher levels of IL-10 mRNA. Although no differences in IFN-\u03B3 or TNF-\u03B1 mRNA were measured, TNF-\u03B1 protein expression was greater in affected tissues and demonstrated a shift in the source of TNF-\u03B1 from macrophages to lymphocytes. Together, these results colocalize FIPV replication, lymphocyte depletion in tissues, and alterations in cytokine transcription and translation.

Viral entry, and de novo protein expression and/or DNA replication were potentially responsible for the activation of PLC\u03B3-1 signaling. PLC signaling inhibitors of both U73122 and edelfosine significantly inhibited BoHV-1 replication in both bovine kidney cells (MDBK) and rabbit skin cells (RS-1) in a dose-dependent manner by affecting the virus entry stage(s). In addition, the activation of Erk1/2 and p38MAPK signaling, and the enhanced generation of ROS by BoHV-1 infection were obviously ameliorated by chemical inhibition of PLC signaling, implying the requirement of PLC signaling in ROS production and these MAPK pathway activation. These results suggest that the activation of PLC signaling is a potential pathogenic mechanism for BoHV-1 infection.","publish_time":"2017-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Liqian; Yuan, Chen; Ding, Xiuyan; Jones, Clinton; Zhu, Guoqiang","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9f06d5d74da4a652380fba693796d46d64c2dbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5590182.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-017-0450-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882164/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDBK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection of MDBK cells","activation of PLC\u03B3","inhibited BoHV","requirement of PLC","activation of Erk1","h post-infection","MAPK pathway activation","enhanced generation of ROS","chemical inhibition of PLC","ROS production","hpi","bovine kidney cells","virus entry stage","rabbit skin cells","virus induced inflammation","DNA replication","Viral entry","early stages","late stages","stimulated MAPK","Bovine herpesvirus","generation of inflammatory mediator reactive oxidative species","novo protein expression","edelfosine","U73122","potential pathogenic mechanism","dose-dependent manner","p38MAPK","phospholipase C","inhibitors","time","addition","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Seventy\u2010nine children with wheezing requiring hospitalization at age \u003C2 years were prospectively followed up and re\u2010investigated at age 5.6\u20138.8 years when the measurements of baseline lung function and bronchial responsiveness to exercise were performed. Results: At early school age, 23% of children had decreased lung function, and 13% had increased bronchial responsiveness to exercise. Predictors of decreased lung function were maternal history of smoking during pregnancy (odds ratio [OR], 12.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2\u2013139.6), parental history of asthma (OR, 4.3; 95%CI: 1.1\u201317.1), and female gender (OR, 4.0; 95%CI: 1.2\u201313.7).

Here, we further analyzed characteristics of these newly identified HIV-1 restriction factors. Firstly, in contrast to other anti-HIV-1 proteins, such as tetherin and APOBEC3G, IFITMs were resistant to a down-regulation of surface expression or degradation by HIV-1 proteins. Secondly, the enforced expression of IFITMs reduced the production of HIV-1 viruses from cells transfected with proviral plasmids containing whole viral sequences. Although their inhibitory activities were modest when compared to that of tetherin, IFITMs, but not tetherin, directly reduced the expression of HIV-1 proteins including Gag, Vif and Nef. Of importance, however, IFITMs had no inhibitory effect when these viral proteins were expressed by codon-optimized cDNAs that bypassed the viral-specific expression machinery. Indeed, our results supported the idea that IFITMs interfere with viral protein expression mediated by double-stranded viral RNAs, such as RRE and TAR. Finally, the S-palmitoylation of IFITMs, which is crucial for their anti-influenza virus activity, was not required for their anti-HIV-1 activity, indicating that IFITMs restrict these viruses at different steps. These characteristics lead to a better understanding of the mechanism by which IFITMs restrict HIV-1 and other viruses.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chutiwitoonchai, Nopporn; Hiyoshi, Masateru; Hiyoshi-Yoshidomi, Yuka; Hashimoto, Michihiro; Tokunaga, Kenzo; Suzu, Shinya","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3364596826c6341e4d0d914c3a175ef9c23dbf6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110712.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457913000191; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457913000191; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2012.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23376165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RRE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of HIV","anti-HIV","viral proteins","enforced expression of IFITMs","production of HIV","identified HIV","viral protein expression","viral RNAs","viral sequences","viral-specific expression machinery","tetherin","regulation of surface expression","replication of various viruses","characteristics","Abstract IFN-inducible IFITM proteins","anti-influenza virus activity","inhibitory effect","inhibitory activities","proviral plasmids","double","degradation","IFITM1","codon-optimized cDNAs","cells","Gag","idea","APOBEC3G","better understanding","RRE","Vif","Nef","restriction factors","different steps","S-palmitoylation","TAR","understood mechanisms","results","contrast","importance"],"language":"en"},

A molecular characterization of nine monoclonal antibodies raised in immune mice, using highly purified, inactivated SARS-CoV as the inoculating antigen, is presented in this report. These antibodies are specific for numerous viral protein targets, and six of them are able to effectively neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro, including one with a neutralizing titre of 0.075nM. A phylogenetic analysis of the heavy and light chain sequences reveals that the mAbs share considerable homology. The majority of the heavy chains belong to a single Ig germline V-gene family, while considerably more sequence variation is evident in the light chain sequences. These analyses demonstrate that neutralization ability can be correlated with specific murine VH-gene alleles. For instance, one evident trend is high sequence conservation in the VH chains of the neutralizing mAbs, particularly in CDR-1 and CDR-2. The results suggest that optimization of murine mAbs for neutralization of SARS-CoV infection will likely be possible, and will aid in the development of diagnostic tools and passive treatments for SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2005-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gubbins, Michael J.; Plummer, Frank A.; Yuan, Xin Y.; Johnstone, Darrell; Drebot, Mike; Andonova, Maya; Andonov, Anton; Berry, Jody D.","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69403975272536434ad77f177871ffa4c828873e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112650.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589004002548; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589004002548","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","neutralization of SARS","inactivated SARS-CoV","SARS-coronavirus","neutralizing mAbs","optimization of murine mAbs","VH chains","heavy chains","specific murine VH-gene alleles","development of diagnostic tools","light chain sequences","availability of monoclonal antibodies","treatment of infection","CDR","sequence variation","evident trend","neutralization ability","neutralizing titre","high sequence conservation","single Ig germline V-gene family","passive treatments","numerous viral protein targets","immune mice","inoculating antigen","phylogenetic analysis","instance","molecular characterization","results","considerable homology","nM","analyses","majority","report"],"language":"en"},

The number one pathogen causing CAP is pneumococcus, which is commonly resistant to multiple antibiotics, thus complicating management. Other common pathogens include atypical organisms (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), Hemophilus influenzae, enteric Gram-negatives (especially in those with chronic illness and aspiration risk factors), and Staphylococcus aureus. Successful management requires careful assessment of disease severity so that a site-of-care decision can be made (outpatient, inpatient, intensive care unit), appropriate samples for diagnostic testing collected, and antibiotic therapy initiated in a timely and accurate fashion. Initial antibiotic therapy is empiric, but even with extensive diagnostic testing, less than half of all patients have an etiologic pathogen identified. All patients with CAP require therapy for pneumococcus, atypical pathogens, and other organisms, as dictated by the presence of specific risk factors. Because pneumonia has both short-term and long-term impact on mortality, it is also important to focus on prevention of this illness, which requires smoking cessation, and giving at-risk individuals both pneumococal and influenza vaccines.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niederman, M.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the P4P system in terms of default rate. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. National Health Insurance Research Datasets in Taiwan from 2002 to 2005 has been used for the study. The study compared the differences of TB default rate before and after the implementation of P4P program, between participating and non-participating hospitals, and between P4P hospitals with and without case managers. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the related factors influencing TB patients default treatment after TB detected. RESULTS: The treatment default rate after \u201CP4P on TB\u201D was 11.37% compared with the 15.56% before \u201CP4P on TB\u201D implementation. The treatment default rate in P4P hospitals was 10.67% compared to 12.7% in non-P4P hospitals.

Study design A retrospective case-control study was performed including newborns with NEC and newborns without NEC, examining demographic factors and exposures to medications, staff members, and procedures before illness. Stool samples from affected newborns were collected and tested for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Results We confirmed a NEC outbreak in the NICU in January 1998 with 8 cases, including 2 deaths, clustered in time and space. Norovirus-like particles were identified in all available stools from cases; norovirus (NoV) was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 4 of 6 samples. NEC cases were younger, had lower Apgar scores, and received antibiotics longer than 25 control subjects. Three NICU health care personnel had more contact with cases than control subjects; 1 staff member recalled having gastroenteritis symptoms around the time of the outbreak. Conclusions This report associates NoV with NEC. NoV appeared to precipitate NEC in predisposed infants. Spatial clustering and epidemiologic links between cases and a health care worker with gastroenteritis suggests that NoV should be investigated among the etiologies of NEC outbreaks and that interventions targeted to interruption of NoV transmission should be considered.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turcios-Ruiz, Reina M.; Axelrod, Peter; St. John, Keith; Bullitt, Esther; Donahue, Joan; Robinson, Nancy; Friss, Helena E.","journal":"The Journal of Pediatrics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/677e721c74f2f5903acfc1373e01f889945e05ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094480.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347608002825; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.04.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18534621/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022347608002825","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NEC","NICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NEC cases","etiologies of NEC outbreaks","control subjects","control measures","NICU health care personnel","health care worker","affected newborns","retrospective case-control study","time","Norovirus","illness risk factors","outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis","staff members","demographic factors","neonatal intensive care unit","gastroenteritis symptoms","Stool samples","contact","medications","exposures","epidemiologic links","lower Apgar scores","interventions","antibiotics","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","procedures","Spatial clustering","available stools","etiology","interruption","particles","bacteria","deaths","parasites","viruses","transmission","space","Objectives","Conclusions","associates","predisposed infants"],"language":"en"},

The transmembrane C-type lectins human dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and its mouse homolog SIGN-R1 are distributed in LRs and expressed on splenic marginal zone (MZ) macrophages. The DC-SIGN-C1q or SIGN-R1-C1q complex could mediate the immunoglobulin (Ig)-independent classical complement pathway against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Precise roles of LRs during this complement pathway are unknown. Here we show that LRs are indispensable for accelerating the DC-SIGN- or SIGN-R1-mediated classical complement pathway against S. pneumoniae, thus facilitating rapid clearance of the pathogen. The trimolecular complex of SIGN-R1-C1q-C4 was exclusively enriched in LRs of splenic MZ macrophages and their localization was essential for activating C3 catabolism and enhancing pneumococcal clearance, which were abolished in SIGN-R1-knockout mice. However, DC-SIGN replacement on splenic MZ macrophage\u2019s LRs of SIGN-R1-depleted mice reversed these defects. Disruption of LRs dramatically reduced pneumococcal uptake and decomposition. Additionally, DC- SIGN, C1q, C4, and C3 were obviously distributed in splenic LRs of cadavers. Therefore, LRs on splenic SIGN-R1(\u002B) or DC-SIGN(\u002B) macrophages could provide spatially confined and optimal bidirectional platforms, not only for usual intracellular events, for example recognition and phagocytosis of pathogens, but also an unusual extracellular event such as the complement system. These findings improve our understanding of the orchestrated roles of the spleen, unraveling a new innate immune system initiated from splenic MZ LRs, and yielding answers to several long-standing problems, including the need to understand the profound role of LRs in innate immunity, the need to identify how such a small portion of splenic SIGN-R1(\u002B) macrophages (\u003C0.05% of splenic macrophages) effectively resist S. pneumoniae, and the need to understand how LRs can promote the protective function of DC-SIGN against S. pneumoniae in the human spleen.","publish_time":"2019-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Seung Woo; Park, Jin-Yeon; Choi, Hyeongjwa; Yun, Tae Jin; Choi, Woo-Sung; Kim, Min-Kyung; Lee, Yun Kyung; Park, Min; Jin, Yihwa; Joo, Jin Soo; Choi, In-Soo; Park, Seung Hwa; Hwang, Han Sung; Kang, Young-Sun","journal":"Cell Death Discov","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/073d6557ccb048fe248c2d4c09a21c33f8632371.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2f32fb8cf3cf8e48df1d344dbdd9dd86a00605cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6733876.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531231/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-019-0213-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DC- SIGN","splenic MZ LRs","splenic MZ macrophage\u2019s LRs of SIGN","DC-SIGN replacement","LRs of splenic MZ macrophages","splenic LRs of cadavers","small portion of splenic SIGN-R1","Disruption of LRs","splenic macrophages","trimolecular complex of SIGN","mouse homolog SIGN-R1","R1-C1q","Precise roles of LRs","profound role of LRs","R1-depleted mice","C1q complex","splenic marginal zone","complement system","protective function of DC","need","independent classical complement pathway","Streptococcus pneumoniae","innate immunity","new innate immune system","crucial roles","human spleen","orchestrated roles","C4","pneumococcal clearance","complex physiological processes","C3 catabolism","immune responses","phagocytosis of pathogens","pneumococcal uptake","rapid clearance","knockout mice","transmembrane C-type lectins human dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule","example recognition","yielding answers","localization","usual intracellular events","immunoglobulin","unusual extracellular event","long-standing problems","nonintegrin","Lipid rafts","optimal bidirectional platforms","understanding","defects","decomposition","findings"],"language":"en"},

The current study is aimed at investigating the public\u0027s perspective about COVID-19, including their knowledge, attitude, and practices. METHODS A rapid online survey comprising 22 items was administered during the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan. Questions were focused on the prevention, transmission, clinical features, and control of COVID-19. In addition, the attitudes and practices of the participants were explored. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and regression analysis were carried out during data analysis. RESULTS A total of 1257 respondents participated in this study. Most of the respondents had good knowledge (good = 64.8%, average = 30.5%, poor = 4.7%) of COVID-19. Gender, marital status, education, and residence were observed to have a significant association with the knowledge score. A vast majority of the survey respondents (77.0%) believed that COVID-19 would be controlled successfully in Pakistan. The practices of wearing a mask (85.8%) and handwashing (88.1%) were common among the participants.

Studies during and after resolution of FPV infection, will be critical to determine if T. foetus co-infection affects long-term prognosis of FPV survivors.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Setyo, Laura; Donahoe, Shannon L.; \u0160lapeta, Jan","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30a46b7621db103ad1bbd0e690ee2eaa34341a20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115762.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401718303984; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401718303984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30878079/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.12.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","FPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["foetus co-infection","resolution of FPV infection","foetus infection intensity","concurrent infection","Abstract Tritrichomonas foetus","FCoV","PCR","long-term prognosis of FPV survivors","feline genotype","concurrent feline enteric coronavirus","feline panleukopenia virus","affected colon","large bowel diarrhoea","cecum","crypts","ileum","lamina propria","occasional invading","waxing","flagellate protist","role","day history of vomiting","lumen","failure","young cats","Assessment of faeces","month-old Bengal kitten","immunosuppression","Protozoa","coughing","Studies"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we investigated the rhinovirus (RV) infection prevalence over a 2-year period, compared it with prevalence patterns of other common respiratory viruses, and explored clinical and molecular epidemiology of RV infections among 590 children hospitalized with acute respiratory infection in north-western and central parts of Croatia. For respiratory virus detection, nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal flocked swabs were taken from each patient and subsequently analyzed with multiplex RT-PCR. To determine the RV species in a subset of positive children, 5\u2032UTR in RV-positive samples has been sequenced. Nucleotide sequences of referent RV strains were retrieved by searching the database with Basic Local Alignment Tool, and used to construct alignments and phylogenetic trees using MAFFT multiple sequence alignment tool and the maximum likelihood method, respectively. In our study population RV was the most frequently detected virus, diagnosed in 197 patients (33.4%), of which 60.4% was detected as a monoinfection. Median age of RV-infected children was 2.25 years, and more than half of children infected with RV (55.8%) presented with lower respiratory tract infections. Most RV cases were detected from September to December, and all three species co-circulated during the analyzed period (2017\u20132019). Sequence analysis based on 5\u2032UTR region yielded 69 distinct strains; the most prevalent was RV-C (47.4%) followed by RV-A (44.7%) and RV-B (7.9%). Most of RV-A sequences formed a distinct phylogenetic group; only strains RI/HR409-18 (along with a reference strain MF978777) clustered with RV-C strains. Strains belonging to the group C were the most diverse (41.6% identity among strains), while group B was the most conserved (71.5% identity among strains). Despite such differences in strain groups (hitherto undescribed in Croatia), clinical presentation of infected children was rather similar. Our results are consistent with newer studies that investigated the etiology of acute respiratory infections, especially those focused on children with lower respiratory tract infections, where RVs should always be considered as potentially serious pathogens.","publish_time":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ljubin-Sternak, Sun\u010Danica; Me\u0161trovi\u0107, Tomislav; Ivkovi\u0107-Jurekovi\u0107, Irena; Kolari\u0107, Branko; Slovi\u0107, Anamarija; For\u010Di\u0107, Dubravko; Tot, Tatjana; Mija\u010D, Maja; Vrane\u0161, Jasmina","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d10f84b9e2232aef0a3d90771b3f861208456d2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6901631.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849887/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Basic Local Alignment Tool"],"locations":["Croatia"],"keyphrases":["RV species","RV-C strains","RV-B","RV cases","molecular epidemiology of RV infections","RV-positive samples","Median age of RV","study population RV","Nucleotide sequences of referent RV strains","distinct strains","severe lower respiratory tract infections","etiology of acute respiratory infections","mild upper respiratory tract infections","half of children","strains RI","respiratory virus detection","clinical presentation of infected children","common respiratory viruses","subset of positive children","group C","group B","detected virus","distinct phylogenetic group","infection prevalence","viral epidemiology of RVs","species diversity","analyzed period","identity","species co-circulated","MAFFT multiple sequence alignment tool","phylogenetic trees","Basic Local Alignment Tool","prevalence patterns","UTR region","Sequence analysis","year period","strain groups","central parts of Croatia","reference strain MF978777","pharyngeal flocked swabs","alignments","maximum likelihood method","database","newer studies","years","results","differences","HR409","multiplex RT-PCR","patients","serious pathogens","Rhinoviruses","monoinfection"],"language":"en"},

This phenomenon reflects the interaction between erythrocytes and viral envelope components. The major virus groups that react with erythrocytes include myxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, pseudomyxoviruses, adenoviruses, arboviruses, reoviruses, enteroviruses, and miscellaneous hemagglutinating viruse (rubella virus, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and oncogenic viruses). The agglutination of erythrocytes by the direct action of viral particles was first described in connection with myxoviruses. This led directly to the discovery of viral neuraminidase\u2014a property unique to myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses. A number of viruses unrelated to myxoviruses have since been shown to agglutinate erythrocytes of various species. The visible result of viral hemagglutination is the \u201Cpattern\u201D formed at the bottom of a test tube or well plate by lattices of red cells lightly conjoined by viral hemagglutinin.

The present paper reports a 3\u2010year cross\u2010sectional hospital\u2010based study aimed at detecting and quantifying HAdV DNA and mRNA of the HAdV hexon gene in adenoid and palatine tonsil tissues and nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) from patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent adenotonsillitis. HAdV C, B, and E were detectable in nearly 50% of the patients, with no association with the severity of airway obstruction, nor with the presence of recurrent tonsillitis, sleep apnea or otitis media with effusion (OME). Despite the higher rates of respiratory viral coinfections in patients with HAdV, the presence of other viruses, including DNA and RNA viruses, had no association with HAdV replication or shedding in secretions. Higher HAdV loads in adenoids showed a significant positive correlation with the presence of sleep apnea and the absence of OME. Although this study indicates that a significant proportion (~85%) of individuals with chronic adenotonsillar diseases have persistent nonproductive HAdV infection, including those by HAdV C, B, and E, epithelial and subepithelial cells in tonsils seem to be critical for HAdV C production and shedding in NPS in some patients, since viral antigen was detected in these regions by immunohistochemistry in four patients, all of which were also positive for HAdV mRNA detection.","publish_time":"2019-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Proenca\u2010Modena, Jos\u00E9 Luiz; de Souza Cardoso, Ricardo; Criado, Miri\u00E3 Ferreira; Milanez, Guilherme Paier; de Souza, William Marciel; Parise, Pierina Lorencini; Bertol, J\u00E9ssica Wildgrube; de Jesus, Bruna Lais Santos; Prates, Mirela Cristina Moreira; Silva, Maria L\u00FAcia; Buzatto, Guilherme Pietrucci; Demarco, Ricardo Cassiano; Valera, Fabiana Cardoso Pereira; Tamashiro, Edwin; Anselmo\u2010Lima, Wilma Terezinha; Arruda, Eurico","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2008305cb68fdc84d5bfec8215b00a09c0e6ced.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166372.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815882/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25441","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPS","OME"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Higher HAdV","HAdV persistence","HAdV replication","HAdV C production","quantifying HAdV DNA","HAdV mRNA detection","patients","HAdV hexon gene","persistent nonproductive HAdV infection","presence of sleep apnea","chronic adenotonsillar diseases","presence of recurrent tonsillitis","NPS","adenotonsillar hypertrophy","association","significant positive correlation","nasopharyngeal secretions","RNA viruses","based study","viral antigen","recurrent adenotonsillitis","absence of OME","significant proportion","higher rates of respiratory viral coinfections","different acute diseases","febrile exudative tonsillitis","palatine tonsil tissues","otitis media","development","year cross\u2010sectional hospital","conjunctivitis","tonsils","effusion","adenoids","pharyngoconjunctival fever","subepithelial cells","regions","role of human adenovirus","individuals","reactivation","severity of airway obstruction","present paper","immunohistochemistry","relationships"],"language":"en"},

Clinicians and health care workers in low-income countries have few tests to diagnose causes of fever other than malaria although several diseases share common symptoms. We propose here to assess etiologies of fever in Madagascar to ultimately improve management of febrile cases. METHODOLOGY: Consenting febrile outpatients aged 6 months and older were recruited in 21 selected sentinel sites throughout Madagascar from April 2014 to September 2015. Standard clinical examinations were performed, and blood and upper respiratory specimens were taken for rapid diagnostic tests and molecular assays for 36 pathogens of interest for Madagascar in terms of public health, regardless of clinical status. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 682 febrile patients were enrolled. We detected at least one pathogen in 40.5% (276/682) of patients and 6.2% (42/682) with co-infections. Among all tested patients, 26.5% (181/682) had at least one viral infection, 17.0% (116/682) had malaria and 1.0% (7/682) presented a bacterial or a mycobacterial infection. None or very few of the highly prevalent infectious agents in Eastern Africa and Asia were detected in this study, such as zoonotic bacteria or arboviral infections. CONCLUSIONS: These results raise questions about etiologies of fever in Malagasy communities. Nevertheless, we noted that viral infections and malaria still represent a significant proportion of causes of febrile illnesses.

With rapid advances in digital technology and mobile health (m-health), future diagnostics should incorporate these elements to give us REASSURED diagnostic systems that can inform disease control strategies in real-time, strengthen the efficiency of health care systems and improve patient outcomes.","publish_time":"2018-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Land, Kevin J.; Boeras, Debrah I.; Chen, Xiang-Sheng; Ramsay, Andrew R.; Peeling, Rosanna W.","journal":"Nat Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdb2516154d753fa0fd6780b4699f929140cec36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7097043.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-018-0295-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546093/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["failure of ASSURED diagnostics","health burden","mobile health","quality diagnostics","development of diagnostics","ASSURED criteria","future diagnostics","efficiency of health care systems","implementation of ASSURED tests","care needs","rapid advances","diagnostic systems","major contributor","past decade","disease control strategies","digital technology","lessons","resource-limited settings","technological innovations","elements","success","patient outcomes","equipment-free","Lack of access","initial publication","factors","additional conditions","years","ideal test","developing world","challenges","point","perspective"],"language":"en"},

In order to track the genetic evolutionary of IBV isolates circulating in yellow chickens, we continued to conduct the genetic analyses of the structural genes S1, E, M, and N from 64 IBV isolates in southern China during 2009\u20132017. The results showed that the dominant genotypes based on the four genes had changed when compared with those during 1985\u20132008. Based on the S1 gene phylogenetic tree, LX4-type (GI-19) was the most dominant genotype, which was different from that during 1985\u20132008. The second most dominant genotype was LDT3-A-type, but this genotype disappeared after 2012. New-type 1 (GVI-1) isolates showed increasing tendency and there were four aa (QKEP) located in the hypervariable region (HVR) III and one aa (S) insertion in all the New-type 1 isolates. Both the analyses of amino acid entropy and molecular evolutionary rate revealed that the variations from large to small were S1, E, M, and N. Purifying selection was detected in the S1, E, M, and N gene proteins, which was different from the positive selection during 1985\u20132008. Six isolates were confirmed to be recombinants, possibly generated from a vaccine virus of the 4/91-type or LDT3-A-type and a circulating virus. The estimated times for the most recent common ancestors based on the S1, E, M, and N genes were the years of 1744, 1893, 1940, and 1945, respectively. Bayesian skyline analysis revealed a sharp decrease in genetic diversity of all the four structural genes after 2010 and since late 2015, the viral population rapidly rose. In conclusion, the IBVs circulating in southern China over the past decade have experienced a remarkable change in genetic diversity, dominant genotypes, and selection pressure, indicating the importance of permanent monitoring of circulating strains and the urgency for developing new vaccines to counteract the emerging LX4-type and New-type IBVs.","publish_time":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Wensheng; Tang, Ning; Dong, Zhihua; Chen, Jiming; Zhang, Wen; Zhao, Changrun; He, Yining; Li, Meng; Wu, Cuilan; Wei, Tianchao; Huang, Teng; Mo, Meilan; Wei, Ping","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0586c9a5cbb333e62fb7e18d5239eae3be34d42a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6833030.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11100898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561498/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["N.

Materials and methods 4 cases of metapneumovirus pneumonia (mean age of 52.3years) in an institutional outbreak (Castle Peak Hospital) in 2008 and 38 cases of SARS-coronovirus (mean age of 39.6years) admitted to Tuen Mun hospital during an epidemic outbreak in 2003 were included. HRCT findings of the lungs for all patients were retrospectively reviewed by two independent radiologists. Results In the metapneumovirus group, common HRCT features were ground glass opacities (100%), consolidation (100%), parenchymal band (100%), bronchiectasis (75%). Crazy paving pattern was absent. They were predominantly subpleural and basal in location and bilateral involvement was observed in 50% of patients. In the SARS group, common HRCT features were ground glass opacities (92.1%), interlobular septal thickening (86.8%), crazy paving pattern (73.7%) and consolidation (68%). Bronchiectasis was not seen. Majority of patient demonstrated segmental or lobar in distribution and bilateral involvement was observed in 44.7% of patients. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were of consistent rare features in both groups. Conclusion Ground glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening and consolidations were consistent HRCT manifestations in both metapneumovirus infection and SARS. The presence of bronchiectasis (0% in SARS) may point towards metapneumovirus while crazy paving pattern is more suggestive of SARS.","publish_time":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Cheuk Kei Kathy; Lai, Vincent; Wong, Yiu Chung","journal":"European Journal of Radiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38a99f0e49b70f41d3774ed3127e06de01dc766f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127279.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.02.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21439753/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X11002361; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X11002361","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Castle Peak Hospital","HRCT","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS group","cases of SARS","SARS-Coronovirus","patients","HRCT findings","metapneumovirus group","suggestive of SARS","common HRCT features","cases of metapneumovirus pneumonia","metapneumovirus infection","Crazy paving pattern","consistent HRCT manifestations","Conclusion Ground glass opacities","consistent rare features","interlobular septal thickening","years","mean age","bilateral involvement","presence of bronchiectasis","institutional outbreak","epidemic outbreak","Tuen Mun hospital","Castle Peak Hospital","initial high resolution computed tomography","severe acute respiratory syndrome","consolidations","review","distribution","lymphadenopathy","location","methods","Majority of patient","Abstract Objective","Pleural effusion","subpleural","groups","Materials","Results","lungs","parenchymal band","independent radiologists"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies suggest that mutation rates are selected for optimal viral fitness and that modest variations in replicase fidelity may be associated with viral attenuation. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are unique in their requirement for host cycling and may necessitate substantial genetic and phenotypic plasticity. In order to more thoroughly investigate the correlates, mechanisms and consequences of arbovirus fidelity, we selected fidelity variants of West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) utilizing selection in the presence of a mutagen. We identified two mutations in the WNV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase associated with increased fidelity, V793I and G806R, and a single mutation in the WNV methyltransferase, T248I, associated with decreased fidelity. Both deep-sequencing and in vitro biochemical assays confirmed strain-specific differences in both fidelity and mutational bias. WNV fidelity variants demonstrated host-specific alterations to replicative fitness in vitro, with modest attenuation in mosquito but not vertebrate cell culture. Experimental infections of colonized and field populations of Cx. quinquefaciatus demonstrated that WNV fidelity alterations are associated with a significantly impaired capacity to establish viable infections in mosquitoes. Taken together, these studies (i) demonstrate the importance of allosteric interactions in regulating mutation rates, (ii) establish that mutational spectra can be both sequence and strain-dependent, and (iii) display the profound phenotypic consequences associated with altered replication complex function of flaviviruses.","publish_time":"2015-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Slyke, Greta A.; Arnold, Jamie J.; Lugo, Alex J.; Griesemer, Sara B.; Moustafa, Ibrahim M.; Kramer, Laura D.; Cameron, Craig E.; Ciota, Alexander T.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/389b75fa8272ae7d2ab3d90ae8c1edbdf55c0463.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4482725.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26114757/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["WNV fidelity variants","WNV fidelity alterations","increased fidelity","replicase fidelity","decreased fidelity","consequences of arbovirus fidelity","mutation rates","WNV methyltransferase","WNV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","fidelity variants of West Nile virus","host-specific alterations","single mutation","modest attenuation","strain-dependent","viral attenuation","strain-specific differences","rapid accumulation of genetic diversity of RNA viruses","optimal viral fitness","High rates of error","profound phenotypic consequences","replicative fitness","host cycling","modest variations","viable infections","phenotypic plasticity","mutational spectra","mutational bias","Recent studies","prone replication result","Experimental infections of colonized","altered replication complex function of flaviviruses","biochemical assays","Flaviviridae","V793I","G806R","T248I","field populations of Cx","selection","arboviruses","correlates","vertebrate cell culture","requirement","impaired capacity","importance of allosteric interactions","mechanisms","deep-sequencing","presence","mosquitoes","mutations","quinquefaciatus","mutagen","Arthropod","order"],"language":"en"},

N-terminal analysis of [3H]isoleucine-labelled M after hydrolysis by bromelain revealed that the first nine residues had been removed.

In Mexico, these plants are traditionally used to alleviate or counteract rheumatism and inflammatory muscle diseases. In the present study we evaluated the activity of aqueous and methanolic extracts of these four plants, on the replication of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2). METHODS: Extraction process was carried out in a Soxtherm\u00AE system at 60, 85 and 120 \u00B0C; a chemical fractionation in silica gel chromatography was performed and compounds present in the active fractions were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn. The cytotoxic concentration and the inhibitory effect of extracts or fractions on the DENV2 replication were analyzed in the BHK-21 cell line (plaque forming assay). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) and the selectivity index (SI) were calculated for the extracts and fractions. RESULTS: The methanolic extracts at 60 \u00B0C of T. officinale and U. dioica showed the higher inhibitory effects on DENV2 replication. After the chemical fractionation, the higher activity fraction was found for U. dioica and T. officinale, presenting IC(50) values of 165.7 \u00B1 3.85 and 126.1 \u00B1 2.80 \u03BCg/ml, respectively; SI values were 5.59 and 6.01 for each fraction. The compounds present in T. officinale, were luteolin and caffeoylquinic acids derivatives and quercertin diclycosides. The compounds in the active fraction of U. dioica, were, chlorogenic acid, quercertin derivatives and flavonol glycosides (quercetin and kaempferol). CONCLUSIONS: Two fractions from U. dioica and T. officinale methanolic extracts with anti-dengue activity were found. The compounds present in both fractions were identified, several recognized molecules have demonstrated activity against other viral species. Subsequent biological analysis of the molecules, alone or in combination, contained in the extracts will be carried out to develop therapeutics against DENV2.","publish_time":"2018-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flores-Ocelotl, Mar\u00EDa R.; Rosas-Murrieta, Nora H.; Moreno, Diego A.; Vallejo-Ruiz, Ver\u00F3nica; Reyes-Leyva, Julio; Dom\u00EDnguez, Fabiola; Santos-L\u00F3pez, Gerardo","journal":"BMC Complement Altern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/131e5a7c8626d4fec5bfe8d77666d1d8556e5a4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5857124.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29548293/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-018-2163-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["officinale methanolic extracts","compounds","DENV2 replication","active fractions","inhibitory effect of extracts","Taraxacum officinale","Urtica dioica","higher activity fraction","activity of aqueous","active fraction of","present study","anti-dengue activity","quercertin derivatives","higher inhibitory effects","chemical fractionation","plants","SI values","half maximal inhibitory concentration","replication of dengue virus serotype","quercertin diclycosides","recognized molecules","cytotoxic concentration","caffeoylquinic acids derivatives","flavonol glycosides","Calea integrifolia","chlorogenic acid","silica gel chromatography","quercetin","BHK","luteolin","Caesalpinia pulcherrima","HPLC-DAD","cell line","plaque","BACKGROUND","world","treatment of different illnesses","rheumatism","inflammatory muscle diseases","assay","ESI","MSn","kaempferol","Subsequent biological analysis","Extraction process","viral species","METHODS","Soxtherm","selectivity index","system","combination","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","\u03BCg","Mexico","therapeutics"],"language":"en"},

METHOD: Two hundred and eighty-nine nasopharyngeal (NP) suction specimens were collected from hospitalized paediatric patients admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand during February 2006\u20132007. Nucleic acids were extracted from each sample with subsequent amplification of VP4/2 by semi-nested RT-PCR for HRV detection. Other viral respiratory pathogens were also detected by PCR, RT-PCR or real time PCR. Nucleotide sequences of the VP4 region were used for genotyping and phylogenetic tree construction. RESULT: In total, 87 of 289 specimens were positive for HRV indicating an annual prevalence of 30%. Wheezing or asthma exacerbation was the most common clinical presentation observed in infected patients. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree showed that 29 (33%) and 8 (9%) specimens belonged to HRV-A and HRV-B, respectively. Most of the HRV positive samples were HRV-C (58%). Moreover, species C was predominantly found in the paediatric population of Thailand in raining season (p \u003C 0.05). The frequency of co-infection of HRV-C with other respiratory viral pathogens was approximately 40%.

Several studies have shown that there exists an interaction between nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) protein. In this paper, we investigate whether the expression of membrane protein can affect the immune responses induced by nucleocapsid DNA immunization. Two recombinant plasmids containing M and N coding sequence were constructed. Moreover, in order to get the antigen for ELISA and in vitro stimulation assay, N protein were expressed and purified from E. coli bacteria. Injection of 20\u03BCg of the mixture of pVAX1-M and pVAX1-N into the Balb/c mice could elicit the humoral and cellular responses. The ELISA analysis using the N antigen or inactivated SARS-CoV particles as capture antigen showed that co-injection of SARS-M could enhance N-induced antibody production, especially IgG2a subclass. After lymphocytes were stimulated with 10\u03BCg/ml purified N antigen, The CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells of N and M plus N group were increased compared with those of control groups, and the M protein could augment the activation of lymphocytes induced by N DNA vaccine. Cytokine ELISA analysis revealed that co-injection of M could enhance the levels of IFN-\u03B3, IL-2 release induced by N antigen. Further experiments in field mouse also support the claim that membrane protein can augment the N-specific immune responses. Virus challenge test was conducted in BSL3 bio safety laboratory with Brandt\u0027s vole SARS-CoV model, and the results indicated that co-immunization of M and N antigens could reduce the mortality and pathological changes in lung from the virus infection.","publish_time":"2006-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Shu-Qun; Peng, Jing-Pian; Li, Yin-Chuan; Qin, Chuan; Liang, Guo-Dong; Xu, Li; Yang, Ying; Wang, Jin-Ling; Sun, Quan-Hong","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb4df91230a99d430331add3f689d2af441b83a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112551.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589005003792; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589005003792","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Brandt"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N protein","pVAX1-N","N antigens","N DNA vaccine","T cells of N","plus N group","N coding sequence","N-specific immune responses","N-induced antibody production","co-injection of SARS","Abstract Nucleocapsid protein","SARS-CoV pathogenesis","expression of membrane protein","capture antigen","inactivated SARS-CoV particles","nucleocapsid DNA immunization","co-immunization","Brandt\u0027s vole SARS-CoV model","Cytokine ELISA analysis","cellular responses","\u03BCg","high-level anti-nucleocapsid antibodies","mixture of pVAX1","virus infection","activation of lymphocytes","Virus challenge test","BSL3 bio safety laboratory","critical role","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","patients","lung","pathological changes","IL","mortality","CD4","CD8","stimulation assay","c mice","IgG2a subclass","claim","Balb","results","release","field mouse","levels of IFN","recombinant plasmids","experiments","control groups","order","interaction","coli bacteria","paper","studies"],"language":"en"},

As a model case, an antibody to Escherichia coli was conjugated with the PAA-coated TiO(2) (TiO(2)-Ab(E)). We evaluated the enhancement of the antibacterial effect of TiO(2)-Ab(E) against target E. coli, compared with its effect on other bacteria that lack affinity for the antibody used. The TiO(2)-Ab(E) inactivated approximately 90% of the E. coli at 15 min, whereas the raw TiO(2) inactivated approximately 20% of the E. coli after the same period of time under UV irradiation. The TiO(2)-Ab(E) did not show an enhanced antibacterial effect against non-target bacteria. We infer that close contact between TiO(2) particles and E. coli, as a result of the specificity of the antibody, can enhance the direct transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by TiO(2) particles to the cellular surface under UV irradiation and result in rapid and efficient inactivation of the targeted bacteria.

The DI cDNA contains the hepatitis delta ribozyme sequences to generate in the transfected cells a defined 3\u2032 end. In EM studies of transfected cells virus-like particles (VLP) were observed in vesicles. Release of the particles into the medium was studied by immunoprecipitations of proteins released into the culture supernatant. Particle release was independent of S or N, but required M and E. Coexpression of E and M was sufficient for particle release. Coexpression of the structural proteins and the MIDI-HD RNA resulted in the production and release of infectious DI-particles. Infectivity of the DI-particles was determined by adding helper virus MHV-A59 to the medium containing the VLPs and using this mixture to infect new L cells. Intracellular RNA of several subsequent undiluted passages was isolated to detect the MIDI-HD RNA. Passage of the MIDI-HD RNA was dependent on the expression of the structural proteins of MHV-A59 in the transfected cells.

Rapid intervention necessitates the capacity to generate, grow, and genetically manipulate infectious CoVs in order to rapidly evaluate pathogenic mechanisms, host and tissue permissibility, and candidate antiviral therapeutic efficacy. CoVs encode the largest viral RNA genomes at about 28\u201332,000 nucleotides in length, and thereby complicate efficient engineering of the genome. Deconstructing the genome into manageable fragments affords the plasticity necessary to rapidly introduce targeted genetic changes in parallel and assort mutated fragments while maximizing genome stability over time. In this protocol we describe a well-developed reverse genetic platform strategy for CoVs that is comprised of partitioning the viral genome into 5\u20137 independent DNA fragments (depending on the CoV genome), each subcloned into a plasmid for increased stability and ease of genetic manipulation and amplification. Coronavirus genomes are conveniently partitioned by introducing type IIS or IIG restriction enzyme recognition sites that confer directional cloning. Since each restriction site leaves a unique overhang between adjoining fragments, reconstruction of the full-length genome can be achieved through a standard DNA ligation comprised of equal molar ratios of each fragment. Using this method, recombinant CoVs can be rapidly generated and used to investigate host range, gene function, pathogenesis, and candidate therapeutics for emerging and preemergent CoVs both in vitro and in vivo.","publish_time":"2017-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cockrell, Adam S.; Beall, Anne; Yount, Boyd; Baric, Ralph","journal":"Reverse Genetics of RNA Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cf3e75deed023c8e64e70f35475b7ac22287700.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120940.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28508214/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6964-7_5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid","IIG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preemergent CoVs","genome stability","viral genome","recombinant CoVs","infectious CoVs","full-length genome","CoV genome","adjoining fragments","mutated fragments","manageable fragments","independent DNA fragments","ease of genetic manipulation","targeted genetic changes","candidate therapeutics","increased stability","host range","restriction site","preemergent coronaviruses","largest viral RNA genomes","immediate intervention","Coronavirus genomes","Rapid intervention","well-developed reverse genetic platform strategy","standard DNA ligation","candidate antiviral therapeutic efficacy","IIG restriction enzyme recognition sites","tissue permissibility","pathogenesis","type IIS","unique overhang","reconstruction","plasticity necessary","equal molar ratios","gene function","pathogenic mechanisms","directional cloning","global threat","plasmid","order","amplification","protocol","efficient engineering","time","capacity","nucleotides","method"],"language":"en"},

Empirical evidence also indicates that the suspension of these services will have costs concerning physical and mental health as well. However, in the case of a pandemic, because it is an infectious disease that is the concern, love of neighbor arguably does entail the suspension of services for the sake of the preservation of life for others. Religious communities and individuals can, and have, found ways to partially offset the losses from not being able to meet. These have included increased personal and family prayer and devotion, video-streaming of services, and online prayer and discussion meetings.

To identify factors that contribute to rSARS-CoV-\u0394E attenuation, gene expression in cells infected by SARS-CoV with or without E gene was compared. Twenty-five stress response genes were preferentially upregulated during infection in the absence of the E gene. In addition, genes involved in signal transduction, transcription, cell metabolism, immunoregulation, inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle and differentiation were differentially regulated in cells infected with rSARS-CoV with or without the E gene. Administration of E protein in trans reduced the stress response in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E or with respiratory syncytial virus, or treated with drugs, such as tunicamycin and thapsigargin that elicit cell stress by different mechanisms. In addition, SARS-CoV E protein down-regulated the signaling pathway inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1) of the unfolded protein response, but not the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) or activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6) pathways, and reduced cell apoptosis. Overall, the activation of the IRE-1 pathway was not able to restore cell homeostasis, and apoptosis was induced probably as a measure to protect the host by limiting virus production and dissemination. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines was reduced in rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-infected cells compared to rSARS-CoV-infected cells, suggesting that the increase in stress responses and the reduction of inflammation in the absence of the E gene contributed to the attenuation of rSARS-CoV-\u0394E.","publish_time":"2011-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeDiego, Marta L.; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Jim\u00E9nez-Guarde\u00F1o, Jose M.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; \u00C1lvarez, Enrique; Oliveros, Juan Carlos; Zhao, Jincun; Fett, Craig; Perlman, Stanley; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f93269b90d3654488b158876258d42402d64afb3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3197621.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22028656/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rSARS-CoV","CoV-\u0394E","SARS-CoV E protein","\u0394E-infected cells","cell stress","attenuation of rSARS","gene expression","Administration of E protein","reduced cell apoptosis","\u0394E attenuation","cell metabolism","cell cycle","cell homeostasis","stress response genes","stress responses","unfolded protein response","respiratory syncytial virus","virus production","addition","absence","IRE","Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus","reduction of inflammation","transcription factor","pathway inositol","expression of proinflammatory cytokines","signal transduction","immunoregulation","PERK","PKR","thapsigargin","increase","host","drugs","tunicamycin","pathways","differentiation","infection","envelope","ER kinase","different mechanisms","ATF","dissemination","enzyme","measure","activation","factors"],"language":"en"},

The network partners agreed that the World Health Organization would coordinate the network and provide a secretariat, which would also function as the operational support team. The network has evolved to comprise 153 institutions/technical partners and 37 additional networks, the latter encompassing a further 355 members and has been directly involved in 137 missions to 79 countries, territories or areas. Future challenges will include supporting countries to achieve the capacity to detect and respond to outbreaks of international concern, as required by the International Health Regulations (2005).

The SEIR compartmental model considers several areas within the hospital where transmission occurred. We use a system of ordinary differential equations that incorporates the following units: emergency department (ED), out-patient clinic, intensive care unit, and hospital wards, where each area has its own carrying capacity and distinguishes the transmission by three individuals in the hospital: patients, health care workers (HCW), or mobile health care workers. The emergency department, as parameterized has a large influence over the epidemic size for both patients and health care workers. Trend of the basic reproduction number (R0), which reached a maximum of 1.39 at the peak of the epidemic and declined to 0.92 towards the end, shows that until added hospital controls are introduced, the outbreak would continue with sustained transmission between wards.

To determine the distribution profile of PEDV outbreak strains, we sequenced the full-length S gene of five samples from two farms where animals exhibited severe diarrhea and high mortality rates. Five new PEDV variants were identified, and the molecular diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and antigenicity analysis of Gansu field samples with other PEDV reference strains were investigated. A series of insertions, deletions, and mutations in the S gene was found in five PEDV variants compared with classical and vaccine strains. These mutations may provide stronger pathogenicity and antigenicity to the new PEDV variants that influenced the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine.

This article describes national trends in seasonal influenza vaccine (IV) coverage in Portugal from 1998/99 to 2010/11, analyzes progress towards meeting WHO 2010 coverage goals, and addresses the effect of major public health threats of the last 12 years (SARS in 2003/04, influenza A (H5N1) in 2005/06, and the influenza A (H1N1)2009 pandemic) on vaccination trends. METHODS: The National Institute of Health surveyed (12 times) a random sample of Portuguese families. IV coverage was estimated and was adjusted for age distribution and country region. Independence of age and sex coverage distribution was tested using a modified F-statistic with a 5% significance level. The effect of SARS, A (H5N1), and the A (H1N1)2009 pandemic was tested using a meta-regression model. The model was adjusted for IV coverage in the general population and in the age groups. RESULTS: Between 1998/99 and 2010/11 IV, coverage in the general population varied between 14.2% (CI (95%): 11.6%\u201316.8%) and 17.5% (CI (95%): 17.6%\u201321.6%). There was no trend in coverage (p = 0.097). In the younger age group (\u003C15 years) a declining trend was identified until 2008/09 (p = 0.005). This trend reversed in 2009/10. There was also a gradual and significant increase in seasonal IV coverage in the elderly (p for trend \u003C 0.001). After 2006/07, IV coverage remained near 50%. Adjusting for baseline trends, there was significantly higher coverage in the general population in 2003/04 (p = 0.032) and 2005/06 (p = 0.018). The high coverage observed in the \u003C15-year age group in season 2009/10 was also significant (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: IV coverage in the elderly population displayed an increasing trend, but the 75% WHO 2010 target was not met. This result indicates that influenza vaccination strategy should be improved to meet the ambitious WHO coverage goals. The major pandemic threats of the past decade had a modest but significant effect on seasonal influenza vaccination.

Small intestinal inflammation is considered a central event in the pathogenesis of TGEV infections, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03BAB) is a key transcription factor in the inflammatory response. However, it is unclear whether NF-\u03BAB is crucial for inducing inflammation during a TGEV infection. Our results show that NF-\u03BAB was activated in swine testicular (ST) cells and intestinal epithelial cell lines J2 (IPEC-J2) cells infected with TGEV, which is consistent with the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of TGEV-infected ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells with the NF-\u03BAB-specific inhibitor caused the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, but did not significantly affect TGEV replication. Individual TGEV protein screening results demonstrated that Nsp2 exhibited a high potential for activating NF-\u03BAB and enhancing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Functional domain analyzes indicated that the first 120 amino acid residues of Nsp2 were essential for NF-\u03BAB activation. Taken together, these data suggested that NF-\u03BAB activation was a major contributor to TGEV infection-induced inflammation, and that Nsp2 was the key viral protein involved in the regulation of inflammation, with amino acids 1\u2013120 playing a critical role in activating NF-\u03BAB.

We observed that TGEVs could be internalized through clathrin\u2010 and caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis, and the internalization of TGEVs was almost completed within ~2 minutes after TGEVs attached to the cell membrane.

Anesthesiologists are exposed to a risk for infection when they are involved in airway instrumentation of infected patients. Given the evidence of emerging resistance to common antiviral agents used to treat H5N1 influenza virus and limited supply of H5N1 vaccine, prevention is our best protection. The following article will detail the virology and preventive public health practices for H5N1. This knowledge can also be used to define and prevent other yet unidentified infectious threats.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edler, Alice A.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Anesthesia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31d3160dbbc1b93458f5355ba6261b3822cd9e4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135818.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952818005003557; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952818005003557","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["subtype H5N1","H5N1 influenza virus","Abstract Avian flu","limited supply of H5N1 vaccine","probable human","human transmission","preventive public health practices","common antiviral agents","virology","prevention","current outbreak","Asia","evidence of emerging resistance","safety","virulent disease","best protection","airway instrumentation of infected patients","harbinger","world community","following article","humans","risk","unidentified infectious threats","birds","global epidemic","infection","viruses","Anesthesiologists","mammals","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Gen. Virol. 66, 719\u2013726). The order of the two glycopolypeptides within So is aminoterminus(N)-Sl-S2-carboxyterminus(C). To locate the N-terminus of S2 we have performed partial amino acid sequencing on S2 from IBV-Beaudette labelled with [3H]serine and from the related strain IBV-M41 labelled with [3H]valine, leucine and isoleucine. The residues identified and their positions relative to the N-terminus of S2 were: serine, 13; valine, 6, 12; leucine, none in the first 20 residues; isoleucine, 2, 19. These results identified the N-terminus of S2 of IBV-Beaudette as serine, 520 residues from the N-terminus of S1, excluding the signal sequence. Immediately to the N-terminal side of residue 520 So has the sequence Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg; similar basic connecting peptides are a feature of several other virus spike glycoproteins. It was deduced that for IBV-Beaudette SI comprises 519 residues (M r 57.0K) or 514 residues (56.2K) if the connecting peptide was to be removed by carboxypeptidase-like activity in vivo while S2 has 625 residues (69.2K). Nucleotide sequencing of the cleavage region of the So gene of IBV-M41 revealed the same connecting peptide as IBV-Beaudette and that the first 20 N-terminal residues of S2 of IBV-M41 were identical to those of the Beaudette strain. IBV-Beaudette grown in Vero cells had some uncleaved So; this was cleavable by 10 \u03BCg/ml of trypsin and of chymotrypsin. Partial N-terminal analysis of S1 from IBV-M41 identified leucine and valine residues at positions 2 and 9 respectively from the N-terminus. This confirms the identification made by Binns et al. (1985), of the N-terminus of S1 and the end of the signal sequence of the IBV-Beaudette spike propolypeptide. N-terminal sequencing of [3H]leucine-labelled IBV-Beaudette membrane (M) polypeptide showed leucine residues at positions 8,16 and 22 from the N-terminus; these results confirm the open reading frame identified by M.E.G.

Coiled-coil proteins exhibit a large diversity of function (e.g. gene regulation, cell division, membrane fusion, drug extrusion) thus demonstrating the significance of oligomerization in biological systems. The classical coiled-coil domain comprises a series of consecutive heptad repeats in the protein sequence that are readily identifiable by the location of hydrophobic residues at the \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019 positions. This gives rise to an \u03B1-helical structure in which between 2 and 7 helices are wound around each other in the form of a left-handed supercoil. More recently, structures of coiled-coil domains have been solved that have an 11 residue (undecad) or a 15 residue (pentadecad) repeat, which show the formation of a right-handed coiled-coil structure. The high stability of coiled coils, together with the presence of large internal cavities in the pentameric coiled-coil domain of cartilage oligomerization matrix protein (COMPcc) and the tetrameric right-handed coiled coil of Staphylothermus marinus (RHCC) has led us and others to look for therapeutic applications. In this review, we present evidence in support of a vitamin A and vitamin D3 binding activity for the pentameric COMPcc molecule. In addition, we will discuss exciting new developments which show that the RHCC tetramer is capable of binding the major anticancer drug cisplatin and the ability to fuse it to an antigenic epitope for the development of a new generation of vaccines.","publish_time":"2009-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"McFarlane, Ainsley A.; Orriss, George L.; Stetefeld, J\u00F6rg","journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f79398d17ad6a77012eeff897057f3a199eb200.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094320.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299909008759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19835864/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.05.034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299909008759","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coiled-coil motif","right-handed coiled-coil structure","coil proteins","classical coiled-coil domain","structures of coiled","coil domains","tetrameric right-handed coiled coil of Staphylothermus marinus","coil domain of cartilage oligomerization matrix protein","high stability of coiled coils","oligomerization of proteins","significance of oligomerization","protein sequences","pentameric COMPcc molecule","vitamin D3 binding activity","drug extrusion","RHCC tetramer","large diversity of function","exciting new developments","new generation of vaccines","\u03B1-helical structure","major anticancer drug cisplatin","presence of large internal cavities","gene regulation","cell division","membrane fusion","series of consecutive heptad repeats","support","present evidence","formation","location of hydrophobic residues","review","antigenic epitope","rise","biological systems","specific manner","pentadecad","addition","undecad","therapeutic applications","helices","positions"],"language":"en"},

Th2 cells are predominantly involved in mild asthma, whereas a mixture of Th1 and Th2 cells with neutrophilic inflammation, probably induced by Th17, affects more severe asthmatic disease. Exacerbation of asthmatic inflammation is often triggered by airway\u2010targeting RNA viral infection; virus\u2010derived double\u2010stranded RNA, Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR)3 ligand, activates bronchial epithelial cells to produce pro\u2010inflammatory mediators, including TSLP. Objective Because TSLPR\u2010expressing DCs express TLR3, we examined how the relationship between TSLP and TLR3 ligand stimulation influences DC activation. Methods CD11c(\u002B)DCs purified from adult peripheral blood were cultured in TLR ligands containing media with or without TSLP and then co\u2010cultured with allogeneic na\u00EFve CD4(\u002B)T cells. Results CD11c(\u002B) DCs responded to a combination of TSLP and TLR3 ligand, poly(I : C), to up\u2010regulate expression of the functional TSLP receptor and TLR3. Although TSLP alone did not induce IL\u201023 production by DCs, poly(I : C) alone primed DCs for the production of IL\u201023, and a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed DCs for further production of IL\u201023. The addition of poly(I : C) did not inhibit TSLP\u2010activated DCs to prime na\u00EFve CD4(\u002B) T cells to differentiate into inflammatory Th2 cells. Furthermore, DCs activated by a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed more na\u00EFve CD4(\u002B) T cells to differentiate into Th17\u2010cytokine\u2013producing cells with a central memory T cell phenotype compared with DCs activated by poly(I : C) alone. Conclusions These results suggest that through DC activation, human TSLP and TLR3 ligands promote differentiation of Th17 cells with the central memory T cell phenotype under Th2\u2010polarizing conditions.","publish_time":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tanaka, J.; Watanabe, N.; Kido, M.; Saga, K.; Akamatsu, T.; Nishio, A.; Chiba, T.","journal":"Clin Exp Allergy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7a3db768fbae9595890043e86bdec9de4d1227c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164823.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2222.2008.03151.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19055649/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TSLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","human TSLP","combination of TSLP","primed DCs","activated DCs","inflammatory Th2 cells","dendritic cells","DCs express TLR3","functional TSLP receptor","differentiation of Th17 cells","bronchial epithelial cells","TLR3 ligands","proallergic T","addition of poly","central memory T cell phenotype","production of IL","human asthmatic lung","TLR3 ligand stimulation influences DC activation","allogeneic na\u00EFve CD4","pathophysiology of human asthma","cell responses","TLR ligands","Exacerbation of asthmatic inflammation","Results CD11c","severe asthmatic disease","Background Human thymic stromal lymphopoietin","stranded RNA","neutrophilic inflammation","mild asthma","Methods CD11c","RNA viral infection","pro\u2010inflammatory mediators","derived double","virus","Toll","helper type","mixture of Th1","airway","relationship","adult peripheral blood","critical role","polarizing conditions","TSLPR","cytokine","Objective","expression","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

In recent years, the use of RNAi for therapeutic applications has gained considerable momentum. It has been suggested that most of the novel disease-associated targets that have been identified are not \u2018druggable\u2019 with conventional approaches. However, any disease-causing gene and any cell type or tissue can potentially be targeted with RNAi. This review focuses on the current knowledge of RNAi mechanisms and the safety issues associated with its potential use in a therapeutic setting. Some of the most important aspects to consider when working towards the application of RNAi-based products in a clinical setting have been related to achieving high efficacies and enhanced stability profiles through a careful design of the nucleic acid sequence and the introduction of chemical modifications, but most of all, to developing improved delivery systems, both viral and non-viral. These new delivery systems allow for these products to reach the desired target cells, tissues or organs in a highly specific manner and after administration of the lowest possible doses. Various routes of application and target locations are currently being addressed in order to develop effective delivery systems for different targets and pathologies, including infectious pathologies, genetic pathologies and diseases associated with dysregulation of endogenous microRNAs. As with any new technology, several challenges and important aspects to be considered have risen on the road to clinical intervention, e.g. correct design of preclinical toxicology studies, regulatory concerns, and intellectual property protection. The main advantages related to the use of RNAi-based products in a clinical setting, and the latest clinical and preclinical studies using these compounds, are reviewed.","publish_time":"2012-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00F3pez-Fraga, Marta; Mart\u00EDnez, Tamara; Jim\u00E9nez, Ana","journal":"BioDrugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/478dd98749291f192b9ce6b8e68c5acf909415b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099360.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19754220/; https://doi.org/10.2165/11318190-000000000-00000","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of RNAi","application of RNAi","clinical setting","new delivery systems","based products","clinical intervention","therapeutic setting","effective delivery systems","improved delivery systems","current knowledge of RNAi mechanisms","infectious pathologies","genetic pathologies","gene expression","preclinical studies","gene silencing","potential use","disease-causing gene","important aspects","novel disease-associated targets","correct design of preclinical toxicology studies","careful design","different targets","target locations","stage of translation","specific manner","therapeutic applications","new technology","nucleic acid sequence","precise mechanism of sequence","desired target cells","specific messenger RNAs","Various routes of application","regulatory concerns","diseases","enhanced stability profiles","organs","safety issues","natural cellular process","administration","tissues","high efficacies","intellectual property protection","introduction of chemical modifications","cell type","challenges","order","dysregulation of endogenous microRNAs","considerable momentum","lowest possible doses","road","recent years","compounds","RNA interference","main advantages","conventional approaches","review"],"language":"en"},

However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number in populations where an endemic disease is sustained by a combination of local transmission within the population and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases (since R 0 \u003C 1 ), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show that in the simplest case, R 0 \u003C 1 if and only if the proportion of infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two case studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted, highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction number \u003C1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0% of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"McLure, Angus; Glass, Kathryn","journal":"Theor Popul Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8d9a4d152c7d7dcbc69abe7427c586a42cda661.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159883.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2020.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580920300319; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040580920300319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304644/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reservoir exposure","population heterogeneity","general human population accounting","animal populations","imported cases","basic reproduction number","importation-driven disease","disease extinction","disease prevalence","endemic disease","isolated populations","study hospital","animal reservoirs","case studies of Clostridium difficile infection","diseases","simple rules","external source","transmissible NAP1","simplest case","proportion of infections","combination of local transmission","landmark study of hospitalised patients","survival","colonisation","threshold parameter","interactions of multiple strains","RT027 strain of","compartmental models","infected admissions","Abstract","humans","idea"],"language":"en"},

Peripheral constitution of human immunity in SCID or Rag(null) mice has been achieved by transplantation of mature human immune cells, foetal human thymus, bone marrow, liver tissues, lymph nodes or a combination of these, although efficiency needs to be improved. These mouse models with constituted human immunity (defined as humanized mice in the present text) have been widely used to investigate the basic principles of human immunobiology as well as complex pathomechanisms and potential therapies of human diseases.

The WBC count and CRP level of patients over 18 years of age who visited the ED because of or with fever were recorded. Patients who had normal WBC count (4,000\u201310,000/mL) and high CRP level (\u003E 100 mg/L) were included. The data, including gender, age and length of hospital stay, were reviewed. Underlying diseases, diagnosis of the febrile disease and final condition were recorded according to the chart. Within the study period, 54,078 patients visited our ED. Of 5,628 febrile adults, 214 (3.8%) had elevated CRP level and normal WBC count. The major cause of febrility was infection (82.24%). Most of these patients were admitted (92.99%). There were 32 patients with malignant neoplasm, nine with liver cirrhosis, 66 with diabetes mellitus and 11 with uremia. There were no significant differences in age and gender between patients with and those without neoplasm. However, a higher inhospital mortality rate and other causes of febrility were noted in patients with neoplasm. It was not rare in febrile patients who visited the ED to have a high CRP level but normal WBC count. These patients did not necessarily have an underlying malignant neoplasm or hematologic illness. Factors other than malignant neoplasm or hematologic illness may be associated with the WBC response, and CRP may be a better indicator of infection under such conditions.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Kuan-Ting; Lin, Tzeng-Jih; Chan, Hon-Man","journal":"The Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a8c94e2a134c4569c100a761e2b3236151b40c3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s1607-551x(08)70149-9; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1607551X08701499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18508422/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1607551X08701499","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["WBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["febrile patients","CRP level of patients","normal WBC count","elevated CRP level","high CRP level","WBC response","common chief complaints of patients","underlying malignant neoplasm","febrile disease","previous underlying disease of impaired WBC functioning","febrile adults","Underlying diseases","gender","bacterial infection","years of age","hematologic illness","Fever","normal white blood cell","better indicator of infection","causes of febrility","major cause of febrility","elevated C-reactive protein","levels","liver cirrhosis","diagnosis","higher inhospital mortality rate","emergency departments","diabetes mellitus","counts","final condition","significant differences","conditions","length of hospital","Factors","uremia","data","study period","chart"],"language":"en"},

Its infectivity was slightly reduced at pH 3.0. The virus passed through a membrane filter of 200 nm pore size, but not through one of 100 nm pore size. The buoyant density of the virus was determined in a sucrose density gradient. The peak of infectivity and hemagglutinin activity was found at a density of 1.182.

Thus, the identification of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) in 1996 in a debilitated bat found by a member of the public precipitated both public health consternation and a revision of lyssavirus taxonomy. Subsequent observational studies sought to elaborate the occurrence and frequency of ABLV infection in Australian bats. This paper describes the taxonomic diversity of bat species showing evidence of ABLV infection to better inform public health considerations. Blood and/or brain samples were collected from two cohorts of bats (wild-caught and diagnostic submissions) from four Australian states or territories between April 1996 and October 2002. Fresh brain impression smears were tested for ABLV antigen using fluorescein-labelled anti-rabies monoclonal globulin (CENTOCOR) in a direct fluorescent antibody test; sera were tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies using a rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. A total of 3,217 samples from 2,633 bats were collected and screened: brain samples from 1,461 wild-caught bats and 1086 submitted bats from at least 16 genera and seven families, and blood samples from 656 wild-caught bats and 14 submitted bats from 14 genera and seven families. Evidence of ABLV infection was found in five of the six families of bats occurring in Australia, and in three of the four Australian states/territories surveyed, supporting the historic presence of the virus in Australia. While the infection prevalence in the wild-caught cohort is evidently low, the significantly higher infection prevalence in rescued bats in urban settings represents a clear and present public health significance because of the higher risk of human exposure.","publish_time":"2018-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Field, Hume Ernest","journal":"Zoonoses and Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/081b825afbb363f2ad10098c464e31dc650debd1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6249124.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12480; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/zph.12480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29785730/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABLV"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["Australian bats","families of bats","rescued bats","cohorts of bats","evidence of ABLV infection","frequency of ABLV infection","brain samples","ABLV antigen","higher infection prevalence","Australian states","blood samples","public health consternation","public health considerations","identification of Australian bat lyssavirus","present public health significance","free of rabies","debilitated bat","territories","genera","anti-rabies monoclonal globulin","direct fluorescent antibody test","taxonomic diversity of bat species","historic presence","Fresh brain impression smears","rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test","presence of neutralising antibodies","revision of lyssavirus taxonomy","higher risk of human exposure","CENTOCOR","urban settings","fluorescein","sera","occurrence","member","diagnostic submissions","paper","Subsequent observational studies","viruses","total"],"language":"en"},

ADEM is considered an autoimmune disorder that is triggered by an environmental stimulus in genetically susceptible individuals. The diagnosis of ADEM is based on clinical and radiological features. Most children with ADEM initially present with fever, meningeal signs, and acute encephalopathy. The level of consciousness ranges from lethargy to frank coma. Deep and subcortical white-matter lesions and gray-matter lesions such as thalami and basal ganglia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are associated with ADEM. In a child who presents with signs of encephalitis, bacterial and viral meningitis or encephalitis must be ruled out. Sequential MRI is required to confirm the diagnosis of ADEM, as relapses with the appearance of new lesions on MRI may suggest either multiphasic ADEM or multiple sclerosis (MS). Pediatric MS, defined as onset of MS before the age of 16, is being increasingly recognized. MS is characterized by recurrent episodes of demyelination in the CNS separated in space and time. The McDonald criteria for diagnosis of MS include evidence from MRI and allow the clinician to make a diagnosis of clinically definite MS on the basis of the interval preceding the development of new white matter lesions, even in the absence of new clinical findings. The most important alternative diagnosis to MS is ADEM. At the initial presentation, the 2 disorders cannot be distinguished with certainty. Therefore, prolonged follow-up is needed to establish a diagnosis.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Yun Jin","journal":"Korean J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15d061338f90460e59acb68d6cd52f5e776e53c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3174358.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21949517/; https://doi.org/10.3345/kjp.2011.54.6.234","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ADEM"],"organizations":["CNS","McDonald"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of ADEM","diagnosis of MS","multiphasic ADEM","onset of MS","definite MS","Pediatric MS","gray-matter lesions","appearance of new lesions","important alternative diagnosis","development of new white matter lesions","subcortical white-matter lesions","Sequential MRI","signs of encephalitis","CNS","acute encephalopathy","absence of new clinical findings","meningeal signs","monophasic disorder","autoimmune disorder","Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis","thalami","basal ganglia","fever","magnetic resonance imaging","demyelinating disease","lethargy","central nervous system","multifocal neurologic symptoms","interval","evidence","relapses","viral meningitis","level of consciousness ranges","frank coma","basis","recurrent episodes of demyelination","multiple sclerosis","environmental stimulus","McDonald criteria","disorders","susceptible individuals","space","children","clinician","radiological features","initial presentation","time","age","prolonged follow-up","certainty"],"language":"en"},

As multifunctional heterodimeric cell-surface receptor molecules, integrins have been shown to usefully serve as entry receptors for a plethora of viruses. However, the exact role(s) of integrins in viral pathogen internalization has yet to be elaborately described. Notably, several viruses harbor integrin-recognition motifs displayed on viral envelope/capsid-associated proteins. The most common of these motifs is the minimal peptide sequence for binding integrins, RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp), which is known for its role in virus infection via its ability to interact with over half of the more than 20 known integrins. Not all virus-integrin interactions are RGD-dependent, however. Non-RGD-binding integrins have also been shown to effectively promote virus entry and infection as well. Such virus-integrin binding is shown to facilitate adhesion, cytoskeleton rearrangement, integrin activation, and increased intracellular signaling. Also, we have attempted to discuss the role of carbohydrate moieties in virus interactions with receptor-like host cell surface integrins that drive the process of internalization. As much as possible, this article examines the published literature regarding the role of integrins in terms of virus infection and virus-encoded glycosylated proteins that mediate interactions with integrins, and it explores the idea of targeting these receptors as a therapeutic treatment option.","publish_time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hussein, Hosni A.

In total, 114 surface and 62 air samples were collected. Bacterial contamination was very low (\u003C1cfu/cm2) on surfaces, whereas the \u2018medium\u2019 detected value in air was 282cfu/m3. Overall, 19 (16.7%) surface samples tested positive for viral nucleic acids: one for norovirus, one for human adenovirus and 17 (14.9%) for torque teno virus (TTV). Only this latter virus was directly detected in 10 air samples (16.1%). Haemoglobin was found on two surfaces. No relationship was found between viral, biochemical or bacterial indicators.

In the present study, one 18-month-old Sand cat (FM019) died of acute toxoplasmosis-associated hepatitis and pneumonitis acquired after birth; Toxoplasma gondii was demonstrated in histological sections which reacted with T. gondii polyclonal antibodies by immunohistochemistry (IHC). T. gondii DNA was found by PCR of extracted DNA from liver and lung tissues of this cat. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in serum examined in 1:1600 dilution in the modified agglutination test (MAT); its 2-year-old cage mate seroconverted (MAT titer 1:3200) at the same time. Another Sand cat (FM017) was euthanized because of ill health when 3 years old; its MAT titer was \u003E1:3200, and T. gondii tissue cysts were found in brain, heart, ocular muscles and skeletal muscle, confirmed by IHC. Viable T. gondii was isolated by bioassays in mice inoculated with tissues of another chronically infected Sand cat (FM002); T. gondii was not found in histological sections of this cat. T. gondii antibodies were found in several species of animals tested, notably in 49 of 57 wild felids at BCEAW. A 7-year-old Sand cat (3657) from Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation (AWWP), Doha, State of Qatar died of acute visceral toxoplasmosis with demonstrable T. gondii tachyzoites by IHC, and T. gondii DNA by PCR, and a MAT titer of \u003E3200. T. gondii antibodies were found in 21 of 27 of wild felids at AWWP. PCR-RFLP genotyping at 10 genetic loci revealed that these T. gondii isolates from Sand cat (FM002 and FM019) at BCEAW have an atypical genotype, which was previously reported in T. gondii isolates of dogs from Sri Lanka. The genotype from the cat from AWWP (3657) is a genetic Type II strain with a Type I allele at locus Apico. This is the first report of genetic characterization of T. gondii isolates from Middle East.","publish_time":"2010-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dubey, J.

Polymorphism of MBL and MASP-2 genes may affect the serum concentration of MBL and MASP-2. This study explores the association between MBL and MASP-2 gene polymorphism and their interactions and the susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). METHOD: A total of 503 patients with TB and 419 healthy controls were recruited to participate in this case-control study. PCR-SSP technology was applied to genotype rs7096206 of MBL genes and rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes. Demographic data and some exposure information were also obtained from study participants. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify association between the various factors and TB whilst Marginal Structural Linear Odds Models were used to estimate the interactions. RESULTS: Both genotype GC at rs7096206 of MBL genes and genotype TC at rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes were more prevalent in the TB patient group than the healthy control group (P \u003C 0.05, OR 1.393, 1.302 and 1.426 respectively).

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We followed 578 people in Southwest China for up to five years. Participants were tested for Schistosoma japonicum infection in stool and seven standard measures of the liver and spleen were obtained using ultrasound to evaluate the relationship between schistosomiasis infection and ultrasound-detectable pathology, and the impact of targeted treatment on morbidity. Parenchymal fibrosis, a network pattern of the liver unique to S. japonicum, was associated with infection at the time of ultrasound (OR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.03\u20131.90) and infection intensity (test for trend, p = 0.002), adjusting for age, sex and year, and more strongly associated with prior infection status and intensity (adjusted OR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.30\u20132.60; test for trend: p\u003C0.001 respectively), despite prompt treatment of infections. While declines in parenchymal fibrosis over time were statistically significant, only 28% of individuals with severe parenchymal fibrosis (grades 2 or 3) at enrollment reversed to normal or grade 1 within five years. Other liver abnormalities were less consistently associated with S. japonicum infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Parenchymal fibrosis is an appropriate measure of S. japonicum morbidity and can document reductions in disease following control efforts. Other ultrasound measures may have limited epidemiological value in regions with similar infection levels. Because severe fibrosis may not reverse quickly following treatment, efforts to reduce exposure to S. japonicum should be considered in combination with treatment to prevent schistosomiasis morbidity.","publish_time":"2010-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carlton, Elizabeth J.; Hsiang, Michelle; Zhang, Yi; Johnson, Sarah; Hubbard, Alan; Spear, Robert C.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4922ec2dbaef5cf37c816d3b8bf8ef2003466949.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2872638.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20502515/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000685","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southwest China"],"keyphrases":["schistosomiasis infection","infection intensity","japonicum morbidity","Schistosoma japonicum infection","severe parenchymal fibrosis","severe fibrosis","similar infection levels","ultrasound measures","prior infection status","time of ultrasound","understanding of schistosomiasis morbidity","liver unique","liver abnormalities","ultrasound-detectable pathology","spleen","test","impact of targeted treatment","trend","prompt treatment of infections","years","standard measures","control efforts","epidemiological value","appropriate measure","regions","non-invasive examination","reductions","grades","individuals","stool","network pattern","people","disease","SIGNIFICANCE","combination","relationship","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","enrollment","BACKGROUND","Ultrasonography","Southwest China","CONCLUSIONS","Participants","exposure","age","sex","METHODOLOGY"],"language":"en"},

Novel pathogens continue to evolve and emerge. Public health innovation has the potential to open a new front in the war of \u201Cour wits against their genes\u201D (Joshua Lederberg). Dense sampling coupled to next generation sequencing can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of microbial characterization while sensor technologies precisely map physical parameters relevant to microbial survival and spread. Microbial, physical, and epidemiological big data could be combined to improve prospective risk identification. However, applied in the wrong way, these approaches may not realize their maximum potential benefits and could even do harm. Minimizing microbial-human interactions would be a mistake. There is evidence that microbes previously thought of at best \u201Cbenign\u201D may actually enhance human health. Benign and health-promoting microbiomes may, or may not, spread via mechanisms similar to pathogens. Infectious vaccines are approaching readiness to make enhanced contributions to herd immunity. The rigorously defined nature of infectious vaccines contrasts with indigenous \u201Cbenign or health-promoting microbiomes\u201D but they may converge. A \u201Cmicrobial Neolithic revolution\u201D is a possible future in which human microbial-associations are understood and managed analogously to the macro-agriculture of plants and animals. Tradeoffs need to be framed in order to understand health-promoting potentials of benign, and/or health-promoting microbiomes and infectious vaccines while also discouraging pathogens. Super-spreaders are currently defined as individuals who play an outsized role in the contagion of infectious disease. A key unanswered question is whether the super-spreader concept may apply similarly to health-promoting microbes.

However, some patients developed severe lower-respiratory tract infections with fatal consequences, and the cause of these infections remain unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that different populations have different degrees of susceptibility to pH1N1 strains due to host genetic variations that are associated with inappropriate immune responses against viral genetic characteristics. Here, we tested whether the pathologic patterns of influenza strains that produce different disease outcomes in humans could be reproduced in a ferret model. Our results revealed that the severities of infection did not correspond to particular viral isolate and were not associated with the clinical phenotypes of the corresponding patients. Severe pathological outcomes were associated with higher viral replication, especially in alveolar areas, and with an exacerbated innate cellular immune response that was characterised by substantial phagocytic and cytotoxic cell migration into the lungs. Moreover, detrimental innate cellular responses were linked to the up-regulation of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the down-regulation of IFN\u03B1 in the lungs. Additionally, severe lung lesions were associated with greater up-regulations of pro-apoptotic markers and higher levels of apoptotic neutrophils and macrophages. In conclusion, this study confirmed that the clinicopathological outcomes of pH1N1 infection in ferrets were not only due to viral replication abilities but also depended on the hosts\u2019 capacities to mount efficient immune responses to control viral infection of the lung.

Reasons as to why Kudus appear to be exceptionally susceptible to rabies still remain speculative at best. Because the current severe rabies endemic in Kudus continues to have an enormous negative impact on the Namibian agricultural sector, we set out to question existing dogmas regarding the epidemiology of the disease in a unique experimental setting. In addition, we explored effective measures to protect these antelopes. Although we were able to confirm high susceptibly of kudus for rabies and sporadic horizontal rabies virus transmission to contact animals, we contend that these observations cannot plausibly explain the rapid spread of the disease in Kudus over large territories. Since parenteral vaccination of free-roaming Kudus is virtually impossible, oral rabies vaccination using modified life virus vaccines with a high safety profile would be the ultimate solution to the problem. In a proof-of-concept study using a 3rd generation oral rabies virus vaccine construct (SPBN GASGAS) we found evidence that Kudus can be vaccinated by the oral route and protected against a subsequent rabies infection. In a second phase, more targeted studies need to be initiated by focusing on optimizing oral vaccine uptake and delivery.","publish_time":"2018-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassel, Rainer; Vos, Ad; Clausen, Peter; Moore, Susan; van der Westhuizen, Jolandie; Khaiseb, Siegfried; Kabajani, Juliet; Pfaff, Florian; H\u00F6per, Dirk; Hundt, Boris; Jago, Mark; Bruwer, Floris; Lindeque, Pauline; Finke, Stefan; Freuling, Conrad M.; M\u00FCller, Thomas","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31d093e41e871ccc4472ec4bcfccb4a94a46653e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6226427.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30413745/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34985-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["southern Africa","Namibia"],"keyphrases":["oral rabies vaccination","roaming Kudus","subsequent rabies infection","generation oral rabies virus vaccine construct","sporadic horizontal rabies virus transmission","current severe rabies endemic","oral route","oral vaccine uptake","disease","modified life virus vaccines","high safety profile","parenteral vaccination of free","unique experimental setting","SPBN GASGAS","Tragelaphus strepsiceros","enormous negative impact","animals","Namibian agricultural sector","ultimate solution","Greater Kudu","concept study","epidemiology","rapid spread","effective measures","observations","evidence","delivery","large territories","existing dogmas","phase","targeted studies","addition","antelopes","problem","proof","best","southern Africa","magnitude","Reasons"],"language":"en"},

Thus, a rapid and reliable method is required for epidemiological investigations and to evaluate the effect of immunization. However, the current diagnostic methods for PEDV are time-consuming and very expensive and rarely meet the requirements for clinical application. Nanobodies have been used in the clinic to overcome these problems because of the advantages of their easy expression and high level of stability. In the present work, a novel biotinylated nanobody-based blocking ELISA (bELISA) was developed to detect anti-PEDV antibodies in clinical pig serum. RESULTS: Using phage display technology and periplasmic extraction ELISA (PE-ELISA), anti-PEDV N protein nanobodies from three strains of PEDV were successfully isolated after three consecutive rounds of bio-panning from a high quality phage display VHH library. Then, purified Nb2-Avi-tag fusion protein was biotinylated in vitro. A novel bELISA was subsequently developed for the first time with biotinylated Nb2. The cutoff value for bELISA was 29.27%. One hundred and fifty clinical serum samples were tested by both newly developed bELISA and commercial kits. The sensitivity and specificity of bELISA were 100% and 93.18%, respectively, and the coincidence rate between the two methods was 94%. CONCLUSIONS: In brief, bELISA is a rapid, low-cost, reliable and useful nanobody-based tool for the serological evaluation of current PEDV vaccines efficacy and indirect diagnosis of PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2019-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Zhiqian; Wang, Tianyu; Li, Zhiwei; Guo, Xuyang; Tian, Yangsheng; Li, Yang; Xiao, Shuqi","journal":"J Nanobiotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d44554968fffa118597a03b93a4a3fa6150d8895.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6745792.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-019-0531-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","VHH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed bELISA","strains of PEDV","novel bELISA","specificity of bELISA","anti-PEDV antibodies","anti-PEDV N protein nanobodies","indirect diagnosis of PEDV infection","biotinylated Nb2","serological evaluation of current PEDV vaccines efficacy","novel biotinylated nanobody-based blocking ELISA","PE-ELISA","high mortality rate","clinical pig serum","clinical serum samples","clinical application","periplasmic extraction ELISA","phage display technology","high quality phage display VHH library","high level of stability","current diagnostic methods","useful nanobody-based tool","reliable method","Nb2-Avi","coincidence rate","tag fusion protein","severe watery diarrhea","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","pork industry","piglets","dehydration","easy expression","enormous economic losses","epidemiological investigations","BACKGROUND","advantages","present work","problems","large challenge","consecutive rounds of bio","requirements","RESULTS","brief","commercial kits","effect of immunization","cutoff value","sensitivity","CONCLUSIONS","time"],"language":"en"},

Cypovirus of the family Reoviridae provides a good model system for studying the methylation reactions in dsRNA viruses. Here, we present the structure of a transcribing cypovirus to a resolution of ~ 3.8 \u00C5 by cryo-electron microscopy. The binding sites for both S-adenosyl-l-methionine and RNA in the two methyltransferases of the turret were identified. Structural analysis of the turret in complex with RNA revealed a pathway through which the RNA molecule reaches the active sites of the two methyltransferases before it is released into the cytoplasm. The pathway shows that RNA capping reactions occur in the active sites of different turret protein monomers, suggesting that RNA capping requires concerted efforts by at least three turret protein monomers.

The current paradigm for increasing the safety of the blood supply is the development and implementation of laboratory screening methods and restrictive donor criteria. When considering the large number of known pathogens and the fact that pathogens continue to emerge, it is clear that the utility of new tests and donor restrictions will continue to be a challenge when considering the cost of developing and implementing new screening assays, the loss of potential donors, and the risk of testing errors. Despite improving the safety of blood components, testing remains a reactive approach to blood safety. The contaminating organisms must be identified before sensitive tests can be developed. In contrast, pathogen inactivation is a proactive strategy designed to inactivate a pathogen before it enters the blood supply. Almost all pathogen inactivation technologies target nucleic acids, allowing for the inactivation of a variety of nucleic acid\u2013containing pathogens within plasma, platelets, or red blood cells thus providing the potential to reduce transfusion-transmitted diseases. However, widespread use of a pathogen inactivation technology can only be realized when proven safe and efficacious and not cost-prohibitive.","publish_time":"2005-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Allain, Jean Pierre; Bianco, Celso; Blajchman, Morris A.; Brecher, Mark E.; Busch, Michael; Leiby, David; Lin, Lily; Stramer, Susan","journal":"Transfusion Medicine Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/318f15fcdacc13512bc8e14b93b407a9ea4e021d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126528.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887796304000823; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887796304000823","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blood transfusion","blood safety","blood supply","safety of blood components","pathogen inactivation technology","pathogen inactivation technologies","red blood cells","dangerous pathogens","cost","large number of known pathogens","new screening assays","utility of new tests","Transfusion-related fatalities","transfusion-transmitted diseases","risk of testing errors","nucleic acids","donor restrictions","breakthrough infections","risk of infection","sensitive tests","loss of potential donors","restrictive donor criteria","variety of nucleic acid","implementation of laboratory screening methods","development","plasma","reactive approach","platelets","proactive strategy","fact","widespread use","contrast","contaminating organisms","challenge","current paradigm"],"language":"en"},

Since the 1980\u2019s, several canine caliciviruses (CaCV) isolates have been reported and are phylogenetically related to the vesiviruses with features distinct from both Vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) and Feline calicivirus (FCV) species in phylogeny, serology and cell culture specificities. Etiological studies of canine diseases in dogs used for military services and laboratory studies were conducted in 1963\u20131978 at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Multiple known and unknown viral pathogens including caliciviruses were recovered. METHODS: Four unidentified isolates were recovered in Walter Reed Canine Cells (WRCC) from respiratory, fecal and penile specimens. Physicochemical tests, electron microscopy, viral cultivation in human and animal cells, antibody neutralization assays, and recently the genome sequencing were used to characterize the isolates. Sera from these dogs and their cohorts were tested with the isolates to determine origin and prevalence of the infections. RESULTS: The viral isolates were small non-enveloped spherical RNA virions, 27 to 42 nm in diameter with cup-like structures, indicating they are caliciviruses. They propagated in WRCC and MDCK cells, not in either other canine cells or human and other animal cells. Each isolate is antigenically distinct and react with dog sera in respective cohorts. The genomes have nucleotide identities ranging from 70.3% to 90.7% and encode the non-structural polyprotein (1810 amino acids), major capsid protein (691 amino acids) and minor structural protein (134 amino acids). They belong to two different phylogenetic clades in Vesivirus genus with close relation with canine calicivirus (CaCV). CONCLUSIONS: These CaCV isolates have restricted cell tropism, antigenic diversity and genetic variation. Further investigation will shed light on antigenic relation to other vesiviruses, and its pathogenicity for dogs and potential infectivity to other animals. Together with the previously reported CaCV strains provides significant evidence to support the formation of a new CaCV species in the Vesivirus genus.

Then, cl\u20102 invades the ventricle and ventricular wall along the newly assembled ERfibs after infection, using them as a pathway from the meninges, the initial site of infection. In the lymph nodes and spleen, ERag is mainly produced by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), which play a key role in nursing the ERfibs to form a fibroblastic reticular network (FRN). The FRN functions as a conduit system to transfer antigens, cytokines or leukocytes in the lymphoid organs. In the brain parenchyma, astrocytes were found to produce the main components of mature ERfibs, such as collagen, laminin and ERag, which have been identified in the lymphoid organs. The producibility of these extracellular matrices (ECMs) by astrocytes was further confirmed by primary brain cultures, which disclosed the dissociation of laminin and ERag production, and the close association of ERag production with that of collagen, forming a fibrous structure. The pattern of ECM production in vitro indicated the process of forming mature ERfibs in the brain, that is, fibers made of collagen fibers and ERag are wrapped by laminin prepared as a sheet structure. In addition, the brain parenchymal cells that produce interferon \u03B2 after infection in spite of their residence away from the sites of viral invasion were surrounded by ERfibs, which were closely associated with astrocytic fibers. These findings indicate that astrocytes play a central role in forming the astrocytic reticular network (ARN) in the brain parenchyma, as FRCs do to form FRN in the lymphoid organs.","publish_time":"2017-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watanabe, Rihito; Kakizaki, Masatoshi","journal":"Neuropathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/008d5e2223086380041cb279f63723896814034c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168127.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28317173/; https://doi.org/10.1111/neup.12374","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FRN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["collagen fibers","assembled ERfibs","brain parenchymal cells","astrocytes","astrocytic fibers","lymphoid organs","close association of ERag production","primary brain cultures","main components of mature ERfibs","dissociation of laminin","positive fibers","fibroblastic reticular cells","fibroblastic reticular network","astrocytic reticular network","meninges","antigens","initial site of infection","early phase of infection","FRCs","FRN functions","ventricle","pattern of ECM production","central role","key role","sheet structure","fibrous structure","cytokines","interferon \u03B2","conduit system","rapid increase","ARN","TR7 antigen","expression levels","extracellular matrices","ECMs","residence","spite","ventricular wall","leukocytes","nursing","process","sites of viral invasion","neurovirulent murine coronavirus","producibility","lymph nodes","spleen","pathway","appearance","addition","findings"],"language":"en"},

During neurotropic coronavirus virus (JHMV) induced encephalomyelitis, MMP9 activity is restricted to neutrophils. Furthermore, myeloid cell depletion implicated MMP9 in facilitating leukocyte central nervous system (CNS) infiltration via loss of BBB integrity. The requirement of MMP9 in BBB disruption was thus assessed in JHMV infected MMP9 deficient (MMP9(\u2212/\u2212)) mice. Depletion of neutrophils reduced CNS accumulation of monocytes and T cells, albeit without affecting overall pathogenesis. By contrast, infected MMP9(\u2212/\u2212) mice revealed no differences in CNS leukocyte infiltration, composition or localization, consistent with BBB disruption similar to wild type (WT) mice. Unimpaired T cell mediated virus control supported an unexpectedly redundant role of MMP9 in promoting leukocyte access to the brain parenchyma. While MMP9 deficiency did not expand the overall limited pattern of MMP expression during JHMV infection, it coincided with MMP3 upregulation. MMP3 expression remained largely confined to astrocytes, similar to WT mice. These data demonstrate that neutrophil-derived MMP9 is not the sole mediator facilitating parenchymal leukocyte entry via BBB disruption during viral encephalomyelitis. Moreover, significantly enhanced MMP3 expression by astrocytes in infected MMP9(\u2212/\u2212) mice suggests an active role of resident cells in participating and potentially collaborating with infiltrating cells in regulating BBB permeability. Overall, these results highlight the complexity of targeting individual MMPs as a strategy to regulate inflammation.","publish_time":"2011-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savarin, Carine; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Rietsch, Anna M.; Butchi, Niranjan; Ransohoff, Richard M.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","journal":"Glia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270.json; document_parses/pdf_json/42fe0da21883fda9e35be10cebd2982e95daea9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3174277.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3174277?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21800363/; https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.21222","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BBB","CNS","MMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MMP9 correlates","MMP9 activity","MMP9 deficiency","requirement of MMP9","redundant role of MMP9","JHMV infected MMP9 deficient","neutrophil-derived MMP9","BBB disruption similar","BBB permeability","WT mice","myeloid cell depletion implicated MMP9","CNS leukocyte infiltration","loss of BBB integrity","enhanced MMP3 expression","leukocyte access","parenchymal leukocyte entry","JHMV infection","astrocytes","overall limited pattern of MMP expression","Depletion of neutrophils","Expression of matrix metalloproteinases","infiltrating cells","MMP3 upregulation","overall pathogenesis","facilitating leukocyte central nervous system","active role of resident cells","CNS accumulation of monocytes","Unimpaired T cell mediated virus control","viral encephalomyelitis","individual MMPs","brain parenchyma","blood brain barrier","neurotropic coronavirus virus","localization","composition","sole mediator","wild type","differences","complexity","strategy","data","neuroinflammatory diseases","results","inflammation","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes pathological lesions in the chicken oviduct. In the current study, mitochondrial counts were determined in three different segments of the oviduct during egg formation in laying chickens challenged with IBV T strain. Nuclear DNA encoded genes that are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, fission and function were studied in the shell gland of the oviduct undergoing virus multiplication. RESULTS: In the shell gland, the mitochondrial count was significantly lower (P \u003C 0.05) in the challenged group, compared with the control group. However, it did not vary in response to IBV challenge in the isthmus and magnum regions of the oviduct. The gene succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A, flavoprotein variant (SDHA) was down-regulated in the shell gland by IBV challenge (P \u003C 0.05), while other genes being studied did not show responses to the challenge (P \u003E 0.05). Differential expression of the genes was observed at different time-points of egg-shell formation. The expression levels of citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome C, somatic (CYC, S) and sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na(\u002B)-K(\u002B)ATPase) genes were significantly higher, while those of SDHA and dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) genes were significantly lower, at 15 h compared with 5 h following oviposition of the previous egg. The expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03B1) did not show significant change at different time-points. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that IBV T strain infection in laying hens reduced mitochondrial counts only in the shell gland region of the oviduct. The genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis or function may not show synchronised responses to that of mitochondria in the shell gland of chickens under T strain of IBV challenge.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Samiullah; Roberts, Juliet; Wu, Shu-Biao","journal":"BMC Mol Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79d2ee55b54d57041ab6d9a3ecac33bc98d11ff5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6446503.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041887/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12860-019-0190-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shell gland of chickens","egg-shell formation","T strain of IBV challenge","shell gland region","oviduct of laying hens","mitochondrial counts","mitochondrial biogenesis","Egg formation","chicken oviduct","IBV T strain infection","laying chickens","previous egg","different time-points","function","different segments","SDHA","h period","Differential expression","challenged group","expression levels of citrate synthase","virus multiplication","synchronised responses","control group","Infectious bronchitis virus","expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator","subunit","CS","cytochrome C","alpha","isthmus","place","pathological lesions","sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase","CYC","Drp1","significant change","gene succinate dehydrogenase complex","dynamin related protein","flavoprotein variant","magnum regions","PGC","oviposition","current study","BACKGROUND","fission","Nuclear DNA","ATPase","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to investigate the hospitalization incidence and clinical\u2010epidemiological characteristics of influenza B\u2010associated paediatric ARIs in central Vietnam. METHODS: We collected clinical\u2010epidemiological information and nasopharyngeal swabs from ARI children hospitalized at Khanh Hoa General Hospital, Nha Trang, Vietnam from February 2007 through June 2013. Nasopharyngeal samples were screened for 13 respiratory viruses using Multiplex\u2010PCRs. Influenza B\u2010confirmed cases were genotyped by Haemagglutinin gene sequencing. We analyzed the clinical\u2010epidemiological characteristics of influenza B Lineages (Victoria/Yamagata) and WHO Groups. RESULTS: In the pre\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 period, influenza B\u2010associated ARI hospitalization incidence among children under five was low, ranging between 14.7 and 80.7 per 100 000 population. The incidence increased to between 51.4 and 330 in the post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09. Influenza B ARI cases were slightly older with milder symptoms. Both Victoria and Yamagata lineages were detected before the A/H1N1pdm09 outbreak; however, Victoria lineage became predominant in 2010\u20102013 (84% Victoria vs 16% Yamagata). Victoria and Yamagata lineages did not differ in demographic and clinical characteristics. In Victoria lineage, Group1 ARI cases were clinically more severe compared to Group5, presenting a greater proportion of wheeze, tachypnea, and lower respiratory tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: The current results highlight the increased incidence of influenza B\u2010related ARI hospitalization among children in central Vietnam in the post\u2010A/H1N1pdm09 era.

Interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine also express ACE2 receptors. Role of the gut microbiota in influencing lung diseases has been well articulated. It is also known that respiratory virus infection causes perturbations in the gut microbiota. Diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota which can influence immunity. Gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and Covid-19 has been mainly fatal in elderly patients which again points to the role the gut microbiota may play in this disease. Improving gut microbiota profile by personalized nutrition and supplementation known to improve immunity can be one of the prophylactic ways by which the impact of this disease can be minimized in old people and immune-compromised patients.

In addition to known non-structural and structural proteins all coronaviruses have one or more accessory proteins whose functions are mostly unknown. Our study focuses on hCoV-NL63 open reading frame 3 (ORF 3) which is a highly conserved accessory protein among coronaviruses. RESULTS: In-silico analysis of the 225 amino acid sequence of hCoV-NL63 ORF 3 predicted a triple membrane-spanning protein. Expression in infected CaCo-2 and LLC-MK2 cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The protein was detected within the endoplasmatic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where coronavirus assembly and budding takes place. Subcellular localization studies using recombinant ORF 3 protein transfected in Huh-7 cells revealed occurrence in ERGIC, Golgi- and lysosomal compartments. By fluorescence microscopy of differently tagged envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins it was shown that ORF 3 protein colocalizes extensively with E and M within the ERGIC. Using N-terminally FLAG-tagged ORF 3 protein and an antiserum specific to the C-terminus we verified the proposed topology of an extracellular N-terminus and a cytosolic C-terminus. By in-vitro translation analysis and subsequent endoglycosidase H digestion we showed that ORF 3 protein is N-glycosylated at the N-terminus. Analysis of purified viral particles revealed that ORF 3 protein is incorporated into virions and is therefore an additional structural protein. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first extensive expression analysis of a group 1 hCoV-ORF 3 protein. We give evidence that ORF 3 protein is a structural N-glycosylated and virion-incorporated protein.","publish_time":"2010-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCller, Marcel A; van der Hoek, Lia; Voss, Daniel; Bader, Oliver; Lehmann, D\u00F6rte; Schulz, Axel R; Kallies, Stephan; Suliman, Tasnim; Fielding, Burtram C; Drosten, Christian; Niedrig, Matthias","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa8a9f4a432fa52294b1fa674b3ffbeadeff563f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2819038.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20078868/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","ERGIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NL63 ORF","hCoV-ORF","protein colocalizes","additional structural protein","recombinant ORF","conserved accessory protein","virion-incorporated protein","structural N","extracellular N-terminus","ERGIC","silico analysis","structural proteins","extensive expression analysis","accessory proteins","vitro translation analysis","Western blot analysis","cytosolic C-terminus","Human pathogenic coronavirus NL63","hCoV-NL63 open reading frame","coronavirus assembly","group","coronaviruses","study","amino acid sequence of hCoV","triple membrane","Golgi intermediate compartment","LLC-MK2 cells","subsequent endoglycosidase H digestion","endoplasmatic reticulum","immunofluorescence","proposed topology","antiserum specific","Subcellular localization studies","budding takes place","envelope","BACKGROUND","virions","viral particles","infected CaCo","respiratory tract infections","functions","lysosomal compartments","alpha","occurrence","nucleocapsid","FLAG","fluorescence microscopy","RESULTS","evidence","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Most episodes of acute diarrhea are self-limited, and investigations should be performed only if the results will influence management and outcome. After an adequate history and physical examination, the clinician should be able to classify the acute diarrheal illness, assess the severity, and determine whether investigations are needed. Most patients do not require specific therapy. Therapy should mainly be directed at preventing dehydration. Various home remedies frequently suffice in mild, self-limited diarrhea. However, in large-volume, dehydrating diarrhea, oral rehydration solutions should be used, as they are formulated to stimulate sodium and water absorption. Antidiarrheal agents can be useful in reducing the number of bowel movements and diminishing the magnitude of fluid loss. The most useful agents are opiate derivatives and bismuth subsalicylate.

For the 0.22\u03BCm module, the cake layer, the gel layer and the membrane contributed 6.3log, 3.1log and 1.7log, respectively to phage removal, confirming the importance of the cake/gel layer formed on the surface of membrane. The damage of the cake/gel layer resulted in the decrease of phage removal. As for the 0.1\u03BCm one, the membrane alone played a major role in phage removal. Inactivation by activated sludge and adsorption by cake/gel layer contributed about 3.6log to phage removal everyday so that there was no phage accumulation in bulk solution.

Moreover, it highlights the rationale and the reasons for each study: reducing the discharge of micropollutants in surface water, improving existing wastewater treatment technologies and reducing the risk of spread of pathogens causing endemic diseases and finally, it offers a critical analysis of the conclusions and suggestions of each study. The most investigated technologies are membrane bioreactors equipped with ultrafiltration membranes in the secondary step, ozonation followed by activated carbon filtration (in powder and in granules) in the polishing step. Interesting research projects deal with photo-Fenton processes acting as primary treatments to enhance biodegradation before biological treatment, and as a polishing step, thus further reducing micro-contaminant occurrence. Investment and operational costs are also presented and discussed for the different treatment technologies tested worldwide, in particular membrane bioreactors and various advanced oxidation processes. This study also discusses the need for further research to evaluate toxicity resulting from advanced oxidation processes as well as the need to develop an accurate feasibility study that encompasses technical, ecotoxicological and economic aspects to identify the best available treatment in the different situations from a global view point.","publish_time":"2015-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verlicchi, P.; Al Aukidy, M.; Zambello, E.","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7be513c6f54a7cc5d7ab75ae59b1caeeda569dfd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112026.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.02.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715001564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25698384/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969715001564","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different treatment technologies","biological treatment","existing wastewater treatment technologies","polishing step","efficacy of different treatment levels","best available treatment","secondary step","study overviews lessons","accurate feasibility study","dedicated treatment systems of hospital effluent","different situations","various advanced oxidation processes","hospital wastewater","investigated technologies","need","particular membrane bioreactors","photo-Fenton processes","primary treatments","Interesting research projects","experimental investigations","surface water","ultrafiltration membranes","economic aspects","wide spectrum of pharmaceutical compounds","ecotoxicological","ozonation","risk","toxicity","discharge of micropollutants","carbon filtration","global view point","conclusions","suggestions","granules","biodegradation","pathogens","critical analysis","conventional contaminants","powder","micro-contaminant occurrence","endemic diseases","peer reviewed papers","Investment","operational costs","rationale","reasons","years"],"language":"en"},

Conclusiones En nuestro estudio no encontramos diferencias en la incidencia de aneurismas coronarios en ni\u00F1os con y sin IMC o IPR, por lo que ante la sospecha de EK debe iniciarse siempre tratamiento, aunque se tenga infecci\u00F3n confirmada microbiol\u00F3gicamente. Abstract Introduction Kawasaki disease (KD) is a multisystem vasculitis associated with coronary artery abnormalities. Infections could be a trigger of the inflammation. The main aim of this study was to describe the presence of infections in children with KD, and to analyse the clinical characteristics and the presence of coronary abnormalities in these cases. Patients and methods A retrospective study was performed within the Kawasaki Diseases Network (KAWA-RACE (2011-2016). An analysis was performed that included patients with positive microbiological findings (PMF) during the acute phase, as well as those with a previous recent infection (PRI) during the 4 weeks preceding KD diagnosis. Results The study included total of 621 children with KD, with PMF being found in 101 (16.3%) patients, and a PRI in 107 (17.2%). Significantly less echocardiographic abnormalities were found in the in the group with a PRI, when compared to those without a PRI (23 vs. 35%, P =.01) and also a lower proportion of overall coronary artery lesions (16 vs. 25%, P =.054). No significant differences were found in the proportion of aneurysms in either of these groups (PRI or PMF) when compared to those without infection. Conclusions In the present study, no differences were found in the incidence of coronary aneurysms in either of the groups, with or without PRI or PMF. Therefore, if KD is suspected, appropriate treatment should be started despite having a confirmed infection.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fern\u00E1ndez-Cooke, Elisa; Barrios Tasc\u00F3n, Ana; Ant\u00F3n-L\u00F3pez, Jordi; Grasa Lozano, Carlos Daniel; S\u00E1nchez-Manubens, Judith; Calvo, Cristina","journal":"Anales de Pediatr\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1fa38567b670b9896eea1af116231b5a4c9913d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105073.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1695403318303084; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1695403318303084","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pacientes","Resultados"],"organizations":["IMC","Kawasaki","Kawasaki Diseases Network","PMF","KD","PRI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infecciones en los ni\u00F1os","lesiones en","los pacientes incluidos en","encontramos diferencias en","una IPR","aneurismas en ninguno","aneurismas coronarios en ni\u00F1os","se detectaron diferencias en","los cuales","tuvieron una IMC y","los ni\u00F1os sin infecci\u00F3n previa","y sin IMC o IPR","los pacientes sin infecciones asociadas","PMF","Conclusiones En nuestro estudio","alteraciones coronarias en estos casos","IPR respecto","Encontramos una significativa menor afectaci\u00F3n ecocardiogr\u00E1fica en","EK y analizar","los que presentaron antecedente","los pacientes que tuvieron una identificaci\u00F3n microbiol\u00F3gica confirmada","coronary artery abnormalities","presence of coronary abnormalities","Patients","caracter\u00EDsticas cl\u00EDnicas y","Pacientes y m\u00E9todos An\u00E1lisis retrospectivo","Sin embargo","retrospective study","present study","Las infecciones podr\u00EDan ser","incidence of coronary aneurysms","presencia","aunque se tenga infecci\u00F3n confirmada microbiol\u00F3gicamente","es una vasculitis multisist\u00E9mica asociada","infecci\u00F3n previa reciente","menor proporci\u00F3n","Se estudi\u00F3 tanto","alteraciones coronarias globales","arterias coronarias","Resultados Se incluy\u00F3","weeks preceding KD diagnosis","children","proportion of aneurysms","presence of infections","groups","echocardiographic abnormalities","total","confirmed infection","lower proportion of overall coronary artery lesions","Kawasaki Diseases Network","previous recent infection","multisystem vasculitis","red KAWA-RACE entre","Abstract Introduction Kawasaki disease","significant differences","EK debe iniciarse siempre tratamiento","Nuestro objetivo fue describir","resto","periodo agudo como","incidencia","grupos","sospecha","enfermedad","desencadenante","positive microbiological findings","clinical characteristics","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n","inflamaci\u00F3n","methods","cases","acute phase","semanas anteriores","trigger","main aim","Conclusions","appropriate treatment","inflammation","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We summarize what is known about the epidemiology, virology, phylogeny and emergence of MERS-CoV to inform public health policies. Results: The median age of patients (n=161) was 50 years (range 14 months to 94 years), 64.5% were male and 63.4% experienced severe respiratory disease. 76.0% of patients were reported to have \u22651 underlying medical condition and fatal cases, compared to recovered or asymptomatic cases were more likely to have an underlying condition (86.8% vs. 42.4%, p\u003C0.001). Analysis of genetic sequence data suggests multiple independent introductions into human populations and modelled estimates using epidemiologic and genetic data suggest R0 is \u003C1, though the upper range of estimates may exceed 1. Index/sporadic cases (cases with no epidemiologic-link to other cases) were more likely to be older (median 59.0 years vs. 43.0 years, p\u003C0.001) compared to secondary cases, although these proportions have declined over time. 80.9% vs. 67.2% of index/sporadic and secondary cases, respectively, reported \u22651 underlying condition.

Nearly all symptomatic patients presented with respiratory symptoms and 1/3 of patients also had gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusions: Sustained human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has not been observed. Outbreaks have been extinguished without overly aggressive isolation and quarantine suggesting that transmission of virus may be stopped with implementation of appropriate infection control measures.","publish_time":"2013-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"PLoS Curr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3828229.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.outbreaks.0bf719e352e7478f8ad85fa30127ddb8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24270606/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic cases","sporadic cases","secondary cases","fatal cases","years","probable MERS-CoV cases","underlying condition","human transmission of MERS","respiratory symptoms","symptomatic patients","median age of patients","underlying medical condition","human populations","genetic data","Sustained human","emergence of MERS","Index","experienced severe respiratory disease","upper range of estimates","severe pneumonia","acute respiratory distress syndrome","modelled estimates","Analysis of genetic sequence data","epidemiologic-link","transmission of virus","gastrointestinal symptoms","multiple independent introductions","multi-organ failure","phylogeny","Clinical presentation ranges","implementation of appropriate infection control measures","quarantine","virology","public health policies","aggressive isolation","epidemiology","Results","R0","proportions","months","countries","laboratory","Conclusions","time","Outbreaks","Background","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The ability of MERS-CoV to evade the host innate antiviral response may contribute to its severe pathogenesis. Many MERS-CoV-encoded proteins were identified to have interferon (IFN)-antagonizing properties, which correlates well with the reduced IFN levels observed in infected patients and ex vivo models. In this study, we fully characterized the IFN-antagonizing property of the MERS-CoV M protein. Expression of MERS-CoV M protein suppressed type I IFN expression in response to Sendai virus infection or poly(I:C) induction. This suppressive effect was found to be specific for the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) but not nuclear factor-\u03BAB. MERS-CoV M protein interacted with TRAF3 and disrupted TRAF3\u2013TBK1 association leading to reduced IRF3 activation. M proteins from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have three highly similar conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains and a C-terminal region. Using chimeric and truncation mutants, the N-terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS-CoV M protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitory effect on IFN expression, whereas the C-terminal domain was unable to induce this suppression. Collectively, our findings suggest a common and conserved mechanism through which highly pathogenic MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV harness their M proteins to suppress type I IFN expression at the level of TBK1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 resulting in evasion of the host innate antiviral response.","publish_time":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lui, Pak-Yin; Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Fung, Cheuk-Lai; Siu, Kam-Leung; Yeung, Man-Lung; Yuen, Kit-San; Chan, Chi-Ping; Woo, Patrick Chiu-Yat; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Jin, Dong-Yan","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa973f2833829b97ebdfd6ce2ac6a29b9100db3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4855074.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.33; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27094905/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["pathogenic MERS-CoV","Expression of MERS","SARS-CoV","IFN expression","ability of MERS","reduced IFN levels","IFN-antagonizing property","activation of IFN regulatory factor","activation of IRF3","C-terminal domain","reduced IRF3 activation","C-terminal region","antiviral response","protein suppressed type","similar conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains","host","encoded proteins","TBK1 association","level of TBK1","disrupted TRAF3","conserved mechanism","inhibitory effect","antagonizing properties","suppressive effect","Sendai virus infection","nuclear factor-\u03BAB","infected patients","poly","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","dependent phosphorylation","interferon","evasion","global threat","truncation mutants","emergence","Saudi Arabia","hundreds of lives","models","findings","severe pathogenesis","suppression","induction","study"],"language":"en"},

An analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov offers an opportunity to define the clinical research landscape; here we analyze 10 years of infectious disease (ID) clinical trial research. METHODS: Beginning with 166 415 interventional trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from 2007\u20132017, ID trials were selected by study conditions and interventions. Relevance to ID was confirmed through manual review, resulting in 13 707 ID trials and 152 708 non-ID trials. RESULTS: ID-related trials represented 6.9%\u20139.9% of all trials with no significant trend over time. ID trials tended to be more focused on treatment and prevention, with a focus on testing drugs, biologics, and vaccines. ID trials tended to be large, randomized, and nonblinded with a greater degree of international enrollment. Industry was the primary funding source for 45.2% of ID trials. Compared with the global burden of disease, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS and hepatitis C trials were overrepresented, and lower respiratory tract infection trials were underrepresented. Hepatitis C trials fluctuated, keeping with a wave of new drug development. Influenza vaccine trials peaked during the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the most comprehensive characterization of ID clinical trials over the past decade. These results help define how clinical research aligns with clinical need. Temporal trends reflect changes in disease epidemiology and the impact of scientific discovery and market forces. Periodic review of ID clinical trials can help identify gaps and serve as a mechanism to realign resources.","publish_time":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jaffe, Ian S; Chiswell, Karen; Tsalik, Ephraim L","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7aee99640edf75791f77fd9ab46534c27efdaae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6598302.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276007/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofz189","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ClinicalTrials.gov","ID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-ID trials","ID-related trials","Periodic review of ID clinical trials","comprehensive characterization of ID clinical trials","hepatitis C trials","Influenza vaccine trials","Registration of interventional trials of Food","lower respiratory tract infection trials","clinical need","clinical trial research","clinical research landscape","disease epidemiology","Drug Administration","regulated drug","RESULTS","global burden of disease","years of infectious disease","wave of new drug development","manual review","study conditions","H1N1 swine influenza outbreak","AIDS","human immunodeficiency virus","biological products","impact of scientific discovery","devices","focus","legal requirement","changes","testing drugs","biologics","prevention","market forces","Temporal trends","primary funding source","opportunity","gaps","past decade","vast majority","greater degree of international enrollment","vaccines","Industry","treatment","significant trend","time","BACKGROUND","mechanism","interventions","Relevance","METHODS","resources","analysis of","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The second was to determine the optimum adjuvant formulation of the inactivated PEDV vaccine that induces protection against viral challenge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To generate high titers of infectious PEDV, the QIAP1401 isolate was passaged in Vero cells. The experimental vaccines were prepared from a binary ethyleneimine-inactivated QIAP1401 strain passaged sequentially 70 times (QIAP1401-p70), formulated with four commercial adjuvants, and administered twice intramuscularly to growing pigs. Challenge studies using a virulent homologous strain of PEDV QIAP1401-p11, which was passaged 11 times after isolation, were performed to assess protection against disease progression and viral shedding during the 15-day observation period. The vaccine-induced antibody responses were measured in serum samples collected at predetermined time points by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and virus neutralization test. RESULTS: The QIAP1401-p70 strain had 42 amino acid (aa) mutations, including a 25 aa deletion, and was selected as the inactivated PEDV vaccine candidate. Although none of the pigs that received the experimental vaccines were completely protected against subsequent viral challenge, they exhibited a significantly higher immune response than did non-vaccinated control pigs. Among the vaccine groups, the highest antibody responses were observed in the pigs that received an oil-based multiphasic water/oil/water (W/O/W) emulsion adjuvanted vaccine, which delayed the onset of clinical symptoms and viral shedding.

The influence of various parameters on the performance of the treatment process has been considered, namely the UV irradiation light intensity, the initial concentrations of iopromide and peroxydisulfate, and the initial solution pH. Iopromide degradation increased with UV light intensity and peroxydisulfate concentration, but decreased with initial pH. Under specific conditions complete removal of iopromide was achieved within 30min, and near-complete mineralisation (loss of solution TOC) within 80min. Degradation was believed to be caused by a combination of direct photolysis, sulphate radical attack, and, to a minor degree, direct oxidation by peroxydisulfate. Approximate values for the reaction rate constants have been determined and found to be equal to 1\u20132\u00D7104 M\u22121 s\u22121 for sulfate radicals, and 1\u20132M\u22122 s\u22121 for S2O8 2\u2212. Overall compound degradation was observed to follow first-order kinetics where the rate constant decreased with initial solution pH. During the reaction, the solution pH decreased as a consequence of sulfate radical scavenging.","publish_time":"2010-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Ting W.; Graham, Nigel J.D.; Chu, Wei","journal":"Journal of Hazardous Materials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a676dc0d0745858da098764a508c96d69694adc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116998.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20561746/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389410006266; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.05.043; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389410006266","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["initial pH","initial solution pH","Iopromide degradation","initial concentrations of iopromide","aqueous degradation of iopromide","peroxydisulfate concentration","potassium peroxydisulfate","Overall compound degradation","UV light intensity","UV irradiation light intensity","loss of solution TOC","specific conditions complete removal of iopromide","combination of UV254 irradiation","combination of direct photolysis","reaction rate constants","complete mineralisation","direct oxidation","radical attack","consequence of sulfate radical scavenging","sulfate radicals","iodinated X-ray contrast media","ICM","performance","K2S2O8","minor degree","Approximate values","influence of various parameters","order kinetics","treatment process","laboratory scale experiments"],"language":"en"},

The orbivirus group consists of a large number of members, some of which are transmitted by vectors and, therefore, belong to the heterogenic arboviruses. Of the orbiviruses, the Colorado tick fever virus is the only one known to cause disease in man. As indicated by its name, the vector is a tick and the virus produces a febrile illness with myalgia. Arboviruses, that is, viruses borne by arthropod vectors and multiplying both in the arthropod and in the animal on which the arthropod is parasitic, show markedly variable morphological and biochemical characteristics. Coronavirus-like particles have been observed in fecal specimens of patients with gastroenteritis symptoms in India, Australia, Gambia, West Germany, and other countries.","publish_time":"1983-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Espmark, \u00C5ke; Grandien, Monica","journal":"Textbook of Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8e0efa426cc7ea8fe80188564daaa724b4c3f0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151969.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780407002531500384; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780407002531500384","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Colorado","India","Australia"],"keyphrases":["arthropod vectors","Colorado tick fever virus","biochemical characteristics","orbivirus group","reovirus family","heterogenic arboviruses","gastroenteritis symptoms","Australia","India","fecal specimens of patients","Gambia","West Germany","chapter","orbiviruses","groups","febrile illness","large number of members","reoviruses","insects","plants","particles","infections","Publisher Summary","myalgia","rotavirus","countries","animals","Coronavirus","disease"],"language":"en"},

The reported number of the active tuberculosis cases is about one million each year.

In this work, based on the reported data and the observed morbidity characteristics, we propose a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model with age groupings, involving three categories: children, the middle-aged, and senior to investigate the role of age on the transmission of tuberculosis in Mainland China from 2005 to 2016. Then, we evaluated the parameters by the Least Square method and simulated the model and it had good alignment with the reported infected TB data in Mainland China.

The contract service aimed to convert village doctors, who had privately practiced for decades, into general practitioners under the government management, and better control the rampant chronic diseases. This study made a rare attempt to assess the effectiveness of public health services delivered under the contract service policy, explore the influencing mechanism and draw the implications for the policy extension in the future. METHODS: Three pilot counties and a non-pilot one with heterogeneity in economic and health development from east to west of China were selected by a purposive sampling method. The case study methods by document collection, non-participant observation and interviews (including key informant interview and focus group interview) with 84 health providers and 20 demanders in multiple level were applied in this study. A thematic approach was used to compare diverse outcomes and analyze mechanism in the complex adaptive systems framework. RESULTS: Without sufficient incentives, the public health services were not conducted effectively, regardless of the implementation of the contract policy. To appropriately increase the funding for public health by local finance and properly allocate subsidy to village doctors was one of the most effective approaches to stimulate health providers and demanders\u2019 positivity and promote the policy implementation. County health bureaus acted as the most crucial agents among the complex public health systems. Their mental models influenced by the compound and various environments around them led to the diverse outcomes. If they could provide extra incentives and make the contexts of the systems ripe enough for change, the health providers and demanders would be receptive to the transition of the policy. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative fund raising measures could be taken by relatively developed counties of China to conduct public health services. Policymakers could take systems thinking as a useful tool to design plans and predict the unintended outcomes during the process of public health reforms.","publish_time":"2015-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Huixuan; Zhang, Shengfa; Zhang, Weijun; Wang, Fugang; Zhong, You; Gu, Linni; Qu, Zhiyong; Tian, Donghua","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34483f6b88d4999066d631b65cdf0f256d305b6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4349463.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25880965/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-1540-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["health providers","health development","complex public health systems","effectiveness of public health services","process of public health reforms","County health bureaus","contract policy","contract service policy","policy implementation","policy extension","pilot counties","systems ripe","diverse outcomes","non-pilot","developed counties of China","complex adaptive systems framework","funding","case study methods","unintended outcomes","village doctors","group interview","government management","influencing mechanism","west of China","Chinese government","sufficient incentives","extra incentives","non-participant observation","key informant interview","document collection","interviews","better control","crucial agents","local finance","demanders\u2019 positivity","east","heterogeneity","change","rampant chronic diseases","multiple level","compound","measures","general practitioners","plans","subsidy","contexts","implications","effective approaches","rural areas","rare attempt","CONCLUSIONS","innovative fund","various environments","family medicine","useful tool","transition","purposive sampling method","mental models","thematic approach","counterpart","decades","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","future","Policymakers"],"language":"en"},

In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Vitamin C, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitamin C in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hern\u00E1ndez, A.; Papadakos, P.J.; Torres, A.; Gonz\u00E1lez, D.A.; Vives, M.; Ferrando, C.; Baeza, J.","journal":"Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156242.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2020.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303365/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Vitamin"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["potential effective therapy","potential benefits","potential effect of vitamin C","treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection","simple adjuvant therapies","relevant therapy","beneficial effects","exhaustive review","acute respiratory syndrome","effective antiviral drug","lack of ventilators","lung injury","key role","countries","intensive care beds","lungs","specific vaccine","SARS-CoV","inflammation","health system","potent antioxidant","low cost","COVID","Wuhan","document","necessaries","ozone","therapeutic arsenal","China","clinical trials","collapse","patients","world","pandemic","intubation","years","effectiveness","multiples studies","goal","Pneumonia"],"language":"en"},

We utilize here systemic cytokine and antibody levels in evaluating differences in early immune response in both mild and severe patients infected with nvH1N1. METHODS: We profiled 29 cytokines and chemokines and evaluated the haemagglutination inhibition activity as quantitative and qualitative measurements of host immune responses in serum obtained during the first five days after symptoms onset, in two cohorts of nvH1N1 infected patients. Severe patients required hospitalization (n = 20), due to respiratory insufficiency (10 of them were admitted to the intensive care unit), while mild patients had exclusively flu-like symptoms (n = 15). A group of healthy donors was included as control (n = 15). Differences in levels of mediators between groups were assessed by using the non parametric U-Mann Whitney test. Association between variables was determined by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient. Viral load was performed in serum by using real-time PCR targeting the neuraminidase gene. RESULTS: Increased levels of innate-immunity mediators (IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03B2), and the absence of anti-nvH1N1 antibodies, characterized the early response to nvH1N1 infection in both hospitalized and mild patients. High systemic levels of type-II interferon (IFN-\u03B3) and also of a group of mediators involved in the development of T-helper 17 (IL-8, IL-9, IL-17, IL-6) and T-helper 1 (TNF-\u03B1, IL-15, IL-12p70) responses were exclusively found in hospitalized patients. IL-15, IL-12p70, IL-6 constituted a hallmark of critical illness in our study. A significant inverse association was found between IL-6, IL-8 and PaO2 in critical patients. CONCLUSIONS: While infection with the nvH1N1 induces a typical innate response in both mild and severe patients, severe disease with respiratory involvement is characterized by early secretion of Th17 and Th1 cytokines usually associated with cell mediated immunity but also commonly linked to the pathogenesis of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. The exact role of Th1 and Th17 mediators in the evolution of nvH1N1 mild and severe disease merits further investigation as to the detrimental or beneficial role these cytokines play in severe illness.","publish_time":"2009-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F; Ortiz de Lejarazu, Raul; Pumarola, Tomas; Rello, Jordi; Almansa, Raquel; Ram\u00EDrez, Paula; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Varillas, David; Gallegos, Maria C; Ser\u00F3n, Carlos; Micheloud, Dariela; Gomez, Jose Manuel; Tenorio-Abreu, Alberto; Ramos, Mar\u00EDa J; Molina, M Lourdes; Huidobro, Samantha; Sanchez, Elia; Gord\u00F3n, M\u00F3nica; Fern\u00E1ndez, Victoria; del Castillo, Alberto; Marcos, Ma \u00C1ngeles; Villanueva, Beatriz; L\u00F3pez, Carlos Javier; Rodr\u00EDguez-Dom\u00EDnguez, Mario; Galan, Juan-Carlos; Cant\u00F3n, Rafael; Lietor, Aurora; Rojo, Silvia; Eiros, Jose M; Hinojosa, Carmen; Gonzalez, Isabel; Torner, Nuria; Banner, David; Leon, Alberto; Cuesta, Pablo; Rowe, Thomas; Kelvin, David J","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95d6b47d51b17a1f41ab4df0ed64086ebc11e589.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2811892.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20003352/; https://doi.org/10.1186/cc8208","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe patients","mild patients","IL-12p70","nvH1N1 infection","critical patients","hospitalized patients","cohorts of nvH1N1 infected patients","evolution of nvH1N1 mild","levels of mediators","severe illness","early response","early immune response","severe disease merits","Th17 mediators","immunity mediators","group of mediators","Human host immune response","Th1 cytokines","antibody levels","absence of anti-nvH1N1 antibodies","typical innate response","Increased levels of innate","early secretion of Th17","serum","differences","High systemic levels of type","T-helper","qualitative measurements of host immune responses","exact role of Th1","hallmark of critical illness","beneficial role","respiratory involvement","systemic cytokine","development of T","symptoms onset","respiratory insufficiency","cell mediated immunity","group of healthy donors","significant inverse association","haemagglutination inhibition activity","new variant","investigation","H1N1 pandemic influenza virus","interferon","parametric U-Mann Whitney test","real-time PCR","chemokines","INTRODUCTION","TNF-\u03B1","intensive care unit","pathogenesis of autoimmune","inflammatory diseases","neuraminidase gene","IFN-\u03B3","control","MCP","study","days","RESULTS","groups","PaO2","hospitalization","Spearman correlation coefficient","MIP","variables","Viral load","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

One-hundred female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were divided by weight into two groups. One group was exposed to constant light (LL) from 26 days of age, and the second group was exposed to 8 h light and 16 h dark per day (LD). Both groups received an 8 mg dose of a chemical carcinogen, dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) at 52 days of age. At 13 weeks post-DMBA, there were significantly fewer mammary tumors in the LL group compared with the LD group. Constant light was clearly demonstrated to have a profound effect on mammary tissue development. Although virgin, the majority of the LL rats (29/50) had gross evidence of lactation at 141 days of age. None of the LD rats (0/50) showed evidence of milk production. These results suggest that constant light not only substantially accelerated mammary gland development, but pushed development of the tissue past the stage normally observed in virgin animals (to the lactation stage).","publish_time":"2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anderson, L.

Conversely, when Canada has primarily used economic self-interest to define its global role, the country\u0027s perceived leadership in global health has diminished. Current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u0027s Liberal federal government has signalled a return to progressive values, driven by appreciation for diversity, equality, and Canada\u0027s responsibility to be a good global citizen. However, poor coordination of efforts, limited funding, and the unaddressed legacy of Canada\u0027s colonisation of Indigenous peoples weaken the potential for Canadians to make meaningful contributions to improvement of global health equity. Amid increased nationalism and uncertainty towards multilateral commitments by some major powers in the world, the Canadian federal government has a clear opportunity to convert its commitments to equity and global citizenship into stronger leadership on the global stage.

Modeling of the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein and its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 predicted comparable interaction energies in common marmosets and humans. The suitability of the marmoset as a MERS-CoV model was tested by inoculation via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes. Most of the marmosets developed a progressive severe pneumonia leading to euthanasia of some animals. Extensive lesions were evident in the lungs of all animals necropsied at different time points post inoculation. Some animals were also viremic; high viral loads were detected in the lungs of all infected animals, and total RNAseq demonstrated the induction of immune and inflammatory pathways.

We sought to determine the cytokines that reduce airflow, and the influence of respiratory viral infections on these relationships. METHODS: Children underwent home collections of nasal lavage during scheduled surveillance periods and self-reported respiratory illnesses. We studied 53 children for one year, analyzing 392 surveillance samples and 203 samples from 85 respiratory illnesses. Generalized estimated equations were used to evaluate associations between nasal lavage biomarkers (7 mRNAs, 10 proteins), lung function and viral infection. RESULTS: As anticipated, viral infection was associated with increased cytokines and reduced FVC and FEV(1). However, we found frequent and strong interactions between biomarkers and virus on lung function. For example, in the absence of viral infection, CXCL10 mRNA, MDA5 mRNA, CXCL10, IL-4, IL-13, CCL4, CCL5, CCL20 and CCL24 were negatively associated with FVC. In contrast, during infection, the opposite relationship was frequently found, with IL-4, IL-13, CCL5, CCL20 and CCL24 levels associated with less severe reductions in both FVC and FEV(1). CONCLUSIONS: In asthmatic children, airflow obstruction is driven by specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the absence of viral infection, higher cytokine levels are associated with decreasing lung function. However, with infection, there is a reversal in this relationship, with cytokine abundance associated with reduced lung function decline. While nasal samples may not reflect lower airway responses, these data suggest that some aspects of the inflammatory response may be protective against viral infection. This study may have ramifications for the treatment of viral-induced asthma exacerbations.

We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. METHODS: We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation. FINDINGS: Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17\u00B78 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16\u00B79\u201319\u00B72) and to hospital discharge to be 24\u00B77 days (22\u00B79\u201328\u00B71). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3\u00B767% (95% CrI 3\u00B756\u20133\u00B780). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1\u00B738% (1\u00B723\u20131\u00B753), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0\u00B732% [0\u00B727\u20130\u00B738] in those aged \u003C60 years vs 6\u00B74% [5\u00B77\u20137\u00B72] in those aged \u226560 years), up to 13\u00B74% (11\u00B72\u201315\u00B79) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1\u00B74% [0\u00B74\u20133\u00B75] in those aged \u003C60 years [n=360] and 4\u00B75% [1\u00B78\u201311\u00B71] in those aged \u226560 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0\u00B766% (0\u00B739\u20131\u00B733), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18\u00B74% (11\u00B70\u20137\u00B76) in those aged 80 years or older. INTERPRETATION: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.

The mechanism of action of many vaccines in common use remains incompletely understood. Understanding how such vaccines protect is an ongoing subject of study using increasingly sophisticated immunological tools, such as B cell and T cell repertoire and transcriptome analysis. Such tools are also being applied to the design of vaccines against those viral targets that have evaded vaccine-mediated protection thus far. As basic immunological science intersects with the practicalities of assuring vaccine safety, tolerability, efficacy, and consistency in the clinic, the practical utility of more sophisticated immunological measures for vaccine development may be determined by whether they can be reduced to simply executed, highly standardized, reproducible assays with outcomes that have clear interpretations for vaccine development and use. Basic immunology, empirical vaccine testing, and regulatory science are all necessary contributors to developing the next generation of vaccines, including vaccines effective against the pathogens for which vaccines are not currently available.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greenberg, Harry B.; Dormitzer, Philip R.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b533e6c2f49910960a6de8f0c5a892fbc73823f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152391.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123742797140160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742797140160","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine development","generation of vaccines","vaccines effective","design of vaccines","empirical vaccine testing","basic immunological science","sophisticated immunological tools","vaccine-mediated protection","sophisticated immunological measures","practicalities of assuring vaccine safety","result of empirical development","common use","B cell","regulatory science","Basic immunology","T cell repertoire","clear interpretations","efficacy","outcomes","tolerability","practical utility","reproducible assays","ongoing subject of study","transcriptome analysis","viral targets","clinic","consistency","necessary contributors","mechanism of action","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Viruses are a major cause of recreationally-associated waterborne diseases linked to pools, lakes, ponds, thermal pools/spas, rivers, and hot springs. They can make their way into waters through the accidental release of fecal matter, body fluids (saliva, mucus), or skin flakes by symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers.

Special attention is paid to outbreak investigations (source of the outbreak, pathways of transmission, chlorination/disinfection). Epidemiological studies on incidents of viral contamination of swimming pools under non-epidemic conditions are also reviewed.","publish_time":"2019-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonadonna, Lucia; La Rosa, Giuseppina","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25b2a50598fe741c4092ca239bacca5e72e79972.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6352248.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634384/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16020166","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral outbreaks","incidents of viral contamination of swimming pools","thermal pools","viruses","Epidemiological studies","availability of improved viral detection methodologies","updated overview of epidemiological data","health of swimming pool bathers","accidental release of fecal matter","body fluids","saliva","spas","skin flakes","mucus","rivers","non-epidemic conditions","ponds","pathways of transmission","waterborne diseases","project motivated","asymptomatic carriers","things","waters","investigations","bacteria","chlorination","major cause","disinfection","hot springs","Infectious agents","protozoa"],"language":"en"},

Existing bioethical frameworks are often not well suited to address the problems of public health. Methods The Nuffield Council on Bioethics set up an expert working party to examine the ethical issues surrounding public health in January 2006. Following evidence gathering and a public consultation exercise, the Council published its conclusions and recommendations in the report \u2018Public health: ethical issues\u2019 in November 2007. Results A spectrum of views exists on the relationship between the state\u0027s authority and the individual. The Council set out a proposal to capture the best of the libertarian and paternalistic approaches, in what it calls the \u2018stewardship model\u2019. This model suggests guiding principles for making decisions about public health policies, and highlights some key principles including Mill\u0027s harm principle, caring for the vulnerable, autonomy and consent. An \u2018intervention ladder\u2019 is also proposed, which provides a way of thinking about the acceptability of different public health measures. The report then applies these principles to a number of case studies: infectious diseases, obesity, alcohol and tobacco, and fluoridation of water supplies. Conclusions The idea of a \u2018nanny state\u2019 is often rejected, but the state has a duty to look after the health of everyone, and sometimes that means guiding or restricting people\u0027s choices. On the other hand, the state must consider a number of principles when designing public health programmes, and justification is required if any of these principles are to be infringed.","publish_time":"2009-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calman, K.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4712d8fed772e1f91fd429f63020724371ed3aa9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118790.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350608003168; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350608003168; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2008.10.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19135693/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Council","Council"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health policies","public health programmes","problems of public health","acceptability of different public health measures","number of principles","guiding principles","public consultation exercise","key principles","report","Nuffield Council","conclusions","nanny state","ethical issues\u2019","stewardship model","number of case studies","infectious diseases","tobacco","obesity","decisions","alcohol","Bioethics","recommendations","Mill\u0027s harm principle","SUMMARY Background","personal freedom","relationship","best","party","expert","fluoridation of water supplies","state\u0027s authority","libertarian","paternalistic approaches","way of thinking","Methods","idea","evidence","justification","Existing bioethical frameworks","type of measure","policy makers","spectrum of views","individual","autonomy","consent","proposal","duty","intervention ladder","people\u0027s choices","hand"],"language":"en"},

Because of the relative infrequency of this disease, the patterns of metastasis in MCC are understudied. METHODS: Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (8th edition) stage I\u2013IV MCC treated at our institution were identified (1/1/2008\u20132/28/2018). The first site of metastasis was classified as regional [regional lymph node (LN) basin, in-transit] or distant. Distant metastasis-free (DMFS) and MCC-specific (MSS) survival were estimated. RESULTS: Of 133 patients, 64 (48%) had stage I, 13 (10%) stage II, 48 (36%) stage III, and 8 (6%) stage IV disease at presentation. The median follow-up time in patients who remained alive was 36 (interquartile range 20\u201366) months. Regional or distant metastases developed in 78 (59%) patients. The first site was regional in 87%, including 73% with isolated LN involvement, and distant in 13%. Thirty-seven (28%) patients eventually developed distant disease, which most commonly involved the abdominal viscera (51%) and distant LNs (46%) first. The lung (0%) and brain (3%) were rarely the first distant sites. Stage III MCC at presentation was significantly associated with worse DMFS (hazard ratio 4.87, P = 0.001) and stage IV disease with worse MSS (hazard ratio 6.30, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Regional LN metastasis is the most common first metastatic event in MCC, confirming the importance of nodal evaluation. Distant disease spread appears to have a predilection for certain sites. Understanding these patterns could help to guide surveillance strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Yun; Azari, Feredun S.; Tang, Rebecca; Shannon, Adrienne B.; Miura, John T.; Fraker, Douglas L.; Karakousis, Giorgos C.","journal":"Ann Surg Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/229ecaf592ed2e5fd8119cefa70cb9e5029ab4fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7220648.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405979/; https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08587-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Merkel"],"organizations":["American Joint Committee","MCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distant disease","stage","distant sites","distant spread","Patients","distant metastases","distant LNs","Distant metastasis-free","Regional LN metastasis","MCC-specific","patterns of metastasis","site of metastasis","regional lymph node","worse DMFS","hazard ratio","worse MSS","presentation","isolated LN involvement","certain sites","Cancer","propensity","American Joint Committee","basin","cutaneous neuroendocrine malignancy","edition","Merkel cell carcinoma","METHODS","BACKGROUND","metastatic event","median follow-up time","interquartile range","importance of nodal evaluation","predilection","survival","transit","CONCLUSIONS","relative infrequency","months","surveillance strategies","abdominal viscera","lung","brain","RESULTS","institution"],"language":"en"},

Africa is the likely home to the ancestors of taxa residing within the Genus Lyssavirus, Family Rhabdoviridae. Diverse lyssaviruses are envisioned as co-evolving with bats, as the ultimate reservoirs, over seemingly millions of years. In terms of relative distribution, overt abundance, and resulting progeny, rabies virus is the most successful lyssavirus species today, but for unknown reasons. All mammals are believed to be susceptible to rabies virus infection. Besides reservoirs among the Chiroptera, meso-carnivores also serve as major historical hosts and are represented among the canids, raccoons, skunks, mongooses, and ferret badgers. Perpetuating as a disease of nature with the mammalian central nervous system as niche, host breadth alone precludes any candidacy for true eradication. Despite having the highest case fatality of any infectious disease and a burden in excess of or comparative to other major zoonoses, rabies remains neglected. Once illness appears, no treatment is proven to prevent death. Paradoxically, vaccines were developed more than a century ago, but the clear majority of human cases are unvaccinated. Tens of millions of people are exposed to suspect rabid animals and tens of thousands succumb annually, primarily children in developing countries, where canine rabies is enzootic. Rather than culling animal populations, one of the most cost-effective strategies to curbing human fatalities is the mass vaccination of dogs. Building on considerable progress to date, several complementary actions are needed in the near future, including a more harmonized approach to viral taxonomy, enhanced de-centralized laboratory-based surveillance, focal pathogen discovery and characterization, applied pathobiological research for therapeutics, improved estimates of canine populations at risk, actual production of required vaccines and related biologics, strategies to maximize prevention but minimize unnecessary human prophylaxis, and a long-term, realistic plan for sustained global program support to achieve success in disease control, prevention, and elimination.","publish_time":"2017-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rupprecht, Charles; Kuzmin, Ivan; Meslin, Francois","journal":"F1000Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f38b7690f9e7ab1069f6b9e28c103de5f6adb96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5325067.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.10416.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28299201/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["canine rabies","rabies virus infection","ancient zoonosis rabies","infectious disease","disease of nature","disease control","prevention","human fatalities","Tens of millions","unnecessary human prophylaxis","improved estimates of canine populations","Genus Lyssavirus","clear majority of human cases","major zoonoses","cost-effective strategies","ultimate reservoirs","Diverse lyssaviruses","tens of thousands","millions of years","successful lyssavirus species","major historical hosts","culling animal populations","actual production of required vaccines","focal pathogen discovery","characterization","therapeutics","risk","applied pathobiological research","de-centralized laboratory-based surveillance","causative agents","mammalian central nervous system","related biologics","global program support","host breadth","viral taxonomy","niche","realistic plan","overt abundance","negative-sense RNA viruses","skunks","mongooses","complementary actions","harmonized approach","excess","comparative","ancestors of taxa","co-evolving","meso-carnivores","developing countries","likely home","date","candidacy","canids","near future","terms of relative distribution","rabid animals","bats","children","highest case fatality","burden","people","progeny","mass vaccination of dogs","considerable progress","bullet-shaped","ferret badgers","raccoons","Chiroptera","Family Rhabdoviridae","century","elimination","true eradication","unknown reasons","treatment"],"language":"en"},

However, little research has been conducted on bat coronaviruses in South Korea. In this study, bat samples (332 oral swabs, 245 fecal samples, 38 urine samples, and 57 bat carcasses) were collected at 33 natural bat habitat sites in South Korea. RT-PCR and sequencing were performed for specific coronavirus genes to identify the bat coronaviruses in different bat samples. Coronaviruses were detected in 2.7% (18/672) of the samples: 13 oral swabs from one species of the family Rhinolophidae, and four fecal samples and one carcass (intestine) from three species of the family Vespertiliodae. To determine the genetic relationships of the 18 sequences obtained in this study and previously known coronaviruses, the nucleotide sequences of a 392-nt region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were analyzed phylogenetically. Thirteen sequences belonging to SARS-like betacoronaviruses showed the highest nucleotide identity (97.1\u201399.7%) with Bat-CoV-JTMC15 reported in China. The other five sequences were most similar to MERS-like betacoronaviruses. Four nucleotide sequences displayed the highest identity (94.1\u201395.1%) with Bat-CoV-HKU5 from Hong Kong. The one sequence from a carcass showed the highest nucleotide identity (99%) with Bat-CoV-SC2013 from China. These results suggest that careful surveillance of coronaviruses from bats should be continued, because animal and human infections may result from the genetic variants present in bat coronavirus reservoirs.","publish_time":"2017-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Saemi; Jo, Seong-Deok; Son, Kidong; An, Injung; Jeong, Jipseol; Wang, Seung-Jun; Kim, Yongkwan; Jheong, Weonhwa; Oem, Jae-Ku","journal":"Microb Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbf86a73100227664edcdc981bbbccb9782602eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079938.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-017-1033-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28725945/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Hong Kong","China"],"keyphrases":["bat coronaviruses","Bat-CoV","different bat samples","bat carcasses","bat coronavirus reservoirs","nucleotide sequences","fecal samples","natural bat habitat sites","urine samples","known coronaviruses","highest nucleotide identity","highest identity","careful surveillance of coronaviruses","oral swabs","species","SARS","South Korea","betacoronaviruses","study","China","Bats","specific coronavirus genes","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","genetic relationships","family Rhinolophidae","family Vespertiliodae","genetic variants present","natural reservoir of severe acute respiratory syndrome","sequencing","RdRp","nt region","HKU5","intestine","human infections","Hong Kong","animal","results","MERS","SC2013","JTMC15","RT-PCR","little research","mammals"],"language":"en"},

At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management. Nuclear medicine staff needs to be aware of the possibility of contact with patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they do not present any symptom. Therefore, safety measures need to be adopted for other patients and hospital staff in order to block the spread of infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Setti, Lucia; Kirienko, Margarita; Dalto, Serena Camilla; Bonacina, Manuela; Bombardieri, Emilio","journal":"Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e9fa7dc5bd1af117b9952b5180cda0417ff927e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184819.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-020-04819-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342191/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PET/CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of patients","CT findings","FDG-PET","CT acquisition","day of PET","symptoms onset","FDG uptake","viral infection","spread of infection","scans","imaging findings suspicious","cancer metastases","probable Covid","onset of mild respiratory symptoms","symptom surveillance","hospital staff","Lung abnormalities","clinical diagnosis of Covid","Peripheral lung consolidations","Nuclear medicine staff","home isolation","pulmonary involvement unrelated","order","ground-glass opacities","medical history","disease","METHODS","absence","treatment","possibility of contact","SARS-CoV","exposure information","patient management","SUVmax","view","week follow-up","lobes","fever","cough","safety measures","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","AIM"],"language":"en"},

An efficient, scalable and cost-effective manufacturing process for Griffithsin is essential for the adoption of this drug in human antiviral prophylaxis and therapy, particularly in cost-sensitive indications such as topical microbicides for HIV-1 prevention. The production of certain classes of recombinant biologics in plants can offer scalability, cost and environmental impact advantages over traditional biomanufacturing platforms. Previously, we showed the technical viability of producing recombinant Griffithsin in plants. In this study, we conducted a technoeconomic analysis (TEA) of plant-produced Griffithsin manufactured at commercial launch volumes for use in HIV microbicides. Data derived from multiple non-sequential manufacturing batches conducted at pilot scale and existing facility designs were used to build a technoeconomic model using SuperPro Designer(\u00AE) modeling software. With an assumed commercial launch volume of 20 kg Griffithsin/year for 6.7 million doses of Griffithsin microbicide at 3 mg/dose, a transient vector expression yield of 0.52 g Griffithsin/kg leaf biomass, recovery efficiency of 70%, and purity of \u003E99%, we calculated a manufacturing cost for the drug substance of $0.32/dose and estimated a bulk product cost of $0.38/dose assuming a 20% net fee for a contract manufacturing organization (CMO). This is the first report modeling the manufacturing economics of Griffithsin. The process analyzed is readily scalable and subject to efficiency improvements and could provide the needed market volumes of the lectin within an acceptable range of costs, even for cost-constrained products such as microbicides. The manufacturing process was also assessed for environmental, health and safety impact and found to have a highly favorable environmental output index with negligible risks to health and safety. The results of this study help validate the plant-based manufacturing platform and should assist in selecting preferred indications for Griffithsin as a novel drug.","publish_time":"2018-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alam, Aatif; Jiang, Linda; Kittleson, Gregory A.; Steadman, Kenneth D.; Nandi, Somen; Fuqua, Joshua L.; Palmer, Kenneth E.; Tus\u00E9, Daniel; McDonald, Karen A.","journal":"Front Bioeng Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f909ff3d201ad4ddc44488137db54eb2a4be076e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6066545.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087892/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2018.00102","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["manufacturing cost","manufacturing economics of Griffithsin","recombinant Griffithsin","g Griffithsin","doses of Griffithsin microbicide","cost-effective manufacturing process","contract manufacturing organization","HIV microbicides","plant-based manufacturing platform","cost-sensitive indications","bulk product cost","cost-constrained products","multiple non-sequential manufacturing batches","environmental impact advantages","commercial launch volumes","topical microbicides","plants","novel drug","drug substance","health","safety impact","favorable environmental output index","assumed commercial launch volume","efficiency improvements","preferred indications","recovery efficiency","technoeconomic analysis","technoeconomic model","study help","modeling software","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","human antiviral prophylaxis","marine algal lectin","needed market volumes","production of certain classes of recombinant biologics","binding oligomannose glycans","pilot scale","negligible risks","scalability","therapy","viral envelope glycoproteins","transient vector expression yield","traditional biomanufacturing platforms","SuperPro Designer","leaf biomass","net fee","adoption","existing facility designs","acceptable range of costs","SARS","HCV","Data","subject","TEA","year","technical viability","enveloped viruses","HSV","CMO","prevention","report","results","purity"],"language":"en"},

Since then, the virus has rapidly spread to many countries. While the outbreak in China appears to be in decline, the disease has spread across the world, with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection-related deaths. Here, we highlight (i) the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease and (ii) an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent COVID-19 and potential future related pandemics. Although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population. Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective. There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available. This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Triggle, Chris R; Bansal, Devendra; Farag, Elmoubasher Abu Baker Abd; Ding, Hong; Sultan, Ali A","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404514/; https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00317-20","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["effective vaccine","impact of COVID","Coronavirus disease","vaccine development","number of drugs","treatment of COVID19","SARS-CoV","status of drug treatment","country","China","lessons","proven effective therapies","novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","ill patients","mortality rate","number of confirmed cases","infection-related deaths","potential future related pandemics","reflecting differences","daily increase","update","local health authorities","clinical trials","absence of data","Wuhan","Hubei province","appropriate testing","world","year","influenza","efforts","prophylaxis","global urgency","progress","evidence","decline","combination","countries","affected population","review","outbreak","diseases"],"language":"en"},

Operational and financial risk factors are highlighted, and the chapter concludes with company portraits.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaiser, Mark J.","journal":"The Offshore Pipeline Construction Industry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/624fb9f341e571b3086380cf16280d83dfa291cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169349.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128202883000081; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128202883000081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["offshore construction companies","chapter","operations","demand","offshore pipeline construction service industry","competitive position","competitive vessels","varying degrees of consolidation","services","alliances","strategies","periods of sustained low oil prices","business models","partnerships","integration","impact","financial risk factors","search of opportunities","geographic region","years","cost","company portraits","contractors","purpose"],"language":"en"},

The developed model was validated by experimentation and by published empirical data. Three stages are identified with respect to time for the variation of the IPE: a first stage dominated by the propagation and decay of the exhaled jet, a particles\u0027 redistribution stage, and a particles\u0027 removal stage. The inhaled dose is affected by the DV flow rate, cough velocity, particle diameter and distance between the occupants. The DV system with a flow rate of 100 L/s reduced significantly the inhaled dose during particle redistribution and removal stages decreasing the total inhaled dose by 83% compared to a flow rate of 50 L/s. IPE is higher when particle diameter is increased from 1 to 20 \u03BCm due to the opposition of particle removal by the upward DV. A comparison between steady and transient modeling of the IPE showed that steady modeling captures the physics affecting particle spread due to HMRA but it over-predicts the inhaled dose. It is found that for a DV flow rate of 100 L/s and a cough velocity of 22 m/s during 1 s, and 1 \u03BCm particles, the minimum required distance between the occupants for a threshold inhaled dose of 10\u22125 kg is nearly 0.5 m by transient modeling while it is 2.15 m by steady state modeling.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Habchi, Carine; Ghali, Kamel; Ghaddar, Nesreen","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2065921ad92c09b0bc985d84127d2a73e2f494c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125956.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.07.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132315300779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288033/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132315300779","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPE","HMRA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DV flow rate","particle redistribution","particle diameter","IPE","transient modeling","total inhaled dose","threshold inhaled dose","steady modeling","opposition of particle removal","upward DV","DV system","particles\u0027 removal stage","steady state modeling","removal stages","particles\u0027 redistribution stage","transient mathematical multi-region zonal transport model of particle behavior","cough velocity","occupants","HMRA","developed model","transient inter-personal exposure","\u03BCm particles","minimum required distance","indoor spaces","high momentum respiratory activities","exhaled jet","work","displacement ventilation","propagation","decay","experimentation","time","physics","respect","variation","systems","comparison","empirical data","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

We previously identified a novel adenovirus, titi monkey adenovirus (TMAdV), as the cause of a fulminant pneumonia outbreak in a colony of titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) at a national primate center in 2009. Serological evidence of infection by TMAdV was also found in a human researcher at the facility and household family member, raising concerns for potential cross-species transmission of the virus. Here we present experimental evidence of cross-species TMAdV infection in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Nasal inoculation of a cell cultured-adapted TMAdV strain into three marmosets produced an acute, mild respiratory illness characterized by low-grade fever, reduced activity, anorexia, and sneezing. An increase in virus-specific neutralization antibody titers accompanied the development of clinical signs. Although serially collected nasal swabs were positive for TMAdV for at least 8 days, all 3 infected marmosets spontaneously recovered by day 12 post-inoculation, and persistence of the virus in tissues could not be established. Thus, the pathogenesis of experimental inoculation of TMAdV in common marmosets resembled the mild, self-limiting respiratory infection typically seen in immunocompetent human hosts rather than the rapidly progressive, fatal pneumonia observed in 19 of 23 titi monkeys during the prior 2009 outbreak. These findings further establish the potential for adenovirus cross-species transmission and provide the basis for development of a monkey model useful for assessing the zoonotic potential of adenoviruses.","publish_time":"2013-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Guixia; Yagi, Shigeo; Carrion, Ricardo; Chen, Eunice C.; Liu, Maria; Brasky, Kathleen M.; Lanford, Robert E.; Kelly, Kristi R.; Bales, Karen L.; Schnurr, David P.; Canfield, Don R.; Patterson, Jean L.; Chiu, Charles Y.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6761b66c1494299587710188e9a371713d88450.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3722195.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23894316/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068558","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species TMAdV infection","common marmosets","pathogenesis of experimental inoculation of TMAdV","potential cross-species transmission","adenovirus cross-species transmission","adapted TMAdV strain","titi monkey adenovirus","infected marmosets","Nasal inoculation","experimental evidence of cross","self-limiting respiratory infection","colony of titi monkeys","novel adenovirus","Serological evidence of infection","zoonotic potential of adenoviruses","post-inoculation","mild respiratory illness","fulminant pneumonia outbreak","immunocompetent human hosts","human researcher","fatal pneumonia","nasal swabs","virus-specific neutralization antibody titers","monkey model useful","development of clinical signs","number of vertebrate hosts","low-grade fever","concerns","Callicebus cupreus","household family member","reduced activity","anorexia","facility","persistence","basis","cell","Callithrix jacchus","increase","days","cause","national primate center","DNA viruses","epidemic disease","humans","sneezing","tissues","findings"],"language":"en"},

The vaccine\u2019s planned initial indication under investigation is for prevention of CMV reactivation in CMV-seropositive (CMV(\u002B)) recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 proof-of-concept study provided initial evidence of the safety of this product in CMV(\u002B) HCT recipients who underwent immune ablation conditioning regimens. This study revealed a significant reduction in viral load endpoints and increased frequencies of pp65-specific interferon-\u03B3-producing T cells in vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients. The results of this endpoint-defining trial provided the basis for defining the primary and secondary endpoints of a global phase 3 trial in HCT recipients.

This prospective longitudinal study investigated the factors that predict psychological resilience in adults undergoing genetic testing for HCRC. METHODS -: A longitudinal study was carried out from April 2003 to August 2006 on Hong Kong Chinese HCRC family members who were recruited and offered genetic testing by the Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancer Registry to determine psychological outcomes after genetic testing. Self-completed questionnaires were administered immediately before (pre-disclosure baseline) and 2 weeks, 4 months and 1 year after result disclosure. Using validated psychological inventories, the cognitive style of hope was measured at baseline, and the psychological distress of depression and anxiety was measured at all time points. RESULTS -: Of the 76 participating subjects, 71 individuals (43 men and 28 women; mean age 38.9 \u00B1 9.2 years) from nine FAP and 24 HNPCC families completed the study, including 39 mutated gene carriers. Four patterns of outcome trajectories were created using established norms for the specified outcome measures of depression and anxiety. These included chronic dysfunction (13% and 8.7%), recovery (0% and 4.3%), delayed dysfunction (13% and 15.9%) and resilience (76.8% and 66.7%). Two logistic regression analyses were conducted using hope at baseline to predict resilience, with depression and anxiety employed as outcome indicators. Because of the small number of participants, the chronic dysfunction and delayed dysfunction groups were combined into a non-resilient group for comparison with the resilient group in all subsequent analysis. Because of low frequencies, participants exhibiting a recovery trajectory (n = 3 for anxiety and n = 0 for depression) were excluded from further analysis. Both regression equations were significant. Baseline hope was a significant predictor of a resilience outcome trajectory for depression (B = -0.24, p \u003C 0.01 for depression); and anxiety (B = -0.11, p = 0.05 for anxiety). CONCLUSIONS -: The current findings suggest that hopefulness may predict resilience after HCRC genetic testing in Hong Kong Chinese. Interventions to increase the level of hope may be beneficial to the psychological adjustment of CRC genetic testing recipients.","publish_time":"2010-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Samuel MY; Ho, Judy WC; Bonanno, George A; Chu, Annie TW; Chan, Emily MS","journal":"BMC Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2891641.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20537192/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-10-279","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCRC","Cancer Registry"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["anxiety","psychological resilience","HCRC genetic testing","psychological distress of depression","Baseline hope","psychological adjustment of CRC genetic testing recipients","resilience outcome trajectory","psychological outcomes","significant psychological consequences","specified outcome measures of depression","chronic dysfunction","validated psychological inventories","outcome indicators","level of hope","pre-disclosure baseline","delayed dysfunction groups","Hong Kong Chinese HCRC family members","significant predictor","resilient group","cognitive style of hope","patterns of outcome trajectories","recovery trajectory","prospective longitudinal study","hereditary colorectal cancer","Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancer Registry","test recipients","regression equations","subsequent analysis","small number of participants","logistic regression analyses","Self-completed questionnaires","established norms","factors","adults","weeks","hopefulness","individuals","mean age","women","comparison","current findings","low frequencies","FAP","participating subjects","years","months","HNPCC families","mutated gene carriers","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","Interventions","time points","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for rhinovirus and enterovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza A and B virus, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results Virus infection was documented in 80% of patients with croup and 71% of control subjects. Children with croup had significantly more positive test results for PIV 1 and 2 (31% vs 4% and 6% vs 0%, respectively) and significantly fewer positive test results for RSV (15% vs 28%) than wheezing children. Rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were present equally in both groups (21% vs 25%). There was no significant difference in the frequency of influenza A virus or human bocavirus. Few subjects with adenovirus or M. pneumoniae were detected. Conclusion Acute laryngeal croup is most often associated with PIV, RSV, rhinovirus, and enterovirus. Rhinovirus and enterovirus appeared equally often in croup and in wheezing illness.

Methods Outpatient records for acute upper respiratory infections (ICD9 CM codes: 460, 462, 463,464, 465.9 and 487) in a randomly selected sample (n=39,766 children in 2005) was used to estimate the cumulative relative risks (RR) associated with average temperature lasting for 8 days (lag 0\u20137 days), air pollutants (NO2, O3 and PM2.5) lasting for 6 days (lag 0\u20135 days), and virus-specific positive isolation rate lasting for 11 days (lag 0\u201310 days) using distributed lag non-linear models after controlling for relative humidity, wind speed, day of week, holiday effects and long-term trend.

Although novel ligands have been identified by these methods, it has become clear that screening hit lists are plagued by false positives. These nuisance compounds are ultimately found to be developmental dead-ends and are abandoned, often after considerable effort has been invested in them. Much work over the last decade has been devoted to exploring the origins of false-positive screening hits, and ligand promiscuity has emerged as one such cause. Well-known mechanisms of promiscuity include reactive species and privileged substructures. More recently, it has been found that some nonspecific screening hits form aggregates of 30\u20131000nm in diameter. It has been proposed that these aggregate particles are responsible for the promiscuous behavior of many false positives and that aggregate-forming compounds may be widespread among screening hits. This chapter will review the known mechanisms of ligand promiscuity with an emphasis on the recently described model of aggregation. Experimental and computational methods for identifying promiscuous compounds will be described, and some outstanding questions in the field will be considered.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGovern, S.

METHODS: The Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project conducts ILI surveillance in 3 primary care clinics in New York City, and MoSAIC conducts community\u2010based ILI/ARI surveillance through text messaging among a cohort of New York City residents. Both systems obtain respiratory specimens from participants with ILI/ARI and test for multiple pathogens. We conducted a retrospective review of ILI cases in IISP and MoSAIC from January 2013 to May 2015 with descriptive analyses of clinical and laboratory data. RESULTS: Five\u2010hundred twelve MoSAIC and 669 IISP participants met an ILI criteria (fever with cough or sore throat) and were included. Forty percent of MoSAIC participants sought care; the majority primary care. Pathogens were detected in 63% of MoSAIC and 70% of IISP cases. The relative distribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses detected was similar; however, there were statistically significant differences in the frequency that were not explained by care seeking. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient and community\u2010based surveillance in the one found similar timing and relative distribution of respiratory viruses, but community surveillance in a single neighborhood may not fully capture the variations in ILI etiology that occur more broadly.","publish_time":"2018-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russell, Kate E.; Fowlkes, Ashley; Stockwell, Melissa S.; Vargas, Celibell Y.; Saiman, Lisa; Larson, Elaine L.; LaRussa, Philip; Di Lonardo, Steve; Popowich, Michael; St. George, Kirsten; Steffens, Andrea; Reed, Carrie","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7918e26f09ad06f1336fd3f15c8c5f875ecfcabd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5907822.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29350791/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","Centers for Disease Control","Mobile Surveillance for Acute Respiratory Infections","Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Surveillance of influenza","community surveillance","ARI surveillance","based surveillance","Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project conducts ILI surveillance","Mobile Surveillance","based ILI","ILI criteria","ILI etiology","Prevention Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project","community settings","IISP participants","percent of MoSAIC participants","retrospective review of ILI cases","respiratory specimens","relative distribution of respiratory viruses","relative distribution of influenza","IISP cases","care seeking","Acute Respiratory Infections","primary care clinics","majority primary care","outpatient","illness","cohort of New York City residents","medical settings","similar timing","significant differences","multiple pathogens","significant burden of non\u2010","Disease Control","Centers","text messaging","fever","cough","test","descriptive analyses of clinical","laboratory data","United States","consistency","METHODS","sore throat","single neighborhood","variations","frequency","systems","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","Study","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated the capability of disinfectants to both inactivate PEDV and sufficiently damage viral RNA beyond RT-PCR detection. Five classes of disinfectants (phenol, quaternary ammonium compound, sodium hypochlorite, oxidizing agent, and quaternary ammonium/glutaraldehyde combination) were evaluated in vitro at varying concentrations, both in the presence and absence of swine feces, and at three different temperatures. No infectious PEDV was recovered after treatment with evaluated disinfectants. Additionally, all tested disinfectants except for 0.17% sodium hypochlorite dramatically reduced qRT-PCR values. However, no disinfectants eliminated RT-PCR detection of PEDV across all replicates; although, 0.52%, 1.03% and 2.06% solutions of sodium hypochlorite and 0.5% oxidizing agent did intermittently produce RT-PCR negatives. To simulate field conditions in a second aim, PEDV was applied to pitted aluminum coupons, which were then treated with either 2.06% sodium hypochlorite or 0.5% oxidizing agent. Post-treatment surface swabs of the coupons tested RT-PCR positive but were not infectious to cultured cells or na\u00EFve pigs. Ultimately, viable PEDV was not detected following application of each of the tested disinfectants, however in most cases RT-PCR detection of viral RNA remained.

It has previously been shown that the adoptive transfer of 5 \u00D7 107 nylon wool adherent (NWA) spleen cells from immunized donors to lethally infected recipients clears virus from the central nervous system (CNS) and prevents demyelination. Adoptive transfer of a smaller number (1 \u00D7 107) of NWA spleen cells from immunized donors also protects from death but does not significantly alter virus replication in the CNS during the acute phase of the infection. Moreover, these mice develop a transient non-fatal encephalomyelitis which occurs approximately 3 weeks post-infection. This delayed encephalomyelitis is associated with a mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS but little or no evidence of virus replication or increased viral antigen. A virus-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response precedes this delayed onset of disease by 24 to 48 h. Resolution of disease correlates with a selective and permanent suppression of the JHMV-specific DTH reactivity. In addition, no virus-specific DTH is detected following adoptive transfer of viral-specific DTH effectors derived from immunized donors. In contrast, these mice respond to a heterologous antigen, KLH, suggesting that the resolution of the encephalitis is accompanied by a profound suppression in viral-specific DTH response.","publish_time":"1990-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shubin, Richard A.; Sussman, Mark A.; Fleming, John O.; Stohlman, Stephen A.","journal":"Microbial Pathogenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c47053cbb34cd69de7c9b852a52183d7e5cffd5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0882401090900899; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0882401090900899","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NWA","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-specific DTH","viral-specific DTH response","specific DTH effectors","evidence of virus replication","JHMV-specific DTH reactivity","virus-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity","immunized donors","CNS","delayed encephalomyelitis","following adoptive transfer of viral","viral antigen","NWA spleen cells","JHM strain mouse hepatitis virus","delayed onset of disease","Abstract Mice","evidence of demyelination","transient non-fatal encephalomyelitis","Resolution of disease correlates","permanent suppression","profound suppression","infected recipients","heterologous antigen","weeks post-infection","nylon wool adherent","central nervous system","mononuclear cell infiltration","acute phase","KLH","encephalitis","smaller number","death","addition","contrast"],"language":"en"},

In this article, we reflect on how insights from the literature on career shocks can help us understand the career consequences of the pandemic and offer suggestions for future research in this area. In particular, we offer three \u201Ckey lessons\u201D. The first lesson is that the implications of Covid-19 reflect the dynamic interplay between individual and contextual factors. Here, we argue that although the pandemic was difficult to predict and control, research shows that certain psychological resources \u2013 such as career competencies and resilience \u2013 could make this career shock more manageable. The second lesson is that the pandemic may have differential implications over time, as suggested by research that has shown the consequences of career shocks to differ between short-term vs. long-term time horizons, and across life- and career stages. The third lesson is that, even though the pandemic is clearly a negatively valenced shock for most people, further into the future it may allow for more positive outcomes. This lesson builds on research showing how negative career shocks have long-term positive consequences for some people. We hope that these insights will inspire both scholars and practitioners to study and understand the work and career implications of Covid-19 as a career shock, as well as to support people in dealing with its consequences.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akkermans, Jos; Richardson, Julia; Kraimer, Maria","journal":"J Vocat Behav","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58977e3b090b79249467ba10c8e308d8aa4af92b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205633.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879120300592?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32390655/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001879120300592; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2020.103434","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["career consequences","consequences of career shocks","career competencies","career stages","career implications of Covid","pandemic","negative career shocks","future research","long-term positive consequences","valenced shock","support people","insights","differential implications","long-term time horizons","positive outcomes","certain psychological resources","dynamic interplay","control","life","work","suggestions","contextual factors","practitioners","study","resilience","scholars","area","literature","globe","key lessons","article"],"language":"en"},

These outbreaks urgently call for updated and effective PEDV vaccines. Better understanding in PEDV biology and improvement in technological platforms for virus production can immensely assist and accelerate PEDV vaccine development. In this study, we explored the ability of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein in improving viral yields in cell culture systems. We demonstrated that PEDV N expression positively affected both recovery of PEDV from infectious clones and PEDV propagation in cell culture. Compared to Vero E6 cells, Vero E6 cells expressing PEDV N could accelerate growth of a slow-growing PEDV strain to higher peak titers by 12 hours or enhance the yield of a vaccine candidate strain by two orders of magnitude. Interestingly, PEDV N also slightly enhances replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus, a PEDV relative in the Nidovirales order. These results solidify the importance of N in PEDV recovery and propagation and suggest a potentially useful consideration in designing vaccine production platforms for PEDV or closely related pathogens.","publish_time":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liwnaree, Benjamas; Narkpuk, Jaraspim; Sungsuwan, Suttipun; Jongkaewwattana, Anan; Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51a731857c1606428ec1eb47a97a290d2084c460.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6402621.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840701/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212632","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV propagation","recovery of PEDV","PEDV recovery","PEDV biology","PEDV relative","PEDV N expression","PEDV vaccine development","ability of PEDV nucleocapsid","effective PEDV vaccines","slow-growing PEDV strain","importance of N","virus production","vaccine production platforms","respiratory virus","Vero E6 cells","vaccine candidate strain","emerging strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","cell culture systems","technological platforms","cause severe diarrhea","replication of porcine reproductive","improvement","substantial economic loss","high mortality rates","infected piglets","higher peak titers","infectious clones","viral yields","protein","growth","worldwide swine industry","useful consideration","hours","Better understanding","orders of magnitude","related pathogens","Nidovirales order","results","outbreaks","study"],"language":"en"},

The continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012. Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has been mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries. Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date. In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present outbreaks. The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ashour, Hossam M.; Elkhatib, Walid F.; Rahman, Md.

A case herd was defined as a swine herd with clinical signs and a positive test result for PEDV. A questionnaire was used to a gather 30-day history of herd management practices, animal movements on/off site, feed management practices, semen deliveries and biosecurity practices for case (n = 8) and control (n = 12) herds, primarily located in Ontario. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and random forests (RFs). Case herds were larger in size than control herds. Case herds had more animal movements and non-staff movements onto the site. Also, case herds had higher quantities of pigs delivered, feed deliveries and semen deliveries on-site. The biosecurity practices of case herds were considered more rigorous based on herd management, feed deliveries, transportation and truck driver practices than control herds. The RF model found that the most important variables for predicting herd status were related to herd size and feed management variables.

SST is manufactured in Japan as an ethical drug on a modern industrial scale in which the quality of ingredients is standardized with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regulation. SST is widely used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis. Experimental and clinical studies including multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies have demonstrated the various pharmacological effects of SST. SST is prepared from the hot water extraction of seven raw materials, therefore many kinds of constituents are included. Three-dimensional (3D) HPLC analysis is useful for obtaining many kinds of constituents, especially low molecular ultraviolet (UV) quenching compounds, contained in SST as well as its fractions. Fingerprint pattern provided by 3D HPLC analysis makes possible to identify the overall-viewing of SST. Databases of UV spectra of the components of medicinal herbs obtained by reversed-phase (RP) HPLC using a photodiode array (PDA) and fingerprint patterns of crude drugs made by 3D HPLC analysis facilitate the identification, analysis and quality of herbal drugs. Studies using both PDA HPLC and an amino acid analysis with a fluorometric detector have found that SST contains fifteen major low molecular compounds (i.e. baicalin, wogonin-7-O-glucuronide, liquiritin, their three aglycons, liquiritin apioside, glycyrrhizin, saikosaponin b1, saikosaponin b2, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, (6)-gingerol, (6)-shogaol and arginine). These compounds have various pharmacological actions, and are assumed to be responsible, at least partly, for the pharmacological effects of SST. Although there have only been a few investigations on high molecular compounds with pharmacological actions contained in SST, several kinds of polysaccharides have been isolated from constituent herbs of SST. This review paper summarizes analytical methods of separation, isolation and identification of compounds with biological activities from SST, which is a mixture drug of medicinal herbs. Accordingly, this paper would not focus on methods of separation, isolation and analysis of particular compounds from each constituent herb of SST.","publish_time":"2004-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ohtake, Nobuhiro; Nakai, Yoichiro; Yamamoto, Masahiro; Sakakibara, Iwao; Takeda, Shuichi; Amagaya, Sakae; Aburada, Masaki","journal":"J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4dd7634d4672eb04e438deac4c36c4ec3b15098.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105231.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570023204005471; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570023204005471","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SST","HPLC","PDA HPLC"],"locations":["Japan","China"],"keyphrases":["constituent herbs of SST","constituent herb of SST","various pharmacological effects of SST","D HPLC analysis","analysis of particular compounds","identification of compounds","quenching compounds","PDA HPLC","high molecular compounds","major low molecular compounds","amino acid analysis","various pharmacological actions","kinds of constituents","isolation","clinical studies","double-blind studies","mixture drug of medicinal herbs","components of medicinal herbs","kinds of polysaccharides","analytical methods of separation","representative Kampo medicine","traditional Japanese medicine","oriental classical medicine","quality of herbal drugs","saikosaponin b1","saikosaponin b2","ginsenoside Rg1","ginsenoside Rb1","liquiritin apioside","fingerprint patterns of crude drugs","quality of ingredients","ethical drug","review paper","Databases of UV spectra","glycyrrhizin","placebo","baicalin","multi-center","raw materials","Good Manufacturing Practices","photodiode array","modern industrial scale","aglycons","wogonin","fluorometric detector","hot water extraction","biological activities","GMP","regulation","O-glucuronide","China","phase","investigations","years","treatment of chronic hepatitis","shogaol","gingerol","Sho-saiko","arginine","fractions"],"language":"en"},

To kill these cancer cells, we need a novel therapeutic approach other than EGFR inhibitors. If a molecule is specifically expressed on the cell surface of such EGFR-independent EGFR-mutant cancer cells, it can be a therapeutic target. We found that a mesenchymal EGFR-independent subline derived from HCC827 cells, an EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line, expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to a greater extent than its parental cells. ACE2 was also expressed at least partially in most of the primary EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas examined, and the ACE2 expression level in the cancer cells was much higher than that in normal lung epithelial cells. In addition, we developed an anti-ACE2 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), termed H8R64, that was internalized by ACE2-expressing cells. If an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a humanized mAb based on H8R64 and a potent anticancer drug were produced, it could be effective for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas.","publish_time":"2017-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamaguchi, Miki; Hirai, Sachie; Sumi, Toshiyuki; Tanaka, Yusuke; Tada, Makoto; Nishii, Yukari; Hasegawa, Tadashi; Uchida, Hiroaki; Yamada, Gen; Watanabe, Atsushi; Takahashi, Hiroki; Sakuma, Yuji","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d4106215f4d9cc9189f90d1beac917bdf3d9b09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092918.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X17307775; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.04.102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28433633/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X17307775","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EGFR-independent EGFR-mutant cancer cells","treatment of EGFR","EGFR inhibitors","Abstract EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas","primary EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas","HCC827 cells","subpopulation of cells","parental cells","normal lung epithelial cells","EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line","mesenchymal EGFR-independent subline","ACE2 expression level","anti-ACE2 mouse monoclonal antibody","antibody-drug conjugate","humanized mAb","cell surface","termed H8R64","therapeutic target","mesenchymal transition","novel therapeutic approach","potent anticancer drug","angiotensin","greater extent","enzyme","addition","molecule"],"language":"en"},

We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model. Thus, we speculated that knowledge of the functional changes in the NS7b and NS8 proteins during evolution may provide important information to explore the human infective property of 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fahmi, Muhamad; Kubota, Yukihiko; Ito, Masahiro","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df353c05aae43b69987088703edbdefa1382ef4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106073.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820301039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820301039; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32142938/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Clade"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV proteins","NS8 proteins","translated proteins","proteins exclusive","nonstructural proteins","group of conserved proteins","SARS coronavirus","phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins","novel coronavirus","NS7b","species of Orthocoronavirinae","Nucleocapsid protein","Membrane protein","Bat-SARS","novel human infecting Betacoronavirus","genome sequences","cluster tree","phylogenetic tree","evolutionary relationship","SARS-CoV experimental model","human infective property","subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus","human respiratory illness","Orf1ab polyprotein","Spike glycoprotein","important information","pneumonia","functional changes","profiles","clades","BatCoV RaTG13","absence of homologs","presence","BatSARS","BetaCoV","Hibecovirus","immune response","knowledge","Wuhan","China","combined data","analysis"],"language":"en"},

The response is frequently characterized by a series of emergency activities to contain and manage the infection in human populations, and at the same time to identify the source of the infection in nature. If infection is found to have a source in animals, and if animals cause a continuous threat of human infection, culling is often recommended with severe economic impact. Currently, efforts are being undertaken for closer interaction at the animal/human interface through joint surveillance and risk assessment between the animal and human medicine sectors, and research is underway in geographic areas where emergence at the animal/human interface has occurred in the past. The goal of this research is to identify infectious organisms in tropical and other wild animals, to genetically sequence these organisms, and to attempt to predict which organisms have the potential to emerge in human populations. It may be more cost-effective to learn from past emergence events, and to shift the paradigm from disease surveillance, detection, and response in humans; to prevention of emergence at the source by understanding and mitigating the factors, or determinants, that influence animal infection. These determinants are clearly understood from the study of previous emergence events and include human-induced changes in natural environments, urban areas, and agricultural systems; raising and processing animal-based foods; and the roles of global trade, migration, and climate change. Better understanding of these factors learned from epidemiological investigation of past and present emergence events, and modeling and study of the cost-effectiveness of interventions that could result in their mitigation, could provide evidence necessary to better address the political and economic barriers to prevention of infections in animals. Such economically convincing arguments for change and mitigation are required because of the basic difference in animal health\u2014driven by the need for profit; and human health\u2014driven by the need to save lives.","publish_time":"2012-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heymann, David L.; Dixon, Mathew","journal":"One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2643a2b2255383cae69846e034f009e169b0246b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121159.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2012_285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23239233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human interface","human health","human populations","animal interface","animal health","influence animal infection","prevention of emergence","past emergence events","continuous threat of human infection","source","human-induced changes","human medicine sectors","wild animals","present emergence events","study of previous emergence events","processing animal-based foods","infectious organisms","prevention of infections","research","mitigation","factors","need","humans","response","determinants","Better understanding","epidemiological investigation of past","urban areas","joint surveillance","geographic areas","disease surveillance","economic barriers","climate change","severe economic impact","majority of emerging infectious diseases","risk assessment","natural environments","culling","agricultural systems","roles of global trade","migration","detection","modeling","species barrier","closer interaction","paradigm","basic difference","evidence necessary","cost-effectiveness of interventions","convincing arguments","profit","potential","series of emergency activities","efforts","time","nature","goal","lives"],"language":"en"},

While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible and actionable the information produced by these studies was. METHODS To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomenon related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility and clarity by independent reviewers. RESULTS 2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R0 (basic reproductive number) and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barr\u00E9 Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%) and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%) and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail allowing complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies. CONCLUSIONS Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates that there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response, it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. Author summary Researchers published many studies which sought to predict and forecast important features of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections and their spread during the 2016-2017 ZIKV pandemic. We conducted a comprehensive review of such ZIKV prediction studies and evaluated their aims, the data sources they used, which methods were used, how timely they were published, and whether they provided sufficient information to be used or reproduced by others. Of the 73 studies evaluated, we found that the accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates that there is substantial room for improvement. We identified that the release of study findings before formal journal publication (\u2018pre-prints\u2019) increased the timeliness of Zika prediction studies, but note they were infrequently used during this public health emergency. Addressing these areas can improve our understanding of Zika and other outbreaks and ensure that forecasts can inform preparedness and response to future outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics.","publish_time":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kobres, P-Y; Chretien, JP; Johansson, MA; Morgan, J; Whung, P-Y; Mukundan, H; Del Valle, SY; Forshey, BM; Quandelacy, TM; Biggerstaff, M; Viboud, C; Pollett, S","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1dc991b5d19ae5cc1f112eb9758af6a3fdb135b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5b9a15ad62b0e85fcb5012e7e08e5183b4da786b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/634832","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","PRISMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV prediction studies","percent of studies","Eligible studies","published predictions","timeliness of Zika prediction studies","accessibility of ZIKV predictions","numerous predictive studies","African-specific studies","Zika pandemic","recent ZIKV pandemic","behavioral data","demographic data","sharing of model data","common data sources","percent of predictions","future outbreaks","Real-time internet data","prediction tools","actionable information","understanding of Zika","sufficient information","METHODS","incorporation of uncertainty","complete reproducibility","important features of Zika virus","support of future infectious disease outbreaks","systematic review","comprehensive review","pathogen genomic information","use of preprints","relevant model code","epidemic dynamics","epidemic peak","pandemics","substantial room","improvement","Americas","formal journal publication","grey literature review","journal publication dates","INTRODUCTION Epidemic forecasting","midst of emerging epidemics","outbreak response","functional use of mathematical modeling","modeling efforts","Spatial spread","utility of analytical tools","basic reproductive number","days","evaluation of objectives","R0","clarity","potential","pre-prints\u2019","release of study findings","aims","social science","Guillain-Barr\u00E9 Syndrome burden","MEDLINE","EMBASE","epidemiological phenomenon","preparedness","PRISMA guidelines","infections","independent reviewers","Deterministic models","stochastic approaches","forecasts","Author summary Researchers","sexual transmission risk","public health emergency","vector","eligibility criteria","areas","populations","CONCLUSIONS","Case count","intervention impact","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Surprisingly, low-producing MBL genetic variants that may predispose children and immunocompromised individuals to infectious diseases are more common than would be expected in human populations. Since certain immune defense molecules, such as immunoglobulins, can be exploited by invasive pathogens, we hypothesized that MBL might also enhance infections in some circumstances. Consequently, the low and intermediate MBL levels commonly found in human populations might be the result of balancing selection. Using model infection systems with pseudotyped and authentic glycosylated viruses, we demonstrated that MBL indeed enhances infection of Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and West Nile viruses in low complement conditions. Mechanistic studies with Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein pseudotyped lentiviruses confirmed that MBL binds to N-linked glycan epitopes on viral surfaces in a specific manner via the MBL carbohydrate recognition domain, which is necessary for enhanced infection. MBL mediates lipid-raft-dependent macropinocytosis of EBOV via a pathway that appears to require less actin or early endosomal processing compared with the filovirus canonical endocytic pathway. Using a validated RNA interference screen, we identified C1QBP (gC1qR) as a candidate surface receptor that mediates MBL-dependent enhancement of EBOV infection. We also identified dectin-2 (CLEC6A) as a potentially novel candidate attachment factor for EBOV. Our findings support the concept of an innate immune haplotype that represents critical interactions between MBL and complement component C4 genes and that may modify susceptibility or resistance to certain glycosylated pathogens. Therefore, higher levels of native or exogenous MBL could be deleterious in the setting of relative hypocomplementemia which can occur genetically or because of immunodepletion during active infections. Our findings confirm our hypothesis that the pressure of infectious diseases may have contributed in part to evolutionary selection of MBL mutant haplotypes.","publish_time":"2013-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brudner, Matthew; Karpel, Marshall; Lear, Calli; Chen, Li; Yantosca, L.

We discuss the major mechanisms by which USP28 is involved in the cancer-related pathways, whereby USP28 regulates physiological homeostasis of ubiquitination process, DNA-damage response, and cell cycle during genotoxic stress. We further review the studies where USP28 was targeted for treating multiples cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, intestinal cancers, gliomas, and bladder cancer. As a result, the clinical significance of targeting USP28 for cancer therapy merits further exploration and demonstration.","publish_time":"2018-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiaofang; Liu, Zhiyi; Zhang, Li; Yang, Zhaozhi; Chen, Xingxing; Luo, Jurui; Zhou, Zhirui; Mei, Xin; Yu, Xiaoli; Shao, Zhimin; Feng, Yan; Fu, Shen; Zhang, Zhen; Wei, Dongping; Jia, Lijun; Ma, Jinli; Guo, Xiaomao","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecf2675fbb7883ca4a8f98c34eadb55c6b857aaa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5833459.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29415985/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-017-0208-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cancer pathways","breast cancer","cancer therapy","bladder cancer","cancer-related pathways","non-small cell lung cancer","emerging roles of USP28","cell cycle","cell-cycle progression","clinical significance of targeting USP28","physiological homeostasis of ubiquitination process","intestinal cancers","multiples cancers","versatile roles","important mechanism","recent studies","important post-translational modifications","DNA-damage response","gliomas","protein metabolism","E3 ligases","apoptosis","exploration","deubiquitylating enzymes","genotoxic stress","result","transcription","demonstration","activities","article","major mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Beef and dairy cattle are considered the most important animal reservoirs for this pathogen. One of the important virulence characteristics of E. coli O157:H7 is the eaeA gene encoding the 97 kDa surface protein intimin. Intimin is required for attachment and effacement during the interaction of enterohemorrhagic E. coli with human and bovine neonatal enterocytes. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an adaptive mucosal immune response directed against intimin will reduce or prevent enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle. RESULTS: Cattle were orally inoculated with either milk (control), milk with live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin (vector), or milk with live attenuated recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin (vaccinated) on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 98, all calves were challenged orally with E. coli O157:H7 to evaluate whether vaccination with the recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin would reduce the level of E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding. During the first 28 days, vaccinated calves shed both the vector strain and the intimin-expressing S. Dublin strain at a similar level. The vector strain was shed for a significantly longer period as compared to the level of recombinant vaccine strain. Calves that received the intimin-expressed vaccine ceased shedding S. Dublin from day 28 to day 63. All calves were challenged with E. coli O157:H7 on day 98 to determine the effect on fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7. The amount of E. coli O157:H7 in feces was measured for 30 days post-challenge. We observed a transient clearance of E. coli O157:H7 from the feces in the vaccinated calves. The magnitude of fecal E. coli O157:H7 shedding did not correlate with the presence of intimin-specific fecal IgA. CONCLUSION: Oral vaccination with live attenuated recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin reduced enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7. However, the transient clearance of E. coli O157:H7 was not associated with an enhanced IgA-mediated mucosal immune response.","publish_time":"2010-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khare, Sangeeta; Alali, Walid; Zhang, Shuping; Hunter, Doris; Pugh, Roberta; Fang, Ferric C; Libby, Stephen J; Adams, L Garry","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/284b00ca025a939e64aefb5129b9e942c065baaf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2912257.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-6-35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20609252/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","S.

The communicable diseases of the respiratory tract are probably the most common cause of symptomatic human infections. The viruses that are causative agents for human respiratory disease comprise the five taxonomically distinct families: orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae, picornaviridae, coronaviridae, and adenoviridae. The influenza viruses, which consist of types A, B, and C, belong to the family orthomyxoviridae. Types A and B have been associated with significant increases in mortality during epidemics. The disease may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms ranging from the common cold to fatal pneumonia. Immunization against influenza has been recommended for high-risk groups and antiviral chemotherapy (amantadine) is available for the treatment and prophylaxis of all influenza A infections. There is both a great need for and interest in developing a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of these two viral, respiratory tract pathogens. The family picornaviridae contains the genus Rhinovirus that is composed of over a hundred distinct serotypes. Amantadine and rimantadine are specifically active against influenza A virus infections. The amantadine recipients reported a higher incidence of side effects largely attributed to the central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. This difference in side effects may be a pharmacokinetic phenomenon that results in higher plasma concentrations of amantadine. Significant progress continues to be made in the clinical use and development of agents active against DNA viruses. Acyclovir (9-(2-h droxyethoxymethyl)guanine) has been the subject of several reviews and of a syrnposium. Considerable progress has been made in evaluating the clinical promise of acyclovir; however, there remains much to be learned concerning the best use of this drug in clinical practice. Significant strides have been made in the development of clinically useful antiviral agents, especially against the DNA viruses of the herpes family. Most of these agents are directed against viral nucleic acid synthesis and require activation by a virus-induced thymidine kinase. Researchers have begun to focus on other strategies that may produce broader spectrum anti-viral agents with different mechanisms of action.","publish_time":"1984-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelley, James L.","journal":"Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa30cc76755fb52ffc74b2dfd43497e54a4103cd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0065-7743(08)60688-0; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065774308606880; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065774308606880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336813/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","causative agents","DNA viruses","development of agents active","useful antiviral agents","RNA viruses","clinical use","amantadine recipients","virus infections","family picornaviridae","family orthomyxoviridae","Significant progress","broader spectrum anti-viral agents","human respiratory disease","cause symptoms","common cause of symptomatic human infections","higher plasma concentrations of amantadine","respiratory tract pathogens","treatment","effects","clinical practice","herpes family","significant increases","clinical promise of acyclovir","Significant strides","viral nucleic acid synthesis","antiviral chemotherapy","higher incidence","distinct families","best use","distinct serotypes","Considerable progress","virus-induced thymidine kinase","activation","different mechanisms of action","paramyxoviridae","high-risk groups","central nervous system","pharmacokinetic phenomenon","CNS","coronaviridae","chapter","drug","activity","prophylaxis","guanine","strategies","fatal pneumonia","mortality","epidemics","Publisher Summary","genus Rhinovirus","communicable diseases","rimantadine","reviews","subject","h droxyethoxymethyl","chemotherapeutic agent","adenoviridae","great need","syrnposium","difference","Immunization","Researchers"],"language":"en"},

The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins can restrict entry of ebolaviruses, influenza A viruses, and other enveloped viruses. However, the breadth and mechanism of the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins are incompletely understood. Here, we employed ebolavirus glycoprotein\u2013pseudotyped vectors and ebolavirus-like particles to address this question. We show that IFITM proteins inhibit the cellular entry of diverse ebolaviruses and demonstrate that type I interferon induces IFITM protein expression in macrophages, major viral targets. Moreover, we show that IFITM proteins block entry of influenza A viruses and ebolaviruses by different mechanisms and provide evidence that antibodies and IFITM proteins can synergistically inhibit cellular entry of ebolaviruses. These results provide insights into the role of IFITM proteins in infection by ebolaviruses and suggest a mechanism by which antibodies, though poorly neutralizing in vitro, might contribute to viral control in vivo.","publish_time":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wrensch, Florian; Karsten, Christina B.; Gnir\u00DF, Kerstin; Hoffmann, Markus; Lu, Kai; Takada, Ayato; Winkler, Michael; Simmons, Graham; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b55b2415bd2adff96e6013f792d281693bf4587.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4564551.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiv255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26034199/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of IFITM proteins","IFITM proteins block entry of influenza","cellular entry of ebolaviruses","antiviral activity of IFITM proteins","cellular entry of diverse ebolaviruses","IFITM protein expression","enveloped viruses","interferon","antibodies","ebolavirus glycoprotein","viral control","major viral targets","macrophages","evidence","different mechanisms","severe threat","nonhuman primates","pseudotyped vectors","infection","particles","humans","insights","public health","breadth","results","question"],"language":"en"},

A higher correlation was found for the nucleotide distance at the 3(rd) nucleotide position of codons and codon usage optimization to the human respiratory tract when BCoV and HCoV-OC43 were compared. An MCC tree based on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) data integrating data from both viruses and hosts into a same analysis indicated three putative host/virus contact dates ranging from 1.54E8 to 2.44E5 years ago, suggesting that an ancestor coronavirus might have followed human evolution.","publish_time":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brand\u00E3o, Paulo Eduardo","journal":"Genet Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/123db7e17bb17a0d4ff1e7ef87cb629d6ac78125.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6136381.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30004106/; https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-4685-gmb-2017-0192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory Human coronavirus OC43","human respiratory tract","respiratory tract codon usage","codon usage optimization","human evolution","HCoV-OC43","role of codon usage evolution","human spillover of Bovine coronavirus","relative synonymous codon usage","deoptimization of viral codon usage","respiratory tracts","respiratory virus of cattle","data","suggested bovine","genomes of BCoV","ancestor coronavirus","virus genes","bovine mRNAs sequences of cholecystokinin","nucleotide distance","nucleotide position of codons","CCK","RSCU","analysis","rd","investigation","MCC tree","surfactant protein","dates","putative host","viruses","emergence","54E8","hosts","44E5 years","paper reports","higher correlation","SFTP1","consideration","Analyses"],"language":"en"},

High-growth properties and narrow tissue tropisms (limited replication in respiratory tracts) were achieved by the adaptation process. Unlike the parent strain, the attenuated strain (K2p170) was safe in day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks since replication of the virus did not induce mortality and nephritis, and rarely induced histological changes in the trachea and kidney after intraocular administration. In day-old broilers, even though coarse spray administration of K2p170 induced clinical signs, ciliostasis, and histopathological lesions in the trachea and the kidney, they were all comparable to birds vaccinated with commercial H120 vaccine. Despite restriction of viral replication in the respiratory tract, K2p170 elicited the production of antiserum with a neutralization index of 4.5. K2p170 provided almost complete protection against both two distinct subgroups of Korean nephropathogenic strain (KM91-like and QX-like subgroup). Furthermore, K2p170 provided significantly greater cross-protection against two heterologous strains (Massachusetts and Korean respiratory strain) than those conferred by the commercial H120 vaccine. K2p170 also had no virulence reversion after five back passages in chickens. In conclusion, K2p170 exhibits a fine balance between attenuation and immunogenicity, possesses cross-protective efficacy, and merits further investigation as a potential live vaccine as an alternative means of protection against the recently emergent nephropathogenic IBV infection in many Eurasian countries.","publish_time":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Hyun Jeong; Youn, Ha Na; Kwon, Ji Sun; Lee, Youn Jeong; Kim, Jae Hong; Lee, Joong Bok; Park, Seung Yong; Choi, In Soo; Song, Chang Seon","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f3fffb6a99b0baa471ddd963ee04bfa71e1bb97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125847.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X10001386; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10001386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20153350/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.01.062","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuated strain","Korean respiratory strain","future IBV vaccine strain","parent strain","coarse spray administration of K2p170","commercial H120 vaccine","distinct subgroups of Korean nephropathogenic strain","strain of infectious bronchitis virus","limited replication","respiratory tracts","emergent nephropathogenic IBV infection","greater cross-protection","complete protection","potential live vaccine","nephropathogenic K2","kidney","trachea","alternative means of protection","restriction of viral replication","serial passages","day-old broilers","intraocular administration","day-old specific-pathogen","cross-protective efficacy","possible use","narrow tissue tropisms","clinical signs","heterologous strains","embryonated chicken eggs","immunogenicity","merits","investigation","free chicks","Massachusetts","High-growth properties","histopathological lesions","fine balance","ciliostasis","production of antiserum","attenuation","KM91","Eurasian countries","nephritis","histological changes","birds","virulence reversion","neutralization index","QX","conclusion","chickens","mortality","adaptation process"],"language":"en"},

Some zoonotic pathogens are transmitted through direct contact, but many others require arthropod vectors, such as blood-feeding insects. In Africa, hematophagous insects often play a key role in the epidemiology of many pathogens; however, their ecology in cave habitats remains poorly known. During the last decades, several investigations carried out in Afrotropical caves suggested the medical and veterinary importance particularly of insect taxa of the Diptera order.

There is a paucity of data regarding the differentiating characteristics of patients with laboratory-confirmed and those negative for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Methods. This is a hospital-based case-control study comparing MERS-CoV\u2013positive patients (cases) with MERS-CoV\u2013negative controls. Results. A total of 17 case patients and 82 controls with a mean age of 60.7 years and 57 years, respectively (P = .553), were included. No statistical differences were observed in relation to sex, the presence of a fever or cough, and the presence of a single or multilobar infiltrate on chest radiography. The case patients were more likely to be overweight than the control group (mean body mass index, 32 vs 27.8; P = .035), to have diabetes mellitus (87% vs 47%; odds ratio [OR], 7.24; P = .015), and to have end-stage renal disease (33% vs 7%; OR, 7; P = .012). At the time of admission, tachypnea (27% vs 60%; OR, 0.24; P = .031) and respiratory distress (15% vs 51%; OR, 0.15; P = .012) were less frequent among case patients. MERS-CoV patients were more likely to have a normal white blood cell count than the control group (82% vs 52%; OR, 4.33; P = .029).

Control of viral replication during acute disease is mediated by infiltrating virus-specific T cells via cytokine secretion and cytolytic activity, however sterile immunity is not achieved and virus persists resulting in chronic neuroinflammation associated with demyelination. CXCR2 is a chemokine receptor that upon binding to specific ligands promotes host defense through recruitment of myeloid cells to the CNS as well as protecting oligodendroglia from cytokine-mediated death in response to MHV infection.

We summarized the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings of the first Korean case of MERS-CoV and analyzed whole-genome sequences of MERS-CoV derived from the patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man developed fever and myalgia 7 days after returning to Korea, following a 10-day trip to the Middle East. Before diagnosis, he visited 4 hospitals, potentially resulting in secondary transmission to 28 patients. On admission to the National Medical Center (day 9, post-onset of clinical illness), he presented with drowsiness, hypoxia, and multiple patchy infiltrations on the chest radiograph. He was intubated (day 12) because of progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and INF-\u03B12a and ribavirin treatment was commenced. The treatment course was prolonged by superimposed ventilator associated pneumonia. MERS-CoV PCR results converted to negative from day 47 and the patient was discharged (day 137), following rehabilitation therapy. The complete genome sequence obtained from a sputum sample (taken on day 11) showed the highest sequence similarity (99.59%) with the virus from an outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in February 2015. CONCLUSIONS: The first case of MERS-CoV infection had high transmissibility and was associated with a severe clinical course. The patient made a successful recovery after early treatment with antiviral agents and adequate supportive care. This first case in South Korea became a super-spreader because of improper infection control measures, rather than variations of the virus.","publish_time":"2017-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Ji Yeon; Kim, You-Jin; Chung, Eun Hee; Kim, Dae-Won; Jeong, Ina; Kim, Yeonjae; Yun, Mi-ran; Kim, Sung Soon; Kim, Gayeon; Joh, Joon-Sung","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e659993cca4cf1cc40900a6625576e8c63013602.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5512736.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-017-2576-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709419/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Medical Center"],"locations":["Middle East","Riyadh","Saudi Arabia","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["CoV infection","day trip","Korean case of MERS","MERS-CoV PCR results","genome sequences of MERS","treatment course","South Korea","CASE PRESENTATION","largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","early treatment","ribavirin treatment","severe clinical course","complete genome sequence","improper infection control measures","post-onset of clinical illness","progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome","highest sequence similarity","antiviral agents","super-spreader","ARDS","multiple patchy infiltrations","successful recovery","year-old man","adequate supportive care","myalgia","INF-\u03B12a","National Medical Center","laboratory findings","sputum sample","high transmissibility","fever","drowsiness","hypoxia","chest radiograph","days","Riyadh","superimposed ventilator","variations","hospitals","secondary transmission","admission","Saudi Arabia","patients","pneumonia","rehabilitation therapy","CONCLUSIONS","diagnosis","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Here we report the cloning and characterization of the cDNA and gene encoding porcine DC-SIGN (pDC-SIGN). The full-length pDC-SIGN cDNA encodes a type II transmembrane protein of 240 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that pDC-SIGN, together with bovine, canis and equine DC-SIGN, are more closely related to mouse SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 than to human DC-SIGN. pDC-SIGN has the same gene structure as bovine, canis DC-SIGN and mouse SIGNR8 with eight exons. pDC-SIGN mRNA expression was detected in pig spleen, thymus, lymph node, lung, bone marrow and muscles. pDC-SIGN protein was found to express on the surface of monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages, lymph node sinusoidal macrophage-like, dendritic-like and endothelial cells but not of monocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes or lymph node lymphocytes. A BHK cell line stably expressing pDC-SIGN binds to human ICAM-3 and ICAM-2 immunoadhesins in a calcium-dependent manner, and enhances the transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to target cells in trans. The results will help better understand the biological role(s) of DC-SIGN family in innate immunity during the evolutionary process.","publish_time":"2008-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Y.W.; Dryman, B.A.; Li, W.; Meng, X.J.","journal":"Dev Comp Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b1bbb4d9b70698a71b99101d3b2c0a8152de9b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103218.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X08002097; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X08002097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18951915/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2008.09.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BHK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human DC-SIGN","pDC-SIGN protein","canis DC-SIGN","porcine DC-SIGN","pDC-SIGN binds","DC-SIGN family","equine DC-SIGN","full-length pDC-SIGN cDNA","pDC-SIGN mRNA expression","lymph node lymphocytes","dendritic cells","human ICAM","lymph node sinusoidal macrophage","bovine","endothelial cells","mouse SIGNR8","human C-type lectin","transmission of porcine reproductive","alveolar macrophages","derived macrophages","gene structure","transmembrane protein","mouse SIGNR7","peripheral blood lymphocytes","pig spleen","respiratory syndrome virus","lung","monocytes","innate immunity","PRRSV","bone marrow","thymus","calcium-dependent manner","immunoadhesins","surface of monocyte","BHK cell line","evolutionary process","amino acids","biological role","muscles","characterization","exons","Phylogenetic analysis","enveloped viruses","cloning","results"],"language":"en"},

Yet despite significant research efforts, approved vaccines or antivirals to combat this pathogen are still lacking. Safe and effective antivirals are not available, particularly for chronically infected immunocompromised individuals, and for prophylactic applications to protect high\u2010risk and vulnerable populations in outbreak settings. Since the discovery of human norovirus in 1972, the lack of a cell culture system has hindered biological research and antiviral studies for many years. Recent breakthroughs in culturing human norovirus have been encouraging, however, further development and optimization of these novel methodologies are required to facilitate more robust replication levels, that will enable reliable serological and replication studies, as well as advances in antiviral development. In the last few years, considerable progress has been made toward the development of norovirus antivirals, inviting an updated review. This review focuses on potential therapeutics that have been reported since 2010, which were examined across at least two model systems used for studying human norovirus or its enzymes. In addition, we have placed emphasis on antiviral compounds with a defined chemical structure. We include a comprehensive outline of direct\u2010acting antivirals and offer a discussion of host\u2010modulating compounds, a rapidly expanding and promising area of antiviral research.","publish_time":"2018-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Netzler, Natalie E.; Enosi Tuipulotu, Daniel; White, Peter A.","journal":"Med Res Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e51d6319d4d82d9d48fbd705497304c5b3792cdc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168425.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/med.21545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584800/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of norovirus antivirals","antiviral development","antiviral compounds","antiviral studies","culturing human norovirus","discovery of human norovirus","acting antivirals","effective antivirals","Human noroviruses","promising area of antiviral research","biological research","significant research efforts","replication studies","years","modulating compounds","updated review","significant health burden","robust replication levels","prophylactic applications","vulnerable populations","approved vaccines","cell culture system","lack","discussion of host","infected immunocompromised individuals","defined chemical structure","outbreak settings","society","comprehensive outline of direct","emphasis","Recent breakthroughs","advances","novel methodologies","estimated deaths","infections","optimization","model systems","considerable progress","potential therapeutics","pathogen","enzymes","addition"],"language":"en"},

Spike glycoprotein (S) of MERS-CoV is a key target for vaccines and therapeutics because S mediates viral entry and membrane-fusion to host cells. Here, four different S subunit proteins, receptor-binding domain (RBD; 358\u2013606 aa), S1 (1\u2013751 aa), S2 (752\u20131296 aa), and S\u0394TM (1\u20131296 aa), were generated using the baculoviral system and immunized in mice to develop neutralizing antibodies. We developed 77 hybridomas and selected five neutralizing mAbs by immunization with S\u0394TM against MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain S-pseudotyped lentivirus. However, all five monoclonal antibodies (mAb) did not neutralize the pseudotyped V534A mutation. Additionally, one mAb RBD-14F8 did not show neutralizing activity against pseudoviruses with amino acid substitution of L506 F or D509 G (England1 strain, EMC/2012 L506 F, and EMC/2012 D509 G), and RBD-43E4 mAb could not neutralize the pseudotyped I529 T mutation, while three other neutralizing mAbs showed broad neutralizing activity. This implies that the mutation in residue 506\u2013509, 529, and 534 of S is critical to generate neutralization escape variants of MERS-CoV. Interestingly, all five neutralizing mAbs have binding affinity to RBD, although most mAbs generated by RBD did not have neutralizing activity. Additionally, chimeric antibodies of RBD-14F8 and RBD-43E4 with human Fc and light chain showed neutralizing effect against wild type MERS-CoV KOR/KNIH/002, similar to the original mouse mAbs.

Self-reported health declaration forms were returned by 355,887 arrivals (61% of the total arrivals). Of these, 608 symptomatic arrivals (0.2%) including 6 febrile arrivals were analyzed. RESULTS: Fever prevalence at an international airport in Korea was 0.002%. Self-reported fever was significantly positively associated with tympanic temperature (p\u003C0.001). The difference between the thermal camera temperature (36.83\u00B0C) and tympanic (or ear) temperature (38.14\u00B0C) was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The findings imply that a procedure for mass detection of fever such as self-reported questionnaires and thermal camera scanning may serve as an effective tool for detecting febrile arrivals at quarantine stations.

The objective of this study was to develop various composite structures of titanium and vanadium oxide (Ti-V-O) coatings on pure titanium through high-temperature annealing and laser texturing oxidation, separately; additionally, surface morphologies, tribological and hydrophilic properties, and antibacterial and biocompatibility abilities of these Ti-V-O coatings were evaluated. TiV alloy thin films were deposited on pure titanium and then annealed to form Ti-V-O coatings through thermal oxidation and laser texturing oxidation. Ball-on-disc wear tests and contact angle tests were conducted to evaluate the tribological properties and wettability of the coatings, respectively. The antibacterial activity of the coatings was estimated by SYTO9 nucleic acid staining with Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria). The cell cytotoxicity of the coatings was analyzed following the ISO 10995-5:2009 standard with human skin fibroblast cells. The Ti-V-O coatings, subjected to annealing at 700 \u00B0C, demonstrated higher hardness (Hv 1171) and a lower friction coefficient (0.6). The highest hardness (Hv 2711) and the lowest friction coefficient (0.52) were obtained for the Ti-V-O after laser surface texturing oxidation at 100 kHz. The oxide coating obtained from 100 kHz laser texturing oxidation exhibited the lotus effect because of its systematic textured microstructures, and displayed superhydrophobic surface properties. Compared with the unannealed TiV coating, both the samples with high-temperature annealing and laser surface texturing oxidation had excellent antibacterial properties to Staphylococcus aureus. However, the Ti-V-O thin films exhibited notable cell cytotoxicity. Although the cell viability on Ti-V-O coatings were not ideal, this study confirmed improvement in surface hardness, tribology, and antibacterial performance in Ti-V-O coatings, which may have potential for use in biomedical tools, devices, and equipment.","publish_time":"2018-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Yin-Yu; Zhang, Jia-Hao; Huang, Heng-Li","journal":"Materials (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6a56489ca7a8d317c3244f06f15cbbc95181fd4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6316979.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ma11122495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30544800/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O coatings","Ti-V","laser surface texturing oxidation","kHz laser texturing oxidation","surface hardness","thermal oxidation","excellent antibacterial properties","surface morphologies","tribological properties","pure titanium","displayed superhydrophobic surface properties","antibacterial performance","hydrophilic properties","antibacterial activity","Titanium dioxide","Staphylococcus aureus","high-temperature","films","Hv","study","oxide coating","higher hardness","highest hardness","notable cell cytotoxicity","cell viability","various composite structures of titanium","unannealed TiV coating","lower friction coefficient","lowest friction coefficient","vanadium oxides","TiV alloy","disc wear tests","contact angle tests","lotus effect","systematic textured microstructures","SYTO9 nucleic acid staining","tribology","biocompatibility abilities","standard","biomedical tools","samples","improvement","potential","Gram-positive bacteria","human skin fibroblast cells","devices","use","equipment","Ball","wettability","medical fields","ISO","objective"],"language":"en"},

To create a novel trial vaccine and evaluate its potency, we attempted to generate a SARS inactivated vaccine using SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain F69 treated with formaldehyde and mixed with Al(OH)3. Three doses of the vaccine were used to challenge three groups of BALB/c mice. We found that the mice exhibited specific IgM on day 4 and IgG on day 8. The peak titers of IgG were at day 47 in low-dose group (1:19,200) and high-dose group (1:38,400) whereas in middle-dose group (1:19,200), the peak was at day 40. On day 63, the IgG levels reached a plateau. Neutralization assay demonstrated that the antisera could protect Vero-E6 cells from SARS-CoV\u0027s infection. Analysis of the antibody specificity revealed that the mouse antisera contained a mixture of antibodies specifically against the structure proteins of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the mouse antisera conferred higher amount of antibodies against protein N, polypeptide S4 and S2 than those of proteins M and 3CL. These findings suggest that the inactivated SARS-CoV could preserve its antigenicity and the inactivated vaccine can stimulate mice to produce high levels of antibodies with neutralization activity. Results also suggest that polypeptides originating from protein N or S might be a potential target for the generation of a recombinant SARS vaccine.","publish_time":"2004-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Sheng; Wang, Yi-Fei; Zhang, Mei-Ying; Liu, Xin-Jian; Zhang, Chuan-Hai; Liu, Shi-Sheng; Qian, Chui-Wen; Li, Jiu-Xiang; Lu, Jia-Hai; Wan, Zhuo-Yue; Zheng, Huan-Yin; Yan, Xin-Ge; Meng, Min-Jie; Fan, Jiang-lin","journal":"Immunology Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f953604a06ea594d767cab663c06310c128a8e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112924.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247804001749; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247804001749","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS inactivated vaccine","day","inactivated SARS-CoV","recombinant SARS vaccine","SARS coronavirus","structure proteins of SARS","SARS-CoV\u0027s infection","high-dose group","mouse antisera","IgG levels","high levels of antibodies","novel trial vaccine","low-dose group","middle-dose group","mixture of antibodies","protein N","c mice","peak titers of IgG","neutralization activity","Neutralization assay","polypeptide S4","serious infectious threat","Vero-E6 cells","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","formaldehyde","S2","generation","strain F69","public health","potential target","polypeptides","antibody specificity","specific IgM","antigenicity","groups of BALB","potency","OH","Analysis","plateau","findings","Results","doses"],"language":"en"},

Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A \u03B2-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection. Neither are macrolides indicated as first-line therapy; they should be reserved for patients allergic to penicillin. The appropriate diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and proper use of antibiotics based on the scientific evidence available are crucial.

For both hemiacetals oxyanion formation occurs with a pK(a) value of ~ 7 showing that chymotrypsin reduces the oxyanion pK(a) values by ~ 5.6 pK(a) units and stabilizes the oxyanions of both diastereoisomers by ~ 32 kJ mol(\u2212 1). As pH has only a small effect on binding we conclude that oxyanion formation does not have a significant effect on binding the aldehyde inhibitor. By comparing the binding of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO with that of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-H we estimate that the aldehyde group increases binding ~ 100 fold. At pH 7.2 the effective molarity of the active site serine hydroxy group is ~ 6000 which is ~ 7 \u00D7 less effective than with the corresponding glyoxal inhibitor.

In this study, four full-length bat AAV capsid genes were isolated in China, with their amino acid sequences sharing 61% identity with those of AAV2 on average. These capsid genes could package AAV particles in combination with AAV2 rep and ITRs, albeit at a lower efficiency. Bat AAVs could only slightly infect mouse liver but could transduce mouse muscle to some extent after systemic administration with a higher muscle/liver ratio than that of primate AAVs. Bat AAV 10HB showed moderate muscle transduction, similar to that of AAV2, during direct intramuscular injection and, compared with other AAV serotypes, was also relatively efficient in resisting human antibody neutralization after intramuscular injection. Evolutionary analysis revealed a number of codons in bat AAV capsid genes subject to positive selection, with sites corresponding to V259 and N691 in 10HB capsids being localized on the surface of the AAV2 capsid. Mutagenesis studies indicated that the positive selection in bat AAV capsids is driven by their tropism evolution in host species.

However, its ability to induce the type I interferon (IFN) response has not yet been characterized. Here, we demonstrate that \u03B3-PGA induces type I IFN signaling pathway via the TLR4 signaling pathway. The induction required both myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) and the pattern-recognition receptor CD14, which are two TLR4-associated accessory proteins. The \u03B3-PGA with high molecular weights (2000 and 5000 kDa) was able to activate the subsequent signals through TLR4/MD2 to result in dimerization of IRF-3, a transcription factor required for IFN gene expression, leading to increases in mRNA levels of the type I IFN-response genes, 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 OAS and ISG56. Moreover, \u03B3-PGA (2000 kDa) displayed an antiviral activity against SARS coronavirus and hepatitis C virus. Our results identify high-molecular weight \u03B3-PGA as a TLR4 ligand and demonstrate that \u03B3-PGA requires both CD14 and MD2 for the activation of type I IFN responses. Our results suggest that the microbial biopolymer \u03B3-PGA may have therapeutic potential against a broad range of viruses sensitive to type I IFNs.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Wooseong; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Ahn, Dae-Gyun; Cho, Hee; Sung, Moon-Hee; Han, Seung Hyun; Oh, Jong-Won","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ff20c92bf922c29658e1bd1823ac067e810235f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112489.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24016850/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961213010302; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.067; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961213010302","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","OAS","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microbial biopolymer \u03B3-PGA","high-molecular weight \u03B3-PGA","Abstract Poly-\u03B3","MD2","IFN responses","TLR4 ligand","activation of type","IFN-response genes","IFN gene expression","kDa","results","pathway","high molecular weights","transcription factor","pattern-recognition receptor CD14","myeloid differentiation factor","SARS coronavirus","therapeutic potential","glutamic acid","antiviral activity","hepatitis C virus","toll","broad range of viruses sensitive","interactions","subsequent signals","interferon","dimerization of IRF","anionic polypeptide","mRNA levels","immune cells","induction","Bacillus","IFNs","accessory proteins","ability","OAS","ISG56"],"language":"en"},

To facilitate the design of biosensors for infectious organisms in commercial aircraft, we characterized bacterial diversity in aircraft air. Samples from 61 aircraft high\u2010efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters were analyzed with a custom microarray of 16S rRNA gene sequences (PhyloChip), representing bacterial lineages. A total of 606 subfamilies from 41 phyla were detected. The most abundant bacterial subfamilies included bacteria associated with humans, especially skin, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and with water and soil habitats. Operational taxonomic units that contain important human pathogens as well as their close, more benign relatives were detected. When compared to 43 samples of urban outdoor air, aircraft samples differed in composition, with higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria lineages in aircraft samples, and higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria lineages in outdoor air samples. In addition, aircraft and outdoor air samples differed in the incidence of taxa containing human pathogens. Overall, these results demonstrate that HEPA filter samples can be used to deeply characterize bacterial diversity in aircraft air and suggest that the presence of close relatives of certain pathogens must be taken into account in probe design for aircraft biosensors. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: A biosensor that could be deployed in commercial aircraft would be required to function at an extremely low false alarm rate, making an understanding of microbial background important. This study reveals a diverse bacterial background present on aircraft, including bacteria closely related to pathogens of public health concern. Furthermore, this aircraft background is different from outdoor air, suggesting different probes may be needed to detect airborne contaminants to achieve minimal false alarm rates. This study also indicates that aircraft HEPA filters could be used with other molecular techniques to further characterize background bacteria and in investigations in the wake of a disease outbreak.","publish_time":"2012-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Korves, T.

A macroscopic spatial analysis of HCV infection that can provide scientific information for further intervention and disease control is lacking. METHODS: All geo-referenced HCV cases that had been recorded by the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) during 2005\u20132011 were included in the study. In order to learn about the changes of demographic characteristics and geographic distribution, trend test and spatial analysis were conducted to reflect the changing pattern of HCV infection. RESULTS: Over 770,000 identified HCV infection cases had specific geographic information during the study period (2005\u20132011). Ratios of gender (Male/Female, Z-value = \u221218.53, P\u003C0.001), age group (\u226430 years old/\u226531 years old, Z-value = \u221251.03, P\u003C0.001) and diagnosis type (Clinical diagnosis/Laboratory diagnosis, Z-value = \u2212130.47, P\u003C0.001) declined.

The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Tianmu; Rui, Jia; Wang, Qiupeng; Zhao, Zeyu; Cui, Jing-An; Yin, Ling","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b97ae01484ff19cd537dc3cd5776a253d06481f6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8b88d01563538e4abd29c3ba493c534af30664cc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.19.911669","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Reservoir-People transmission network model","Reservoir network","potential transmission","RP model","Bats-Hosts","nCoV","infection source","human infection","causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology","novel coronavirus","Chinese authorities","R0","World Health Organization","probable","seafood market","basic reproduction number","public concerns","transmissibility","study"],"language":"en"},

The host-constrained perception of viruses implies preference of genetic exchange between viruses and cellular organisms of their host superkingdoms and viral origins from host cells either via escape or reduction. However, viruses frequently establish non-lytic interactions with organisms and endogenize into the genomes of bacterial endosymbionts that reside in eukaryotic cells. Such interactions create opportunities for genetic exchange between viruses and organisms of non-host superkingdoms. Here, we take an atypical approach to revisit virus-cell interactions by first identifying protein fold structures in the proteomes of archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses and second by tracing their spread in the proteomes of superkingdoms Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The exercise quantified protein structural homologies between viruses and organisms of their host and non-host superkingdoms and revealed likely candidates for virus-to-cell and cell-to-virus gene transfers. Unexpected lifestyle-driven genetic affiliations between bacterioviruses and Eukarya and eukaryoviruses and Bacteria were also predicted in addition to a large cohort of protein folds that were universally shared by viral and cellular proteomes and virus-specific protein folds not detected in cellular proteomes. These protein folds provide unique insights into viral origins and evolution that are generally difficult to recover with traditional sequence alignment-dependent evolutionary analyses owing to the fast mutation rates of viral gene sequences.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malik, Shahana S.; Azem-e-Zahra, Syeda; Kim, Kyung Mo; Caetano-Anoll\u00E9s, Gustavo; Nasir, Arshan","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c9a3072e8533ac8c5a74abfc595966d516a7878.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5671483.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29163404/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02110","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["organisms of non-host superkingdoms","host cells","infected host","host-constrained perception of viruses","cellular organisms","cellular proteomes","virus-specific protein folds","viral origins","proteomes of superkingdoms Archaea","proteomes of archaeoviruses","bacterioviruses","eukaryoviruses","revisit virus-cell interactions","large cohort of protein folds","protein fold structures","non-lytic interactions","virus gene transfers","preference of genetic exchange","genetic affiliations","Eukarya","exercise quantified protein structural homologies","fast mutation rates of viral gene sequences","eukaryotic cells","traditional sequence alignment-dependent evolutionary analyses","unique insights","likely candidates","atypical approach","addition","escape","spread","opportunities","genomes of bacterial endosymbionts","Unexpected lifestyle","reduction","taxonomy"],"language":"en"},

(2) Methods: The host entry machinery required for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was examined for the gene expression profiles and polymorphism. (3) Results: Lung, kidney, small intestine, and salivary glands were among the tissues which expressed the entry machinery coding genes Ace2, Tmprss2, CtsB, and CtsL. The genes had no significant expression changes between males and females. The four human population groups of Europeans, Africans, Asians, and Americans had specific and also a common pool of rare variants for the X-linked locus of ACE2 receptor. Several specific and common ACE2 variants including S19P, I21T/V, E23K, A25T, K26R, T27A, E35D/K, E37K, Y50F, N51D/S, M62V, N64K, K68E, F72V, E75G, M82I, T92I, Q102P, G220S, H239Q, G326E, E329G, G352V, D355N, H378R, Q388L, P389H, E467K, H505R, R514G/*, and Y515C were of the utmost importance to the viral entry and infection.

Most interestingly, the analyses revealed that more than half of the variants can exist in males, i.e., as hemizygous. (4) Conclusions: The rare variants of human ACE2 seem to be one of the determinant factors associated with fitness in the battle against SARS viruses. The hemizygous viral-entry booster variants of ACE2 describe the higher SARS-CoV-2 mortality rate in males. This is also supported by the lack of gender bias for the gene expression profiles of entry machinery.

ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia. Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.","publish_time":"2020-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, M L; Yang, J M; Sun, Y P; Su, G H","journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32061198/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II"],"organizations":["ACE/Ang II","RAS","ACEI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ang","RAS system","human ACE2","exhaustion of ACE2","symptoms of acute severe pneumonia","exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia","RAS inhibitors","binding of COVID","AT1R pathway","Mas receptor pathway","AT1R inhibitors","infected patients","multi-system inflammation","Increased ACE","mortality rate","poor prognostic factors","respiratory failure","condition of controlling blood pressure","pulmonary inflammatory response","effective treatment","Animal studies","important role","imbalance","novel coronavirus","ACEI","present"],"language":"en"},

Our fundamental view of the nature of a vaccine was changed with the discovery of DNA immunization in the early 1990s when it was determined that the genetic material that encodes for antigens, rather than the actual antigens themselves, can be effective in eliciting an immune response. Given the ever increasing threat of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases and a renewed concern regarding the use of biological agents for bioterrorism purposes, the opportunities that DNA vaccine technology provides could not have come at a more critical time in history. Since its inception, DNA vaccination technology has undergone significant advancements and many candidate human vaccine formulations have already been developed. Improved modes of administration, the use of codon and antigen gene optimization, and the implementation of vaccination DNA prime/boost regimens have led to the quick progression of DNA vaccines from research laboratory benches to human clinical trials. Significant progress has been made in developing DNA vaccines against various biodefense and emerging infectious disease targets, such as HIV-1, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola, the viral encephalitides, anthrax, plague, and botulism, among others with some already moving into early phase clinical trials with promising results.

The evidence for increased transmission of infectious diseases at international sporting mass gatherings that attract many visitors from all over the world is not clear, and the evidence base for public health surveillance, epidemiology, and response at events such as the Olympics is small. However, infectious diseases are a recognised risk, and public health planning is, and should remain, a crucial part of the overall planning of sporting events. In this Series paper, we set out the planning and the surveillance systems that were used to monitor public health risks during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in the summer of 2012, and draw attention to the public health issues\u2014infectious diseases and chemical, radiation, and environmental hazards\u2014that arose. Although the absolute risk of health-protection problems, including infectious diseases, at sporting mass gatherings is small, the need for reassurance of the absence of problems is higher than has previously been considered; this could challenge conventional public health surveillance systems. Recognition of the limitations of health-surveillance systems needs to be part of the planning for future sporting events.","publish_time":"2014-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCloskey, Brian; Endericks, Tina; Catchpole, Mike; Zambon, Maria; McLauchlin, Jim; Shetty, Nandini; Manuel, Rohini; Turbitt, Deborah; Smith, Gillian; Crook, Paul; Severi, Ettore; Jones, Jane; Ibbotson, Sue; Marshall, Roberta; Smallwood, Catherine A H; Isla, Nicolas; Memish, Ziad A; Al-Rabeeah, Abdullah A; Barbeschi, Maurizio; Heymann, David L; Zumla, Alimuddin","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/265d4ef0216be4043c6760f232290970568438c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138022.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857700/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673613623429; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62342-9; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673613623429","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health planning","public health risks","public health issues","limitations of health","conventional public health surveillance systems","absolute risk of health","health system of countries","increased transmission of infectious diseases","overall planning of sporting events","international sporting mass gatherings","future sporting events","potential risks","recognised risk","protection problems","evidence base","absence of problems","London","epidemiology","need","radiation","response","summer","Paralympic Games","reassurance","attention","visitors","environmental hazards","Olympics","world","Recognition","Series paper"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 requires the collaboration of nearly 200 countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while gaining time to explore and improve treatment options especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and immunocompromised patients, who appear to be at high-risk to die from cardiopulmonary failure. Currently unanswered questions are why elderly people, particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities seem to exhibit higher mortality rates after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether intensive care becomes indispensable for these patients to prevent multi-organ failure and sudden death. To face these challenges, we here summarize the molecular insights into viral infection mechanisms and implications for cardiovascular disease. Since the infection starts in the upper respiratory system, first flu-like symptoms develop that spread throughout the body. The wide range of affected organs is presumably based on the common expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry-receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Physiologically, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II, the master regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thereby converting it into vasodilatory molecules, which have well-documented cardio-protective effects. Thus, RAAS inhibitors, which may increase the expression levels of ACE2, are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and CVD. This, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2 for cell-entry, have spurred controversial discussions on the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we highlight the state-of-the-art knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-dependent mechanisms and the potential interaction with ACE2 expression and cell surface localization. We aim to provide a list of potential treatment options and a better understanding of why CVD is a high risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and further discuss the acute as well as long-term cardiac consequences.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gro\u00DF, Sonja; Jahn, Christopher; Cushman, Sarah; B\u00E4r, Christian; Thum, Thomas","journal":"J Mol Cell Cardiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4a830d87a06bbb09c0ba54fea40db2ca7420e7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191280.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022282820301218?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2020.04.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022282820301218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360703/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 expression","major SARS-CoV","hijacks ACE2","role of ACE2","spread of SARS","expression levels of ACE2","CVD","current COVID","viral infection mechanisms","cell-entry","cardiovascular disease","entry-receptor angiotensin","renin-angiotensin","list of potential treatment options","common expression","immunocompromised patients","treatment of hypertension","potential interaction","dependent mechanisms","aldosterone system","cardiopulmonary failure","RAAS inhibitors","cell surface localization","multi-organ failure","upper respiratory system","implications","higher mortality rates","better understanding","well-documented cardio-protective effects","pre-existing comorbidities","molecular insights","high risk factor","elderly people","controversial discussions","intensive care","master regulator","flu","sudden death","susceptibility","state-of-the-art knowledge","enzyme","vasodilatory molecules","wide range of affected organs","long-term cardiac consequences","unanswered questions","symptoms","pandemic","countries","time","world","alarming update","review","months","collaboration","parts","body","challenges"],"language":"en"},

It can be triggered by ambient microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. In this review, we examine the outcomes of asthma patients in relation to environmental exposures to ambient microbe products, focusing on whether exposure leads to asthma development from birth to childhood and if particular microbes are associated with worsened asthma exacerbations. RECENT FINDINGS: Bacterial endotoxin is more prominent in homes with pets and may cause cytokine cascades that lead to asthma exacerbation. However, some studies have demonstrated a protective effect with early exposure. Patients with positive Aspergillus skin testing are more prone to moderate-severe or severe-uncontrolled asthma. Fungal sensitization is also associated with earlier onset of asthma and demonstrates a dose-dependent relationship of symptom severity and duration. Among viruses, rhinovirus has the greatest association with decreased lung function, severe asthma, and asthma-related hospital admissions. Distribution of microbial products and associated asthma symptoms depends on the geographical climate. Genetic variations among individuals also mitigate the effects of microbial products on asthma development and symptom severity. SUMMARY: Microbial products of bacteria, fungi, and viruses are associated with the development of asthma, more severe asthma symptoms, and worse outcomes. However, some early exposure studies have also demonstrated a protective effect. Bacterial and fungal products are related to decreased lung function and earlier onset of asthma. Viral products are related to asthma-associated hospital admissions; and the climate and patient genetics can also temper or intensify the relationships between microbial products, asthma development, and asthma symptom severity. Further research should focus on the effects of early microbe exposure and its interaction with human immune systems and asthma-related outcomes.","publish_time":"2019-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Howard, Evin; Orhurhu, Vwaire; Huang, Lisa; Guthrie, Barbara; Phipatanakul, Wanda","journal":"Curr Allergy Asthma Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5562c2dfbebce46e0c95827c8840ad0b861666e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088961.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11882-019-0890-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma development","development of asthma","associated asthma symptoms","asthma-related outcomes","severe asthma symptoms","asthma symptom severity","severe-uncontrolled asthma","outcomes of asthma patients","earlier onset of asthma","asthma-associated hospital admissions","worsened asthma exacerbations","asthma-related hospital admissions","fungal products","effects of microbial products","Microbial products of bacteria","Distribution of microbial products","Viral products","ambient microbe products","early exposure studies","viruses","effects of early microbe exposure","moderate-severe","decreased lung function","individuals","ambient microbes","worse outcomes","protective effect","fungi","dose-dependent relationship of symptom severity","particular microbes","Bacterial endotoxin","geographical climate","Fungal sensitization","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","long-term treatments","interaction","environmental exposures","chronic respiratory condition","acute emergency room","human immune systems","greatest association","high costs","worldwide prevalence","birth","positive Aspergillus skin testing","homes","healthcare system","childhood","cytokine cascades","pets","visits","rhinovirus","duration","relationships","RECENT FINDINGS","SUMMARY","patient genetics","Genetic variations","research"],"language":"en"},

Although MERS-CoV infection is ubiquitous in dromedaries across Africa as well as in the Arabian Peninsula, zoonotic disease appears confined to the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoVs from Africa have hitherto been poorly studied. We genetically and phenotypically characterized MERS-CoV from dromedaries sampled in Morocco, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. Viruses from Africa (clade C) are phylogenetically distinct from contemporary viruses from the Arabian Peninsula (clades A and B) but remain antigenically similar in microneutralization tests. Viruses from West (Nigeria, Burkina Faso) and North (Morocco) Africa form a subclade, C1, that shares clade-defining genetic signatures including deletions in the accessory gene ORF4b. Compared with human and camel MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia, virus isolates from Burkina Faso (BF785) and Nigeria (Nig1657) had lower virus replication competence in Calu-3 cells and in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. BF785 replicated to lower titer in lungs of human DPP4-transduced mice. A reverse genetics-derived recombinant MERS-CoV (EMC) lacking ORF4b elicited higher type I and III IFN responses than the isogenic EMC virus in Calu-3 cells. However, ORF4b deletions may not be the major determinant of the reduced replication competence of BF785 and Nig1657. Genetic and phenotypic differences in West African viruses may be relevant to zoonotic potential. There is an urgent need for studies of MERS-CoV at the animal\u2013human interface.","publish_time":"2018-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Daniel K. W.; Hui, Kenrie P. Y.; Perera, Ranawaka A. P.

To better inform programmes and policies focused on preventing and treating LRIs, we assessed the contributions and patterns of risk factor attribution, intervention coverage, and sociodemographic development in 195 countries and territories by drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) LRI estimates. METHODS: We used four strategies to model LRI burden: the mortality due to LRIs was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive ensemble modelling tool; the incidence of LRIs was modelled using population representative surveys, health-care utilisation data, and scientific literature in a compartmental meta-regression tool; the attribution of risk factors for LRI mortality was modelled in a counterfactual framework; and trends in LRI mortality were analysed applying changes in exposure to risk factors over time. In GBD, infectious disease mortality, including that due to LRI, is among HIV-negative individuals. We categorised locations based on their burden in 1990 to make comparisons in the changing burden between 1990 and 2017 and evaluate the relative percent change in mortality rate, incidence, and risk factor exposure to explain differences in the health loss associated with LRIs among children younger than 5 years. FINDINGS: In 2017, LRIs caused 808 920 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 747 286\u2013873 591) in children younger than 5 years. Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (from 2 337 538 to 808 920 deaths; 65\u00B74% decrease, 61\u00B75\u201368\u00B75) and in mortality rate (from 362\u00B77 deaths [330\u00B71\u2013392\u00B70] per 100 000 children to 118\u00B79 deaths [109\u00B78\u2013128\u00B73] per 100 000 children; 67\u00B72% decrease, 63\u00B75\u201370\u00B71). LRI incidence declined globally (32\u00B74% decrease, 27\u00B72\u201337\u00B75). The percent change in under-5 mortality rate and incidence has varied across locations. Among the risk factors assessed in this study, those responsible for the greatest decrease in under-5 LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017 were increased coverage of vaccination against Haemophilus influenza type b (11\u00B74% decrease, 0\u00B70\u201324\u00B75), increased pneumococcal vaccine coverage (6\u00B73% decrease, 6\u00B71\u20136\u00B73), and reductions in household air pollution (8\u00B74%, 6\u00B78\u20139\u00B72). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that there have been substantial but uneven declines in LRI mortality among countries between 1990 and 2017. Although improvements in indicators of sociodemographic development could explain some of these trends, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors are related to the rates of decline in LRI mortality. No single intervention would universally accelerate reductions in health loss associated with LRIs in all settings, but emphasising the most dominant risk factors, particularly in countries with high case fatality, can contribute to the reduction of preventable deaths.

However, two atypical Escherichia coli colony types are isolated consistently from moribund and dead poults afflicted with PEMS. To test the infectivity of these E. coli strains, poults were placed into floor pens in three isolation treatment rooms: 1) Control: no bacterial challenge, 2) E. coli colony Types 1 or 2 posthatch oral challenge: 10(8) cfu/per poult at 1 d, and 3) E. coli colony Types 1 or 2 posthatch oral challenge: 10(8) cfu/per poult at 6 d. Daily intramuscular injections of cyclophosphamide (100 micrograms per poult) from 1 to 5 d posthatch were given to half of the poults in each treatment. Atypical E. coli challenge caused BW depression, and cyclophosphamide treatment exacerbated the response. All E. coli-challenged poults developed diarrhea similar to PEMS. Mortality was increased by both atypical E. coli colony types, but at 21 d E. coli colony Type 2 caused greater mortality than colony Type 1. With cyclophosphamide treatment, mortality was exacerbated with both colony types, but colony Type 2 at 1 d caused the greatest mortality. Ultrastructural damage to ileum epithelium cell microvilli and subcellular organelles indicated that part of the BW depression could be attributed to malabsorption of nutrients. It was concluded that the atypical E. coli colony Types 1 and 2 play a significant role in the PEMS disease.","publish_time":"1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edens, FW; Parkhurst, CR; Qureshi, MA; Casas, IA; Havenstein, GB","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f0e78146330cf7248da9bc299090467d7876d6f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119406354; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119406354","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["Poult Enteritis and Mortality Syndrome","PEMS","d.

Fifty-three percent of children had a prior history of wheeze, 32% had other preexisting medical comorbidities, and 15% were previously healthy. Ten children (29%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. The presence of complex medical conditions (excluding wheezing) (P = 0.03) and copathogens was associated with PICU admission (P = 0.02). Conclusions.

In response to CDC reports, Public Health Ontario Laboratories (PHOL) launched an investigation of patients being tested for enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) in Ontario, Canada. The purpose of this investigation was to enhance our understanding of EV-D68 epidemiology and clinical features. Data for this study included specimens submitted for EV-D68 testing at PHOL from September 1, 2014 to October 31, 2014. Comparisons were made between patients who tested positive for the virus (cases) and those testing negative (controls). EV-D68 was identified in 153/907 (16.8%) of patients tested. In the logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, setting and time to specimen collection, individuals younger than 20 years of age were more likely to be diagnosed with EV-D68 compared to those 20 and over, with peak positivity at ages 5\u20139 years. Cases were not more likely to be hospitalized than controls. Cases were more likely to be identified in September than October (OR 8.07; 95% CI 5.15 to 12.64). Routine viral culture and multiplex PCR were inadequate methods to identify EV-D68 due to poor sensitivity and inability to differentiate EV-D68 from other enterovirus serotypes or rhinovirus. Testing for EV-D68 in Ontario from July to December, 2014 detected the presence of EV-D68 virus among young children during September-October, 2014, with most cases detected in September. There was no difference in hospitalization status between cases and controls. In order to better understand the epidemiology of this virus, surveillance for EV-D68 should include testing of symptomatic individuals from all treatment settings and patient age groups, with collection and analysis of comprehensive clinical and epidemiological data.","publish_time":"2015-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peci, Adriana; Winter, Anne-Luise; Warshawsky, Bryna; Booth, Tim F.; Eshaghi, AliReza; Li, Aimin; Perusini, Stephen; Olsha, Romy; Marchand-Austin, Alex; Kristjanson, Erik; Gubbay, Jonathan B.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90f28a7925b8350d3a484cac6ed454a328d08b67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4658075.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26599365/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","CDC","Public Health Ontario Laboratories"],"locations":["Kansas City","Missouri","Illinois","Ontario","Canada"],"keyphrases":["EV-D68 testing","D68 virus","D68 epidemiology","understanding of EV","presence of EV","cases","investigation of patients","controls","years of age","testing negative","testing of symptomatic individuals","PHOL","increased numbers of pediatric patients","patient age groups","CDC reports","individuals younger","Public Health Ontario Laboratories","specimen collection","clinical features","enterovirus serotypes","enterovirus D","epidemiological data","analysis of comprehensive clinical","multiplex PCR","treatment settings","inadequate methods","Missouri","Illinois","Prevention","time","Kansas City","severe respiratory illness","Centers","Chicago","Routine viral culture","Disease Control","sex","inability","poor sensitivity","specimens","children\u2019s hospitals","response","hospitalization status","young children","surveillance","logistic regression model","SRI","ages","difference","study","rhinovirus","peak positivity","Canada","purpose","order","Comparisons"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We conducted a survey of 49 clinical laboratories in medical institutions and referral medical laboratories. A short questionnaire to survey clinical laboratory practices relating to MERS-CoV diagnostic testing was sent by email to the directors and clinical pathologists in charge of the clinical laboratories performing MERS-CoV testing. The survey focused on testing volume, reporting of results, resources, and laboratory safety. RESULTS: A total of 40 clinical laboratories responded to the survey. A total of 27,009 MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) tests were performed. Most of the specimens were sputum (73.5%). The median turnaround time (TAT) was 5.29 hr (first and third quartile, 4.11 and 7.48 hr) in 26 medical institutions. The median TAT of more than a half of the laboratories (57.7%) was less than 6 hr. Many laboratories were able to perform tests throughout the whole week. Laboratory biosafety preparedness included class II biosafety cabinets (100%); separated pre-PCR, PCR, and post-PCR rooms (88.6%); negative pressure pretreatment rooms (48.6%); and negative pressure sputum collection rooms (20.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical laboratories were able to quickly expand their diagnostic capacity in response to the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak. Our results show that clinical laboratories play an important role in the maintenance and enhancement of laboratory response in preparation for future emerging infections.","publish_time":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Mi-Kyung; Kim, Sinyoung; Kim, Mi-Na; Kweon, Oh Joo; Lim, Yong Kwan; Ki, Chang-Seok; Kim, Jae-Seok; Seong, Moon-Woo; Sung, Heungsup; Yong, Dongeun; Lee, Hyukmin; Choi, Jong-Rak; Kim, Jeong-Ho","journal":"Ann Lab Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6db877f61327ae24341591d620abda3793639462.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4713849.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3343/alm.2016.36.2.154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26709263/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TAT"],"locations":["Middle East","Republic"],"keyphrases":["clinical laboratories","clinical pathologists","MERS-CoV testing","MERS-CoV outbreak","referral medical laboratories","survey","MERS-CoV diagnostic testing","current status of clinical laboratory practices","MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcription PCR","rRT-PCR","pre-PCR","laboratory safety","post-PCR rooms","results","enhancement of laboratory response","Laboratory biosafety preparedness","medical institutions","future emerging infections","testing volume","negative pressure pretreatment rooms","negative pressure sputum collection rooms","hr","tests","total","median TAT","biosafety cabinets","future emerging infectious diseases","diagnostic capacity","median turnaround time","largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","preparation","email","charge","maintenance","class","important role","Republic of Korea","directors","resources","short questionnaire","half","CONCLUSIONS","quartile","BACKGROUND","specimens","week","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This price effect followed the economic law of demand, with Relatively Inelastic Demand (\u22120.758), outweighing indicators of \u2018quality\u2019 such as body coloration, and conservation status. We identify two areas of concern: those larger, slower-breeding, rarer species, even though sold at lower numbers, may be at conservation risk if harvested from the wild.

Methods The promoter 1.8kb of CXCL-10 was sequenced in 24 healthy Chinese individuals to identify genetic polymorphisms. Three tagging SNPs in CXCL-10 promoter (\u22121447A\u003EG, \u2212872G\u003EA, \u2212135G\u003EA) were selected, and genotyping were performed in 240 TB patients and 176 healthy Chinese subjects. Disease associations were examined by \u03C7 2 and Fisher exact test. Results A promoter SNP (\u2212135G\u003EA) with minor allele frequency of 0.1 showed a moderate association with TB both in genotype analysis (p=0.01) and allelic analysis (p=0.03); other tagging SNPs (\u22121447A\u003EG, \u2212872G\u003EA) were not associated with TB. The odd ratio of the protective allele \u2212135G\u003EA was 0.51(C.I 0.29 \u22120.91) for homozygotes and heterozygotes carriers of the A allele. Conclusion A new potential protective SNP (\u2212135G\u003EA) for TB is identified in the promoter of chemokine gene, CXCL-10. Interestingly, the exact same allele has been shown to enhance IP-10 transactivation and susceptibility to Hepatitis B virus infection in a recent publication. This SNP, located at 14bp upstream of a NF-kB binding site, might also account for the susceptibility to TB. Our results expanded the clinical significance of this SNP in CXCL-10 promoter.","publish_time":"2009-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Nelson Leung-Sang; Fan, Harris Pok Yin; Chang, Kwok Chiu; Ching, Jasmine Kuk Lai; Kong, Kathy Pui Shan; Yew, Wing Wai; Kam, Kai Man; Leung, Chi Chiu; Tam, Cheuk Ming; Blackwell, Jenefer; Chan, Chiu Yeung","journal":"Clinica Chimica Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e76fbdf0b963b2d64be8d947669385bee7505ea2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124215.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19523460/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2009.06.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898109003167; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898109003167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["promoter SNP","promoter variants of CXCL","activation of CXCL","TB patients","protective allele","promoter of chemokine gene","chemokines","new potential protective SNP","susceptibility","minor allele frequency","tagging SNPs","results","healthy Chinese individuals","healthy Chinese subjects","genotype analysis","allelic analysis","Fisher exact test","Hepatitis B virus infection","components of innate immune response","respiratory tract pathogens","transactivation","moderate association","recent publication","Abstract Background Previous studies","genetic polymorphisms","Conclusion","role","clinical significance","infectious diseases","heterozygotes carriers","predisposition","tuberculosis","IP","odd ratio","binding site","homozygotes","Disease associations","bp","genotyping","Methods"],"language":"en"},

ABs are produced during a viable but non-infectious developmental state termed \u201Cpersistence\u201D or \u201Cchlamydial stress.\u201D As persistent/stressed chlamydiae: (i) may contribute to chronic inflammation observed in diseases like trachoma; and (ii) are more resistant to current anti-chlamydial drugs of choice, it is critical to better understand this developmental stage. We previously demonstrated that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) co-infection induced Chlamydia pecorum persistence/stress in culture. One critical characteristic of persistence/stress is that the chlamydiae remain viable and can reenter the normal developmental cycle when the stressor is removed. Thus, we hypothesized that PEDV-induced persistence would be reversible if viral replication was inhibited. Therefore, we performed time course experiments in which Vero cells were C. pecorum/PEDV infected in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), which inhibits viral but not chlamydial protein synthesis. CHX-exposure inhibited PEDV replication, but did not inhibit induction of C. pecorum persistence at 24 h post-PEDV infection, as indicated by AB formation and reduced production of infectious EBs. Interestingly, production of infectious EBs resumed when CHX-exposed, co-infected cells were incubated 48\u201372 h post-PEDV co-infection. These data demonstrate that PEDV co-infection-induced chlamydial persistence/stress is reversible and suggest that this induction (i) does not require viral replication in host cells; and (ii) does not require de novo host or viral protein synthesis. These data also suggest that viral binding and/or entry may be required for this effect. Because the PEDV host cell receptor (CD13 or aminopeptidase N) stimulates cellular signaling pathways in the absence of PEDV infection, we suspect that PEDV co-infection might alter CD13 function and induce the chlamydiae to enter the persistent state.","publish_time":"2014-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schoborg, Robert V.; Borel, Nicole","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/879b0904d411e88c1be90f0660e7bb4377ae29d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3952398.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2014.00020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AB","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV-induced persistence","absence of PEDV infection","h post-PEDV infection","h post-PEDV co-infection","chlamydial persistence","site of infection","chlamydial stress","viral replication","CHX-exposure inhibited PEDV replication","PEDV host cell receptor","Chlamydia pecorum persistence","co-infected cells","critical characteristic of persistence","host cells","viral protein synthesis","viral binding","chlamydial protein synthesis","stressed chlamydiae","Vero cells","novo host","non-infectious developmental state","developmental stage","persistent state","data","induction of","reduced production of infectious EBs","normal developmental cycle","current anti-chlamydial drugs of choice","CD13 function","AB formation","aminopeptidase N","pathways","alternative replicative form","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","aberrant body","time course experiments","culture","presence of cycloheximide","chronic inflammation","diseases","trachoma","stressor","entry","effect"],"language":"en"},

PHEV mainly causes two types of clinical manifestations representing vomiting and wasting and encephalomyelitis in piglets. However, our recent findings provide strong evidence that PHEV can also cause respiratory disease in older pigs. Genomic analysis of new PHEV strains identified in our former study further classifies PHEV into three genotypes. Detection and differentiation of these new mutants are critical in monitoring PHEV evolution in the field. In the present study, we report the development of a triplex real-time RT-PCR assay for detection and differentiation of three PHEV genotypes, 1, 2, and 3. Three sets of primers and probes were designed; one set of primers and probe targeting the conserved regions of the 3\u2032 end nucleocapsid for detection of all three genotypes and another two sets of primers and probes targeting the regions of NS2 with different patterns of deletions for detection of both genotypes 1 and 3, or genotype 3 only. Genotype 1 was positive when two probe dyes showed signals, genotype 2 was positive when only one probe dye showed a signal, and genotype 3 was positive when all three probes showed signals. The detection limit of the developed triplex real-time RT-PCR was as low as 8 or 9 DNA copies for three sets of primers and probes. The specificity test showed no cross reaction with other porcine viruses. Positive field-samples were correctly typed by this new assay, which was further confirmed by DNA sequencing. The triplex real-time RT-PCR provides a rapid and sensitive method to detect and differentiate all three US genotypes of PHEV from clinical samples.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Leyi; Eggett, Therese E.; Lanka, Saraswathi; Fredrickson, Richard L.; Li, Ganwu; Zhang, Yan; Yoo, Dongwan; Bowman, Andrew S.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ede80834eb9dc55288abf9e7ee3c798ae28c3f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113741.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093419300643; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959064/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093419300643","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PHEV genotypes","US genotypes of PHEV","probes","sets of primers","monitoring PHEV evolution","detection limit","Positive field-samples","triplex real-time RT-PCR assay","Genomic analysis of new PHEV strains","developed triplex real-time RT-PCR","new assay","set of primers","positive-sense RNA virus","new mutants","differentiation","probe dyes","clinical samples","signals","Abstract Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","regions of NS2","conserved regions","porcine viruses","DNA copies","present study","DNA sequencing","types of clinical manifestations","cross reaction","vomiting","different patterns of deletions","development","respiratory disease","strong evidence","recent findings","end nucleocapsid","older pigs","specificity test","sensitive method","piglets"],"language":"en"},

Intake of aflatoxin-contaminated food results in serious health hazards and even death. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the global scientific output of research of aflatoxin by using bibliometric techniques. METHODS: This bibliometric study was conducted using Scopus database and classified the retrieved publications were classified from different aspects, including the countries/region of focus, journals, authors, institutes, citations, and content analysis to discover any hot and emerging topics. In addition, the bibliometric analysis of the international collaborative network and hot research topics were generated by VOSviewer\u00A9 software version 1.6.10. The publication period was restricted in the search for two decades (1998\u20132017). RESULTS: The search engine of the Scopus database found 9845 documents published in the field of aflatoxin. The USA is the top publishing source in the world (22.85%), followed by China (11.85%), India (9.32%), and Italy (5.25%). In earlier years, researchers focused on terms related to the topics of \u201Csources and biosynthesis of aflatoxin\u201D, \u201Chealth effects by aflatoxin\u201D, and \u201Cdetoxification and treatment of aflatoxin\u201D. However, in recent years, researchers pay more attention to the topic of detection and quantification of aflatoxin. CONCLUSIONS: The quantity of research in global aflatoxin has substantially increased over the past two decades. The evaluation of the historical status and development trend in aflatoxin scientific research can guide future research, and ultimately provide the basis for improving management procedures for governmental decisions, healthcare, industries, and educational institutions.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zyoud, Sa\u2019ed H.","journal":"J Occup Med Toxicol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c4505f3ce59be775697d87a10f448ac2afc7ad7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6873441.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6873441/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["China","India"],"keyphrases":["global aflatoxin","aflatoxin scientific research","biosynthesis of aflatoxin","Intake of aflatoxin","quantification of aflatoxin","treatment of aflatoxin","field of aflatoxin","hot research topics","quantity of research","future research","global scientific output of research","bibliometric analysis","bibliometric study","contaminated food results","Scopus database","emerging topics","bibliometric techniques","researchers","decades","contaminated food products","content analysis","health effects","search engine","earlier years","recent years","serious health hazards","healthcare","international collaborative network","development trend","journals","institutes","fungal metabolites","governmental decisions","historical status","industries","countries","region of focus","authors","management procedures","citations","attention","retrieved publications","VOSviewer","different aspects","topic of detection","Aflatoxins","basis","terms","documents","publishing source","educational institutions","BACKGROUND","evaluation","death","sources","detoxification","software version","USA","world","publication period","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Thus, it could be argued that reversal of this change (\u0394(SOFA)) may reflect sepsis response and could be used as measure of efficacy in interventional trials. We aimed to assess the predictive performance of \u0394(SOFA) for 28-day mortality. METHODS: Data from two previously published randomized controlled trials were studied: the first reporting on patients with severe Gram-negative infections as a derivation cohort and the second reporting on patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia as a validation cohort. Only patients with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 definition were included in this analysis. SOFA scores were calculated on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28. RESULTS: We included 448 patients within the derivation cohort and 199 within the validation cohort. Mean SOFA scores on day 1 were 6.06 \u00B1 4.07 and 7.84 \u00B1 3.39, and 28 day mortality 22.8% and 29.6%, respectively. In the derivation cohort, the earliest time point where \u0394(SOFA) score predicted mortality was day 7 (AUROC (95% CI) 0.84 (0.80\u20130.89); p \u003C 0.001). The best tradeoff for prediction was found with 25% changes (78% sensitivity, 80% specificity); less than 25% decrease of admission SOFA was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio for death 14.87). This finding was confirmed in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: \u0394(SOFA) on day 7 is a useful early prognostic marker of 28-day mortality and could serve as an endpoint in future sepsis trials alongside mortality.

We recruited 581 animal workers (animal-raising farmers, slaughterers, animal health workers, and rat traders) and their families in southern and central Vietnam into a cohort. Cohort members were followed for 3 years and interviewed annually regarding (1) demography and attitudes regarding zoonotic disease, (2) medical history, (3) specific exposures to potential zoonotic infection sources, and (4) socioeconomic status. Interview information over the 3 years was combined and analyzed as cross-sectional data. Of the 297 cohort members interviewed, the majority (79.8%; 237/297) reported raising livestock; almost all (99.6%; 236/237) reported being routinely exposed to domestic animals, and more than a quarter (28.7%; 68/237) were exposed to exotic animals. Overall, 70% (208/297) reported slaughtering exotic animals; almost all (99.5%; 207/208) reported consuming such animals. The consumption of raw blood and meat was common (24.6%; 73/297 and 37%; 110/297, respectively). Over half (58.6%; 174/297) reported recent occupational animal-induced injuries that caused bleeding; the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was limited. Our work demonstrates that individuals working with animals in Vietnam are exposed to a wide range of species, and there are limited procedures for reducing potential zoonotic disease exposures.

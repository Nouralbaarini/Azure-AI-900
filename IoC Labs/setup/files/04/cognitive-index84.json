The majority of these infections are due to viruses. This study attempted to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients with respiratory infection by the coronavirus OC43, NL63 and 229E. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2013 and February 2014, we prospectively studied all patients with suspected clinical respiratory infection by taking throat swabs and performing a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in search of coronavirus. RESULTS: In 48 cases (7.0% of the 686 enrolled patients; 12.6% of the 381 in whom a virus was detected) the presence of a coronavirus demonstrated. In 24 cases, the virus was OC43 (50%); in 14 cases, the virus was NL63 (29%); and in 10 cases, the virus was 229E (21%). The mean age was 54.5 years, with a slight predominance of men. The most common clinical presentations were nonspecific influenza symptoms (43.7%), pneumonia (29.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (8.3%). Fifty-two percent of the patients required hospitalization, and 2 patients required intensive care. There were no deaths. CONCLUSION: Acute respiratory infections caused by coronavirus mainly affect middle-aged male smokers, who are often affected by previous diseases. The most common clinical picture has been nonspecific influenza symptoms.","publish_time":"2014-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reina, J.; L\u00F3pez-Causap\u00E9, C.; Rojo-Molinero, E.; Rubio, R.","journal":"Rev Clin Esp (Barc)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f5a678df36afcc538adfa35a10930c87ae87e42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103947.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2254887414000940; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2254887414000940","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases","enrolled patients","suspected clinical respiratory infection","coronavirus OC43","common clinical presentations","common clinical picture","Acute respiratory infections","search of coronavirus","epidemiological characteristics of adult patients","common condition","nonspecific influenza symptoms","NL63","throat swabs","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation","years","hospitalization","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES","middle-aged male smokers","general population","CONCLUSION","slight predominance of men","intensive care","mean age","pneumonia","percent","presence","previous diseases","majority","viruses","RESULTS","study","METHODS","deaths"],"language":"en"},

The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries. In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries. Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea. Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic. Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic. In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above. The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases. In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy. In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively. This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing. In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reis, Ruy Freitas; de Melo Quintela, B\u00E1rbara; de Oliveira Campos, Joventino; Gomes, Johnny Moreira; Rocha, Bernardo Martins; Lobosco, Marcelo; dos Santos, Rodrigo Weber","journal":"Chaos Solitons Fractals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7221372.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412556/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920302885; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920302885?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109888","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["pandemic","fragile countries","COVID","social isolation","health systems of different countries","isolation policies","Brazil","Italy","effective social distancing","social issues","different scenarios","case of South Korea","importance of mitigation policies","moment","reduction of contact","contact reduction","poor isolation policy","effective treatments","high number","border control","model parameters","fast dynamics","Coronavirus disease","percentage of reported cases","underreporting poses additional challenges","techniques of inverse","forward uncertainty quantification","sensitivity analysis","time-dependent coefficients","management","mathematical models","numbers","phases","emerging economies","essential aspects","absence of vaccines","serious concerns","accounting","territories","deaths","lock","initial phase","half","people","work","cities","world","uncertainties","peak","results","contrast","characterization"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study is to validate these scoring systems with a different set of patients. Methods All adult patients with documented fever, measured at home or at the hospital, and presenting to the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital, a 2,400-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in northern Taiwan, were prospectively enrolled. Two previously developed SARS screening scores were applied to all patients. The final diagnosis of SARS was made by the Expert Committee of the Center for Disease Control Taiwan, Republic of China, according to the criteria of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA. Results A total of 239 adult patients, including 117 men and 122 women, were enrolled. Eighty-two patients were finally diagnosed with SARS. Compared with the SARS patients in the derivation cohort, those in the validation cohort were older (44.5\u00B115.9 versus 33.9\u00B115.9 years), more likely to acquire the disease locally (76.8% versus 37.5%), and more likely to have cough before or during fever. For the non-SARS patients, cases in the validation cohort presented with less cough and coryza but more diarrhea. For the 4-item symptom score, the sensitivity reached 96.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 89.7% to 98.7%) and the specificity 51.6% (95% CI 43.8% to 59.3%). For the 6-item clinical score, the sensitivity reached 92.6% (95% CI 84.8% to 96.6%) and the specificity 71.2% (95% CI 63.6% to 77.7%). When the clinical score was applied to patients with a positive symptom score, the combined sensitivity reached 90.2% (95% CI 82.0% to 95.0%), and the combined specificity reached 80.1% (95% CI 73.2% to 85.6%). Conclusion This prospective study validated the scoring system previously developed by using a different cohort.

Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is essential for decision making, and to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. The present study aimed to estimate the effective reproductive number (Rt) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection during the first 10 days of the outbreak in seven Latin American countries with the highest incidence of cases as of March 23, 2020. Furthermore, we chose to compare the seven countries with Spain and Italy given their history with the virus. Methods Incidence data retrieved from the COVID-19 data repository by Johns Hopkins University were analyzed. The Rt was calculated for the first 10 days of the epidemic in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, and Peru. Rt estimations were compared with Spain and Italy values for the same interval. Results The median Rt for the first 10 days of the COVID-19 epidemic were 2.90 (2.67-3.14) for Spain and 2.83 (2.7-2.96) for Italy. Latin American Rt estimations were higher in Ecuador (3.95(3.7-4.21)), Panama (3.95(3.7-4.21)), and Brazil (3.95(3.7-4.21)). The smallest one was observed in Peru (2.36(2.11-2.63)). All Latin American countries had Rt greater than 2. Conclusions The initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Latin America suggested a high Rt. Interventions such as domestic and international travel restrictions, educational institutions closure, social distancing, and intensified case surveillance should be adopted to prevent the collapse of the health systems.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ochoa, Yaset Caicedo; Sanchez, David E Rebell\u00F3n; Pe\u00F1aloza, Marcela; Motta, Hector F Cortes; M\u00E9ndez-Fandi\u00F1o, Yardany R","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70edf01179e7228e161e51fc5347d3c7862e03ca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.069; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122030285X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360941/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030285X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Johns Hopkins University"],"locations":["Spain","Chile","Colombia","Mexico","Peru","Ecuador","Panama","Brazil","Latin America"],"keyphrases":["COVID","Latin American Rt estimations","epidemic","Latin American countries","Rt greater","median Rt","days","Spain","Ecuador","Italy values","Panama","Brazil","pandemic","Peru","Methods Incidence data","social distancing","social impacts","coronavirus disease","data repository","health systems","highest incidence of cases","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","educational institutions closure","international travel restrictions","Interventions","Chile","SARS-Cov2","effective reproductive number","Colombia","intensified case surveillance","Johns Hopkins University","Mexico","outbreak","Abstract Objectives","decision making","initial stages","infection","Conclusions","history","challenge","present study","collapse","interval","dynamics"],"language":"en"},

This reactivity was compared with the reactivity of na\u00EFve PBMC. Significant IFN-\u03B3 production was determined in ELISA and ELISPOT only after in vitro PBMC re-stimulation with PRV and not with the closely related bovine herpesvirus BHV-1. The PRV-specific IFN-\u03B3 secretion from re-stimulated PBMC showed high levels 6 days after infection, before the presence of serum antibodies, and it persisted at a high level over a 3 months period. The response of a group of eight piglets infected intranasally with PRV varied. Only two animals showed the expected typical fever response. PRV specific IFN-\u03B3 production by PBMC clearly indicated that infection had occurred.

Because of the expanding size and density of its population and the frequent interaction of people with animals, China is a hotspot for the emergence and spread of new microbial threats and is a major contributor to the worldwide infectious disease burden. In recent years, the emergence and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) generated considerable interest in the Chinese healthcare system and its infection control and prevention measures. This review examines antibiotic misuse and the status of antibiotic resistance in the Chinese healthcare system. China has high rates of antibiotic resistance driven by misuse of these agents in a healthcare system that provides strong incentives for overprescribing and in a country where self-medication is common. Tuberculosis remains a serious problem in China, with a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains. Drug resistance amongst nosocomial bacteria has been on a rapid upward trend with a strong inclination towards multidrug resistance. There is a need for effective infection prevention and control measures and strict use of antibiotics in China to control the rise and spread of antibiotic resistance in the country.","publish_time":"2012-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yezli, Saber; Li, Han","journal":"International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5840d371b810ccaf6d9523fd4d6e5bb2c6276be3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135469.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2012.07.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857912003147; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857912003147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999767/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Republic"],"keyphrases":["multidrug resistance","status of antibiotic resistance","antibiotic misuse","high rates of antibiotic resistance","Chinese healthcare system","People\u0027s Republic of China","infection control","control measures","emergence","prevention measures","country","effective infection prevention","high prevalence of multidrug","drug-resistant strains","rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome","strong inclination","strong incentives","world\u0027s population","rapid upward trend","major contributor","strict use of antibiotics","SARS","animals","frequent interaction of people","overprescribing","worldwide infectious disease burden","new microbial threats","nosocomial bacteria","density","need","agents","rise","serious problem","recent years","expanding size","self-medication","Tuberculosis","review","hotspot"],"language":"en"},

Sequence analyses revealed that they had a standard picornavirus genome organization, i.e. 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) - L- P1 (VP4- VP3- VP2- VP1) - P2 (2A- 2B- 2C) - P3 (3A- 3B- 3C-3D) - 3\u2032UTR- poly(A).

The phylogenetic analyses and detailed genome characterization showed that they, together with the unclassified Chinese picornaviruses, grouped as a cluster for the P1, 2C, 3CD and VP1 coding regions. These viruses had conserved features (e.g. predicted protein cleavage sites, presence of a leader protein, 2A, 2C, 3C, and 3D functional domains), suggesting they have a common ancestor. Reverse-transcription-PCR assays, using specific primers designed from the 5\u2032UTR sequence of these viruses, showed that 23.0% (20/87) of fecal samples from cattle with diarrhea were positive, indicating the prevalence of these picornavirus in the Japanese cattle population in Hokkaido Prefecture.

A search strategy involving search terms corresponding to \u2018health\u2019, \u2018industrial worker\u2019, and \u2018Vietnam\u2019 was applied to search for related papers published in English on Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Duplicates were removed, and relevant data were extracted from the full text of remaining publications. Results showed that underlying health problems, including respiratory system problems, were common among industrial workers. Many suffered occupational diseases and/or work-related injuries. Self-treatment (without medication) was the most used method when having health problems (by 28.2% to 51% of participants), followed by visiting commune health centers (24%) and self-medication (20.3%). Findings suggest a high risk of disease spreading among industrial workers and of them suffering more severe conditions when infected.

Due to their widespread use in sport fisheries of the Laurentian Great Lakes, there are increasing concerns that baitfish may introduce or disseminate fish pathogens. In this study, we evaluated whether baitfish purchased from 78 randomly selected retail bait dealers in Michigan harbored fish viruses. Between September 2015 and June 2016, 5,400 baitfish divided into 90 lots of 60 fish were purchased. Fish were tested for the presence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), golden shiner reovirus (GSRV), fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV), fathead minnow picornavirus (FHMPV), and white sucker bunyavirus (WSBV). Using the epithelioma papulosum cyprini cell line and molecular confirmation, we demonstrated the presence of viruses in 18 of the 90 fish lots (20.0%) analyzed. The most prevalent virus was FHMNV, being detected in 6 of 30 lots of Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas and 3 of 42 lots of Emerald Shiners Notropis atherinoides. We also confirmed GSRV in two fish species: the Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas (5 of 11 lots) and Fathead Minnow (3 of 30 lots). Two VHSV (genotype IVb) isolates were recovered from a single lot of Emerald Shiners. No SVCV, FHMPV, or WSBV was detected in any of the fish examined. Some of the infected fish exhibited clinical signs and histopathological alterations. This study demonstrates that live baitfish are a potential vector for the spread of viral pathogens and underscores the importance of fish health certifications for the Great Lakes baitfish industry.","publish_time":"2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boonthai, Traimat; Loch, Thomas P.; Zhang, Qingli; Van Deuren, Michelle Gunn; Faisal, Mohamed; Whelan, Gary E.; Herbst, Seth J.","journal":"J Aquat Anim Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/053af956a7f17a8a0381ef99662372587697874e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159410.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30315600/; https://doi.org/10.1002/aah.10034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fathead Minnow Pimephales","GSRV","Fathead Minnow","VHSV","Emerald Shiners","WSBV"],"locations":["Great Lakes","Michigan"],"keyphrases":["fish lots","fish pathogens","infected fish","Great Lakes baitfish industry","Michigan harbored fish viruses","live baitfish","importance of fish health certifications","fathead minnow nidovirus","fathead minnow picornavirus","Indigenous small cyprinid fish species","dollar baitfish industry","Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas","Laurentian Great Lakes","Great Lakes ecosystems","VHSV","SVCV","prevalent virus","FHMPV","FHMNV","GSRV","presence of viruses","WSBV","study","presence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus","golden shiner reovirus","spread of viral pathogens","spring viremia of carp virus","Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas","single lot of Emerald Shiners","Emerald Shiners Notropis atherinoides","important role","selected retail bait dealers","molecular confirmation","sport fisheries","epithelioma papulosum cyprini cell line","potential vector","isolates","clinical signs","backbone","histopathological alterations","white sucker bunyavirus","multimillion","widespread use","genotype IVb","concerns"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of clinical samples from patients with new viral infections is critical to confirm the diagnosis, to specify the viral load, and to sequence data necessary for characterizing the viral kinetics, transmission, and evolution. We analyzed samples from 112 patients infected with the recently discovered Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Methods. Respiratory tract samples from cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were investigated to determine the MERS-CoV load and fraction of the MERS-CoV genome. These values were analyzed to determine associations with clinical sample type. Results. Samples from 112 individuals in which MERS-CoV was detected by PCR were analyzed, of which 13 were sputum samples, 64 were nasopharyngeal swab specimens, 30 were tracheal aspirates, and 3 were bronchoalveolar lavage specimens; 2 samples were of unknown origin. Tracheal aspirates yielded significantly higher MERS-CoV loads, compared with nasopharyngeal swab specimens (P = .005) and sputum specimens (P = .0001). Tracheal aspirates had viral loads similar to those in bronchoalveolar lavage samples (P = .3079). Bronchoalveolar lavage samples and tracheal aspirates had significantly higher genome fraction than nasopharyngeal swab specimens (P = .0095 and P = .0002, respectively) and sputum samples (P = .0009 and P = .0001, respectively).

Considering the significance of PEDV, a systemic analysis was performed to study its codon usage patterns. The relative synonymous codon usage value of each codon revealed that codon usage bias exists and that PEDV tends to use codons that end in T. The mean ENC value of 47.91 indicates that the codon usage bias is low. However, we still wanted to identify the cause of this codon usage bias. A correlation analysis between the codon compositions (A3s, T3s, G3s, C3s, and GC3s), the ENC values, and the nucleotide contents (A%, T%, G%, C%, and GC%) indicated that mutational bias plays role in shaping the PEDV codon usage bias. This was further confirmed by a principal component analysis between the codon compositions and the axis values. Using the Gravy, Aroma, and CAI values, a role of natural selection in the PEDV codon usage pattern was also identified. Neutral analysis indicated that natural selection pressure plays a more important role than mutational bias in codon usage bias. Natural selection also plays an increasingly significant role during PEDV evolution. Additionally, gene function and geographic distribution also influence the codon usage bias to a degree.","publish_time":"2014-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ye; Shi, Yuzhen; Deng, Hongjuan; Gu, Ting; Xu, Jian; Ou, Jinxin; Jiang, Zhiguo; Jiao, Yiren; Zou, Tan; Wang, Chong","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbada6c16e74f3dda02b4572f30520e733972c1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185563.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239728/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134814003220; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.09.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134814003220","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","T.

Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments.

For this purpose, a magnetic device generating 7.5 T/m uniform magnetic field gradient was designed and incorporated to a commercial spectrophotometer. Different batches of colloidal superparamagnetic particles (SMPs), with different elemental compositions, were functionalized with twenty-mer complementary oligonucleotides, TB1 and TB2. When the functionalized SMPs-TB1 and SMPs-TB2 are mixed and incubated, the hybridization process of TB1 and TB2 occurs resulting in the formation of colloidal aggregates. When brought under the magnetic field, depending on the magnetic strength (\u0393) of the formed aggregates, they separate either faster or slower than the non-functionalized SMPs. The difference in magnetic separation time (\u0394t) is optically monitored by measuring the real time transparency of the suspension at specific wavelengths.

Based on the changes of \u0394t, the study addresses how electrosteric, magnetic, and hydrogen bonding interactions affect the hybridization process and suggests optimum experimental conditions for accurate monitoring of TB1-TB2 hybridization.","publish_time":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benelmekki, Maria; Gasso, Sergi; Martinez, Lluis M.","journal":"Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f778b09d0ae1add698e80d900a6bccde4a5261d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422560/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.111126; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776520303568; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0927776520303568","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SMPs-TB2","TB2 hybridization","functionalized SMPs-TB1","magnetic device","magnetic strength","hybridization process of TB1","magnetic separation time","accurate monitoring of TB1","non-functionalized SMPs","uniform magnetic field gradient","detection of aggregates","monitoring of DNA hybridization","formed aggregates","formation of colloidal aggregates","accurate assembly","prognosis of diseases","\u0394 t","changes of \u0394t","Different batches of colloidal superparamagnetic particles","separation of small biomolecules","affordable treatments of diseases","real time transparency","different elemental compositions","hospital logistic efficiency","optimum experimental conditions","great benefits","patient care","early diagnosis","complex mixtures","hydrogen bonding interactions","isolation of molecular biomarkers","ofUV","analyses","recovering","potential","possibility","vis-spectroscopy","suspension","work","magnetophoresis","electrosteric","presenta method","cost-effective tools","concentrations","study","mer complementary oligonucleotides","difference","specific wavelengths","purpose","commercial spectrophotometer"],"language":"en"},

In general, there are no reliable clinical or radiological features to distinguish viral from other causes of pneumonia. Respiratory viruses often show seasonality and a predilection for certain host groups. These epidemiological features are helpful in gauging the differential diagnoses. Confirmation of infection relies on laboratory investigations based on conventional approaches including direct viral antigen detection by specific monoclonal antibodies, virus isolation, and serology, as well as modern molecular approaches to amplify viral nucleic acid present in clinical specimens.

Airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to humans from the environment, animals, or other humans can result in disease. Inhalation is an important route of exposure as the lung is more susceptible to infection than the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested microorganisms must pass through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Following inhalation, infectious viruses, bacteria, and fungi can establish in host cells of the respiratory tract. Some are translocated and infect the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues. This article discusses human viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases transmitted via aerosols. Viral diseases presented are influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), enteric viruses related infections, hantavirus disease, measles, and varicella. Bacterial diseases are Legionnaires\u2019 disease, tuberculosis, and nontubercule mycobacterial disease. Exposure to some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, endotoxin, and actinomycetes when dispersed through the air can result in disease following inhalation.

We have hypothesized that because the germline antibodies are so different from the mature HIV-1-specific bnAbs they may not bind the epitopes of the mature antibodies and provided the first evidence to support this hypothesis by using individual putative germline-like predecessor antibodies. To further validate the hypothesis and understand initial immune responses to different viruses, two phage-displayed human cord blood-derived IgM libraries were constructed which contained mostly germline antibodies or antibodies with very low level of somatic hypermutations. They were panned against different HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), SARS CoV protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble Hendra virus G protein (sG). Despite a high sequence and combinatorial diversity observed in the cord blood-derived IgM antibody repertoire, no enrichment for binders of Envs was observed in contrast to considerable specific enrichments produced with panning against RBD and sG; one of the selected monoclonal antibodies (against the RBD) was of high (nM) affinity with only few somatic mutations. These results further support and expand our initial hypothesis for fundamental differences in immune responses leading to elicitation of bnAbs against HIV-1 compared to SARS CoV and Hendra virus. HIV-1 uses a strategy to minimize or eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies to its Env; in contrast, SARS CoV and Hendra virus, and perhaps other viruses causing acute infections, can bind germline antibody or minimally somatically mutated antibodies with relatively high affinity which could be one of the reasons for the success of sG and RBD as vaccine immunogens.","publish_time":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Weizao; Streaker, Emily D.; Russ, Daniel E.; Feng, Yang; Prabakaran, Ponraj; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e576312dc83755e3c8ba63e6205553c0aae93d0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0c33188dd394af693bd7f867cb2b4c8f392a415f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3268823.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22226962/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X11022984; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3268823?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.089; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X11022984","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","RBD","SARS CoV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mature antibodies","mutated antibodies","predecessor antibodies","neutralizing antibodies","strong binding of germline antibodies","RBD","germline antibody","selected monoclonal antibodies","different HIV","mature HIV","Nipah virus","SARS coronavirus","contrast","specific bnAbs","known HIV","individual putative germline","soluble Hendra virus G protein","SARS CoV protein receptor-binding domain","initial hypothesis","elicitation of bnAbs","different viruses","high affinity","initial immune responses","success of sG","high sequence","support","cord blood-derived IgM antibody repertoire","human cord blood-derived IgM libraries","binders of Envs","somatic mutations","considerable specific enrichments","low level of somatic hypermutations","phage","fundamental differences","envelope glycoproteins","combinatorial diversity","panning","acute infections","nM","vaccine immunogens","strategy","evidence","epitopes","reasons","results"],"language":"en"},

Reverse genetic studies provide evidence that inhibition of viral enzymes belonging to the capping pathway leads to inhibition of virus replication. The replication defect results from reduced protein synthesis as well as from detection of incompletely capped RNAs by cellular innate immunity sensors. Thus, it is now admitted that capping enzymes are validated antiviral targets, as their inhibition will support an antiviral response in addition to the attenuation of viral mRNA translation.

HBoV genomic DNA is frequently detected in both ill and healthy children. We hypothesized that spliced viral capsid messenger RNA (mRNA) produced during active replication might be a better marker for acute infection. METHODS: As part of the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study, children aged \u003C18 years who were hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and children asymptomatic at the time of elective outpatient surgery (controls) were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens were tested for HBoV mRNA and genomic DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: HBoV DNA was detected in 10.4% of 1295 patients with CAP and 7.5% of 721 controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.0\u20132.0]); HBoV mRNA was detected in 2.1% and 0.4%, respectively (OR, 5.1 [95% CI, 1.6\u201326]). When adjusted for age, enrollment month, and detection of other respiratory viruses, HBoV mRNA detection (adjusted OR, 7.6 [95% CI, 1.5\u201338.4]) but not DNA (adjusted OR, 1.2 [95% CI, .6\u20132.4]) was associated with CAP. Among children with no other pathogens detected, HBoV mRNA (OR, 9.6 [95% CI, 1.9\u201382]) was strongly associated with CAP. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of HBoV mRNA but not DNA was associated with CAP, supporting a pathogenic role for HBoV in CAP. HBoV mRNA could be a useful target for diagnostic testing.","publish_time":"2017-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schlaberg, Robert; Ampofo, Krow; Tardif, Keith D; Stockmann, Chris; Simmon, Keith E; Hymas, Weston; Flygare, Steven; Kennedy, Brett; Blaschke, Anne; Eilbeck, Karen; Yandell, Mark; McCullers, Jon A; Williams, Derek J; Edwards, Kathryn; Arnold, Sandra R; Bramley, Anna; Jain, Seema; Pavia, Andrew T","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/354555332b24b37adcbc9b032b1357b8bebf9299.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5853397.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jix352; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/216/6/688/24264367/jix352.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28934425/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV DNA","HBoV mRNA detection","Detection of HBoV mRNA","HBoV genomic DNA","children asymptomatic","healthy children","controls","Community","respiratory viruses","respiratory illness","pathogenic role","Etiology of Pneumonia","role of human bocavirus","time of elective outpatient surgery","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","spliced viral capsid messenger RNA","better marker","useful target","active replication","study","EPIC","oropharyngeal specimens","enrollment month","acute infection","diagnostic testing","BACKGROUND","age","years","CONCLUSIONS","pathogens","odds ratio","confidence interval","RESULTS","METHODS","patients"],"language":"en"},

Methods An NLS (non-linear least square) method estimated the parameters of a differentiated logistic growth function of new COVID-19 cases in multiple regions in China and nations with a large amount of cases based on training data from Feb. 20 to Mar. 13. A restriction test was subsequently employed to test whether a designated parameter was identical among regions or countries. We conducted diagnosis of the residuals and also its goodness of fit with testing data from Mar. 13 to Apr. 18. Findings We find that the model fits time series data exceedingly well in China, its provinces, and two other nations, and we provide estimates of key parameters. We reject the null hypothesis that the growth rate of the outbreak is the same among ten selected provinces as well as between South Korea and Iran. We also find that the model does not provide reliable estimates in countries that are in the early stages of outbreak. We further find that the R 2 value be varied and misleading when compared among different curves of the same nonlinear model, as well as the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and nations. Conclusion We believe that there is potential for our model to contribute to better public health policy combatting COVID-19 by providing a simple logistical framework for retrospectively analyzing the outbreak in regions that have already experienced maximal proliferation in cases. However, based upon our statistical findings, we outline certain pitfalls in modelling and their implications on results.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Christopher Y.","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376306/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.085; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303039?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjszMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","South Korea","Iran"],"keyphrases":["nations","China","cases","nonlinear model","selected provinces","residuals","implications","multiple regions","model fits time series data","countries","testing data","training data","early stages of outbreak","statistical findings","modelling","differentiated logistic growth function of new COVID","estimates of key parameters","better public health policy combatting COVID","growth rate","global pandemic","maximal proliferation","reliable estimates","restriction test","positive serial correlation","existence of heteroskedasticity","certain pitfalls","study of infectious diseases","NLS","different curves","goodness of fit","experiences","South Korea","designated parameter","Methods","null hypothesis","simple logistical framework","paper","Abstract Objective","value","Iran","results","Conclusion","diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

In this study, diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) were detected in 50 of 951 (positive rate 5.3%) intestinal specimens of eight bat species collected in four provinces and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China by pan-coronavirus RT-PCR screening. Based on 400-nt RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) sequence analysis, eight belonged to genus Alphacoronavirus and 42 to Betacoronavirus. Among the 50 positive specimens, thirteen gave rise to CoV full-length RdRP gene amplification for further sequence comparison, of which three divergent sequences (two from a unreported province) were subjected to full genome sequencing. Two complete genomes of betacoronaviruses (JTMC15 and JPDB144) and one nearly-complete genome of alphacoronavirus (JTAC2) were sequenced and their genomic organization predicted. The present study has identified additional numbers of genetically diverse bat-borne coronaviruses with a wide distribution in China. Two new species of bat CoV, identified through sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis, are proposed.

The vast majority of the available information on this topic focuses on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; Family Paramyxoviridae, genus Pneumovirus), an important pediatric pathogen that infects infants worldwide. There is no vaccine currently available for RSV. A formalininactivated RSV vaccine used in a trial in the 1960s elicited immunopathology in response to natural RSV infection; this has been modeled experimentally, primarily in inbred mice and cotton rats. Eosinophils are recruited to the lung tissue in response to formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine antigens in humans and in experimental models, but they may or may not be involved in promoting the severe clinical sequelae observed. Pulmonary eosinophilia elicited in response to primary RSV infection has also been explored; this response is particularly evident in the youngest human infants and in neonatal mouse models. Although pulmonary eosinophilia is nearly always perceived in a negative light, the specific role played by virus-elicited eosinophils - negative, positive or neutral bystander - remain unclear. Lastly, we consider the data that focus on the role of eosinophils in promoting virus clearance and antiviral host defense, and conclude with a recent study that explores the role of eosinophils themselves as targets of virus infection.

We detected viruses known to cause diarrhea, non-pathogenic enteric viruses, viruses not associated with an enteric reservoir, viruses of plants, and novel viruses. Viromes from Northern Territory children contained more viral families per sample than viromes from Melbourne, which could be attributed largely to an increased number of sequences from the families Adenoviridae and Picornaviridae (genus enterovirus). qRT-PCR/PCR confirmed the increased prevalence of adenoviruses and enteroviruses. Testing of additional diarrhea cohorts by qRT-PCR/PCR demonstrated statistically different prevalences in different geographic sites.

Next generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR amplicons (NGS 16S amplicon analysis) is a powerful culture-independent open reference method that has recently been used to increase understanding of BRD-associated bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of BRD cattle. However, it has not yet been used to examine the microbiome of the bovine lower respiratory tract. The objective of this study was to use NGS 16S amplicon analysis to identify bacteria in post-mortem lung and lymph node tissue samples harvested from fatal BRD cases and clinically healthy animals. Cranial lobe and corresponding mediastinal lymph node post-mortem tissue samples were collected from calves diagnosed as BRD cases by veterinary laboratory pathologists and from clinically healthy calves. NGS 16S amplicon libraries, targeting the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME) was used to determine operational taxonomic units (OTUs) which corresponded to the 16S rRNA gene sequences. RESULTS: Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma, Pasteurellaceae, and Fusobacterium were the most abundant OTUs identified in the lungs and lymph nodes of the calves which died from BRD. Leptotrichiaceae, Fusobacterium, Mycoplasma, Trueperella and Bacteroides had greater relative abundances in post-mortem lung samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves, compared with clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma and Pasteurellaceae showed higher relative abundances in post-mortem lymph node samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves, compared with clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Two Leptotrichiaceae sequence contigs were subsequently assembled from bacterial DNA-enriched shotgun sequences. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiomes of the cranial lung lobe and mediastinal lymph node from calves which died from BRD and from clinically healthy H-F calves have been characterised. Contigs corresponding to the abundant Leptotrichiaceae OTU were sequenced and found not to be identical to any known bacterial genus. This suggests that we have identified a novel bacterial species associated with BRD.

Unlike Eimeria, a single-host enteric pathogen, Sarcocystis, Neospora, and Toxoplasma are two-host parasites that infect and produce infectious tissue cysts in a wide range of intermediate hosts. As a genus, Sarcocystis is one of the most successful protozoan parasites; all vertebrates, including birds, reptiles, fish, and mammals are hosts to at least one Sarcocystis species. Here we sequenced Sarcocystis neurona, the causal agent of fatal equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. The S. neurona genome is 127 Mbp, more than twice the size of other sequenced coccidian genomes. Comparative analyses identified conservation of the invasion machinery among the coccidia. However, many dense-granule and rhoptry kinase genes, responsible for altering host effector pathways in Toxoplasma and Neospora, are absent from S. neurona. Further, S. neurona has a divergent repertoire of SRS proteins, previously implicated in tissue cyst formation in Toxoplasma. Systems-based analyses identified a series of metabolic innovations, including the ability to exploit alternative sources of energy. Finally, we present an S. neurona model detailing conserved molecular innovations that promote the transition from a purely enteric lifestyle (Eimeria) to a heteroxenous parasite capable of infecting a wide range of intermediate hosts.","publish_time":"2015-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blazejewski, Tomasz; Nursimulu, Nirvana; Pszenny, Viviana; Dangoudoubiyam, Sriveny; Namasivayam, Sivaranjani; Chiasson, Melissa A.; Chessman, Kyle; Tonkin, Michelle; Swapna, Lakshmipuram S.; Hung, Stacy S.; Bridgers, Joshua; Ricklefs, Stacy M.; Boulanger, Martin J.; Dubey, Jitender P.; Porcella, Stephen F.; Kissinger, Jessica C.; Howe, Daniel K.; Grigg, Michael E.; Parkinson, John","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28d987c4ec40dafc05993e3a209ea4266f270f28.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a5fddb00475627b88f2761218d9e6a572d14f90d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4337577.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25670772/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02445-14","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sarcocystis","S. neurona"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sarcocystis neurona","Toxoplasma","neurona model","Sarcocystis species","neurona genome","host parasites","Neospora","Eimeria","wide range of intermediate hosts","single-host enteric pathogen","host effector pathways","celled parasites of medical","successful protozoan parasites","clade of single","enteric lifestyle","Comparative analyses","infectious tissue cysts","series of metabolic innovations","conserved molecular innovations","tissue cyst formation","Systems-based analyses","sequenced coccidian genomes","veterinary importance","rhoptry kinase genes","causal agent of fatal equine protozoal myeloencephalitis","ability","vertebrates","transition","heteroxenous parasite capable","dense-granule","invasion machinery","divergent repertoire of SRS proteins","reptiles","size","conservation","birds","member","alternative sources of energy","fish","Mbp","mammals","genus"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we investigate the spatial distribution of observed diarrhoea and fever prevalence in Malawi using individual data for 10,185 children from the 2000 Malawi Demographic and Health survey. We highlight inequalities in child health by mapping the residual district spatial effects using a geo-additive probit model that simultaneously controls for spatial dependence in the data and potential nonlinear effects of covariates. The residual spatial effects were modelled via a Bayesian approach. For both ailments, we were able to identify a distinct district pattern of childhood morbidity. In particular, the results suggest that children living in the capital city are less affected by fever, although this is not true for diarrhoea, where some urban agglomerations are associated with a higher childhood morbidity risk. The spatial patterns emphasize the role of remoteness as well as climatic, environmental, and geographic factors on morbidity. The fixed effects show that for diarrhoea, the risk of child morbidity appears to be lower among infants who are exclusively breastfed than among those who are mixed-fed. However, exclusive breastfeeding was not found to have a protective effect on fever. An important socio-economic factor for both diarrhoea and fever morbidity was parental education, especially maternal educational attainment. Diarrhoea and fever were both observed to show an interesting association with child\u0027s age. We were able to discern the continuous worsening of the child morbidity up to 8\u201312 months of age. This deterioration set in right after birth and continues, more or less linearly until 8\u201312 months, before beginning to decline thereafter. Independent of other factors, a separate spatial process produces district inequalities in child\u0027s health.","publish_time":"2006-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kandala, Ngianga-Bakwin; Magadi, Monica Akinyi; Madise, Nyovani Janet","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/119f62415e2acfe16087cfde48f3ed7b3d145703.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126797.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953605004016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953605004016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Malawi","Malawi Demographic"],"keyphrases":["fever morbidity","risk of child morbidity","spatial patterns","residual spatial effects","residual district spatial effects","spatial distribution of observed diarrhoea","spatial dependence","child health","fever prevalence","higher childhood morbidity risk","distinct district pattern of childhood morbidity","separate spatial process","district inequalities","child\u0027s health","fixed effects","children","Health survey","child\u0027s age","ailments","months of age","leading causes of child mortality","potential nonlinear effects of covariates","individual data","Malawi Demographic","geographic factors","affected communities","parental education","Sub-Saharan Africa","geo-additive probit model","detailed studies","role of remoteness","maternal educational attainment","malaria","urban agglomerations","capital city","important socio-economic factor","continuous worsening","interesting association","determinants","Bayesian approach","mixed-","exclusive breastfeeding","deterioration","right","birth","results","protective effect","paper","infants"],"language":"en"},

Previous reports showed that host factors, the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein, can block the replication of pathogens and affect their pathogenesis. BALB/c mice are routine laboratory animals used in influenza virus research, but the effects of H9N2 influenza virus on tissue distribution and expression pattern of IFITM in these mice are unknown. Here, we investigated the expression patterns and tissue distribution of IFITM1 and IFITM3 in BALB/c mice by infection with H9N2 AIV strains with only a PB2 residue 627 difference. The results showed that the expression patterns of ITITM1 and IFITM3 differ in various tissues of BALB/c mice at different time points after infection. IFITM1 and IFITM3 showed cell- and tissue-specific distribution in the lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney and brain. Notably, the epithelial and neuronal cells all expressed the proteins of IFITM1 and IFITM3. Our results provide the first look at differences in IFITM1 and IFITM3 expression patterns in BALB/c mice infected by H9N2 influenza viruses. This will enhance research on the interaction between AIV and host and further will elucidate the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection based on the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein.

Infections are a major complication of cancer and its treatment. Community acquired respiratory viral infections (CRV) in these patients increase morbidity, mortality and can lead to delay in chemotherapy. These are the result of infections with a heterogeneous group of viruses including RNA viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (RhV), and coronavirus (CoV). These infections maintain a similar seasonal pattern to those of immunocompetent patients. Clinical manifestations vary significantly depending on the type of virus and the type and degree of immunosuppression, ranging from asymptomatic or mild disease to rapidly progressive fatal pneumonia Infections in this population are characterized by a high rate of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract infection and prolonged viral shedding. Use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy are risk factors for severe disease. The clinical course is often difficult to predict, and clinical signs are unreliable. Accurate prognostic viral and immune markers, which have become part of the standard of care for systemic viral infections, are currently lacking; and management of CRV infections remains controversial. Defining effective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies is challenging, especially considering, the spectrum of immunocompromised patients, the variety of respiratory viruses, and the presence of other opportunistic infections and medical problems. Prevention remains one of the most important strategies against these viruses. Early diagnosis, supportive care and antivirals at an early stage, when available and indicated, have proven beneficial. However, with the exception of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza infection, there are no accepted treatments. In high-risk patients, pre-emptive treatment with antivirals for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) to decrease progression to LRTI is a common strategy. In the future, viral load and immune markers may prove beneficial in predicting severe disease, supporting decision making and monitor treatment in this population.","publish_time":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hijano, Diego R.; Maron, Gabriela; Hayden, Randall T.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6c10d7b9b6a71574918af6a89617962c6bbcf3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6299032.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619176/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.03097","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Community","CRV","LRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viral infections","systemic viral infections","opportunistic infections","result of infections","management of CRV infections","respiratory syncytial virus","variety of respiratory viruses","upper respiratory tract infection","viral load","type of virus","lower respiratory tract infection","progressive fatal pneumonia Infections","influenza infection","RNA viruses","severe disease","parainfluenza virus","immunocompetent patients","high-risk patients","prolonged viral shedding","antivirals","mild disease","heterogeneous group of viruses","immune markers","pre-emptive treatment","monitor treatment","population","spectrum of immunocompromised patients","mortality","clinical signs","clinical course","Clinical manifestations","supportive care","standard of care","early stage","Early diagnosis","pediatric cancer","therapeutic strategies","important strategies","high rate of progression","significant cause of morbidity","major complication of cancer","risk factors","URTI","immunosuppressive therapy","metapneumovirus","presence","RSV","similar seasonal pattern","RhV","rhinovirus","HMPV","corticosteroids","time","LRTI","PIV","degree of immunosuppression","exception of neuraminidase inhibitors","decision","future","Community","medical problems","coronavirus","Survival rates","common strategy","children","accepted treatments","CoV","delay","chemotherapy","Prevention"],"language":"en"},

Biophysical approaches including 3D structural analysis are essential for revealing glycan-protein interactions at the atomic level. The inherent diversity of glycans suits them to function as identification tags, e.g., distinguish self from the nonself components of pathogens. However, the complexity of glycans and poor affinities for interaction partners limit the usefulness of conventional analyses. To cope with such troublesome glycans, a logical sequence of biophysical analyses need to be developed. In this chapter, we introduce a workflow of glycan-protein interaction analysis consisting of six steps: preparation of lectin and glycan, screening of glycan ligand, determination of binding epitope, quantitative interaction analysis, 3D structural analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation. Our increasing knowledge and understanding of lectin-glycan interactions will hopefully lead to the design of glyco-based medicines and vaccines.","publish_time":"2018-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagae, Masamichi; Yamaguchi, Yoshiki","journal":"Glycobiophysics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93dc2b8f657ab8f0e0d4a70e692415306c3eb33d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153041.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30484247/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-2158-0_7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Glycan-protein interactions","workflow of glycan","lectin-glycan interactions","protein interaction analysis","screening of glycan ligand","glycan-dependent mechanisms","quantitative interaction analysis","D structural analysis","interaction partners","troublesome glycans","complexity of glycans","logical sequence of biophysical analyses","usefulness of conventional analyses","inherent diversity of glycans","preparation of lectin","Biophysical approaches","determination of binding epitope","steps","poor affinities","molecular dynamics simulation","considerable importance","based medicines","design of glyco","physiological events","atomic level","nonself components of pathogens","vaccines","identification tags","increasing knowledge","chapter"],"language":"en"},

The underlying virus\u2013host interactions and cellular mechanisms that promote co-existence remain ill-defined, but physiological traits such as flight and longevity are proposed to drive these adaptations. Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic process that regulates ageing, metabolism, and intrinsic immune defense. We quantified basal and stimulated autophagic responses in black flying fox cells, and demonstrated that although black flying fox cells are susceptible to Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) infection, viral replication is dampened in these bat cells. Black flying fox cells tolerated prolonged ABLV infection with less cell death relative to comparable human cells, suggesting post-entry mechanisms interference with virus replication. An elevated basal autophagic level was observed and autophagy was induced in response to high virus doses. Pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy pathway reduced virus replication, indicating autophagy acts as an anti-viral mechanism. Enhancement of basal and virus-induced autophagy in bat cells connects related reports that long-lived species possess homeostatic processes that dampen oxidative stress and macromolecule damage. Exemplifying the potential that evolved cellular homeostatic adaptations like autophagy may secondarily act as anti-viral mechanisms, enabling bats to serve as natural hosts to an assortment of pathogenic viruses.

Deoxynivalenol (DON), the most abundant trichothecene in food and feed, causes vomit and diarrhea in animals and human. However, whether DON exposure could affect PEDV infection remains unknown. Herein, we investigated the impacts of DON on entry and replication of PEDV, morbidity situation of piglets and the mechanisms involved. In vivo, twenty-seven piglets infected naturally with PEDV were randomly divided into three groups, receiving the basal diet containing 0, 750 and 1500 \u03BCg/kg DON, respectively. We observed significant increases in the diarrhea rates, the villous injury of jejunums and the PEDV proliferation of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and mesenterium of piglets in experimental groups compared with control. Additionally, the autophagosome-like vesicles and the autophagy-related protein expressions were also increased in experimental groups. In vitro, we observed that, approximately 2 hrs post-infection, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 \u03BCM DON promoted PEDV entry (P \u003C 0.05) in IPEC-J2s and resulted in tight junction protein occludin internalization. Knockdown of occludin and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of LC3B indicated a vital role of autophagy-induced occludin internalization in DON-promoted PEDV entry. We also observed that, 24 hrs post-infection, a significant increase in PEDV replication after 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 \u03BCM DON treatment, along with the induction of a complete autophagy. Specifically, deletion of LC3B indicated a crucial role of autophagy in DON-promoted PEDV replication. Pretreatment with SB202190, a p38 signaling inhibitor, abolished the induction of autophagy. Furthermore, downregulation of type I interferon revealed that DON contributed PEDV to escape innate immune. Mechanistically, DON-caused innate immune escape was related to the upregulation of LC3B, which further inhibited STING phosphorylation. Taken together, DON could promote PEDV infection by inducing occludin internalization and innate immune escape via triggering p38-mediated autophagy. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a devastating enteric disease, leads to catastrophic economic loss to the global pig industry. Its primary pathogen is the coronavirus PED virus (PEDV). Growing evidence indicates that pathogen infection is not the only factor of PED outbreaks, other non-infectious factors is also related to this disease. We guessed some ubiquitous substances, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), that lead to pig intestinal epithelial cell stress might encourage the progress and spread of PED. In the present study, the weaning piglets infected naturally with PEDV and the IPEC-J2 cell line were selected as models to explore the effects of DON on PEDV infection, morbidity and gut barrier. Our results showed that DON exposure can promote PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanism might be related to LC3B-mediated autophagy. Our findings reveal new pathways for developing potential novel antiviral strategies against PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Dandan; Ge, Lei; Wang, Qing; Su, Jiarui; Chen, Xingxiang; Wang, Chunfeng; Huang, Kehe","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b35c7c617fef6a34e11184e896a035e37afef4ce.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c2510fbc213aa74c6c3195cbc8033c7d0f11b248.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/852608","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Deoxynivalenol","DON"],"organizations":["PEDV","PED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infection","replication of PEDV","PEDV replication","PEDV entry","DON exposure","effects of DON","impacts of DON","PEDV proliferation of duodenum","\u03BCM DON treatment","pathogen infection","LC3B-mediated autophagy","induction of autophagy","complete autophagy","hrs post-infection","autophagy-related protein expressions","vital role of autophagy","crucial role of autophagy","triggering p38-mediated autophagy","diarrhea rates","severe diarrhea","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","innate immune escape","induced occludin internalization","mediated knockout of LC3B","coronavirus PED virus","Knockdown of occludin","upregulation of LC3B","deletion of LC3B","mesenterium of piglets","weaning piglets","experimental groups","morbidity situation of piglets","tight junction protein occludin internalization","factor of PED outbreaks","Deoxynivalenol","contagious pathogenic virus","IPEC-J2 cell line","primary pathogen","significant increases","IPEC-J2s","pig intestinal epithelial cell stress","global pig industry","devastating enteric disease","potential novel antiviral strategies","catastrophic economic loss","ileum","new pathways","villous injury of jejunums","CRISPR-Cas9","vomit","feed","dehydration","models","food","pigs","non-infectious factors","progress","abundant trichothecene","inhibitor","vesicles","interferon","gut barrier","inhibited STING phosphorylation","findings","SB202190","basal diet","present study","animals","human","mechanisms","\u03BCg","Growing evidence","control","downregulation of type","ubiquitous substances","ages","Pretreatment","underlying mechanism","autophagosome","results"],"language":"en"},

Immucillins are compared to the Glucantime standard drug in the chemotherapy of Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi infection in mice and hamsters. These agents are tested for toxicity and immune system response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: BALB/c mice were infected with 10(7) amastigotes, treated with IA, IH, SMIH or Glucantime (2.5mg/kg/day) and monitored for clinical variables, parasite load, antibody levels and splenocyte IFN-\u03B3, TNF-\u03B1, and IL-10 expression. Cytokines and CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B and CD19\u002B lymphocyte frequencies were assessed in uninfected controls and in response to immucillins. Urea, creatinine, GOT and GPT levels were monitored in sera. Anti-Leishmania-specific IgG1 antibodies (anti-NH36) increased in untreated animals. IgG2a response, high levels of IFN-\u03B3, TNF-\u03B1 and lower levels of IL-10 were detected in mice treated with the immucillins and Glucantime. Immucillins permitted normal weight gain, prevented hepato-splenomegaly and cleared the parasite infection (85\u201389%) without renal and hepatic toxicity. Immucillins promoted 35% lower secretion of IFN-\u03B3 in uninfected controls than in infected mice. IA and IH increased the CD4\u002B T and CD19\u002B B cell frequencies. SMIH increased only the proportion of CD-19 B cells. IA and IH also cured infected hamsters with lower toxicity than Glucantime. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Immucillins IA, IH and SMIH were effective in treating leishmaniasis in mice. In hamsters, IA and IH were also effective. The highest therapeutic efficacy was obtained with IA, possibly due to its induction of a TH1 immune response. Low immucillin doses were required and showed no toxicity.

The fact that all patients displayed recovery from their clinical symptoms gives raise to the hypothesis that P. jirovecii infections may also occur in immunocompetent patients but with milder symptoms.","publish_time":"2016-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prickartz, Alexander; L\u00FCsebrink, Jessica; Khalfaoui, Soumaya; Schildgen, Oliver; Schildgen, Verena; Windisch, Wolfram; Brockmann, Michael","journal":"J Fungi (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bc8260cced4bb0e0e3f505abaa2d7498901e8c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5753078.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jof2020016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29376933/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunocompetent patients","jirovecii infections","jirovecii testing","total cohort of patients","Non-pneumonia Pneumocystis jirovecii colonization","immunocompetent individuals","jirovecii low-titer detections","milder symptoms","clinical symptoms","immunosuppressive therapy","successful antibiotic therapy","laboratory pathogen detection","recurrent pulmonary infections","response","chronic cough","raise","recovery","hypothesis","regular antibody titers","impact","complete medical records available","retrospective analysis","qPCR","fact","cotrimoxazole","autoimmune diseases","aim"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies have focused on the biogenesis and composition of exosomes as well as regulation of exosome release. Exosomes have been shown to be released by cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origin, yet their function remains enigmatic. Much of the prior work has focused on exosomes as a source of tumor antigens and in presentation of tumor antigens to T cells. However, new studies have shown that exosomes might also promote cell-to-cell spread of infectious agents. Moreover, exosomes isolated from cells infected with various intra-cellular pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Toxoplasma gondii, have been shown to contain microbial components and can promote antigen presentation and macrophage activation, suggesting that exosomes may function in immune surveillance. In this review, we summarize our understanding of exosome biogenesis but focus primarily on new insights into exosome function. We also discuss their possible use as disease biomarkers and vaccine candidates.","publish_time":"2008-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schorey, Jeffrey S.; Bhatnagar, Sanchita","journal":"Traffic","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e446b2b5ecf45f921775a29cb99b41e546a858f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6ca52a5b6fc519abee71b0c05932bf42c06768ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3636814.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18331451/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3636814?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00734.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["composition of exosomes","exosome function","cells of hematopoietic","presentation of tumor antigens","T cells","regulation of exosome release","understanding of exosome biogenesis","new studies","source of tumor antigens","antigen presentation","extracellular release","new insights","Recent studies","non-hematopoietic origin","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","plasma membrane","various intra-cellular pathogens","bioactive vesicles\u2019","disease biomarkers","fusion of multi-vesicular bodies","newest family member","possible use","vaccine candidates","macrophage activation","Toxoplasma gondii","intraluminal vesicles","microbial components","intercellular communication","infectious agents","immune surveillance","prior work","review"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all children \u003C2 years old diagnosed with bronchiolitis at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana between May 2014 and April 2015, who were treated as outpatients (paediatric emergency department, PED group) or as inpatients in the standard hospital setting (WARD group) or in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU group). Detection of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swab was accomplished by RT\u2010PCR. Severity was assessed by Wang Respiratory Score and hospitalization longer than 24 hours. RESULTS: The study included 761 children. The three most frequently detected viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRV) and human bocavirus (hBoV) (57.5%, 272/473; 25.6%, 121/473; 18.4%, 87/473). Patient groups differed in Wang Respiratory Score for the severity of bronchiolitis (P \u003C 0.001). No differences regarding the causative viruses were found. There was a lower proportion of children with the presence of more than one virus in PICU group compared to other two groups (P = 0.017). The three groups significantly differed in age, birthweight, comorbidities, bronchodilator treatment and antibiotic usage. However, multiple regression analysis revealed that younger age and the use of antibiotics were associated with bronchiolitis severity defined as hospitalization for \u003E24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory syncytial virus, hRV and hBoV were the most frequently detected viruses. The majority of patients admitted to the PICU had only one virus detected. Younger age and the use of antibiotics were associated with bronchiolitis severity.","publish_time":"2018-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Praznik, Ajda; Vin\u0161ek, Ne\u017Ea; Prodan, Ana; Er\u010Dulj, Vanja; Pokorn, Marko; Mrvi\u010D, Tatjana; Paro, Darja; Krivec, Uro\u0161; Strle, Franc; Petrovec, Miroslav; \u017Dnidar\u0161i\u010D Er\u017Een, Marta; Grosek, \u0160tefan","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57da78ec8de4f8fd1761c46221d0e05872f14f1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6185887.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29944781/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12587","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WARD","Wang Respiratory Score","PICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bronchiolitis severity","severity of bronchiolitis","respiratory syncytial virus","PICU group","detected viruses","Detection of respiratory viruses","Wang Respiratory Score","PED group","WARD group","younger age","causative viruses","hRV","hBoV","use of antibiotics","hospitalization","Patient groups","hours","lower proportion of children","human rhinovirus","human bocavirus","paediatric emergency department","paediatric intensive care unit","RSV","comorbidities","bronchodilator treatment","nasopharyngeal swab","standard hospital setting","inpatients","birthweight","risk factors","retrospective chart review","University Medical Centre Ljubljana","Study\u0027s objective","antibiotic usage","outpatients","multiple regression analysis","presence","years old","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","AIM","PCR","RESULTS","majority of patients","differences"],"language":"en"},

These genes differ distinctly among the three coronavirus groups and are specific for each group. While the essential genes encode replication and structural functions, hardly anything is known about the products and functions of the group-specific genes. As a first step to elucidate their significance, we deleted the group-specific genes from the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome via a novel targeted recombination system based on host switching (L. Kuo, G. J.Godeke, M. J. Raamsman, P. S. Masters, and P. J. M. Rottier, 2000, J. Virol. 74, 1393\u20131406). Thus, we obtained recombinant viruses from which the two clusters of group-specific genes were deleted either separately or in combination in a controlled genetic background. As all recombinant deletion mutant viruses appeared to be viable, we conclude that the MHV group-specific genes are nonessential, accessory genes. Importantly, all deletion mutant viruses were attenuated when inoculated into their natural host, the mouse. Therefore, deletion of the coronavirus group-specific genes seems to provide an attractive approach to generate attenuated live coronavirus vaccines.","publish_time":"2002-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Haan, Cornelis A.M.; Masters, Paul S.; Shen, Xiaolan; Weiss, Susan; Rottier, Peter J.M.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a493c956f4507616c4ace2c2c2cdcae494c931a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682202914121; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682202914121","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["G.

Additionally, 80% of respondents reported use of a risk assessment tool to determine whether CDC should be notified of possible public health emergencies. These findings suggest that most states have systems in place to ensure compliance with IHR. However, full state-level compliance will require additional efforts.","publish_time":"2010-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Armstrong, Kia E.; McNabb, Scott J.

Infection by its causative agent PED virus (PEDV), an Alpha-coronavirus, was previously proven to be mediated by its spike (S) glycoprotein and a cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN). Interestingly, some recent studies have indicated that pAPN is not a functional receptor for PEDV. To date, there is a lack of a direct evidence for the interaction between pAPN and PEDV S protein in vitro. Here, we prepared pAPN ectodomain and the truncated variants of PEDV S protein in Drosophila S2 cells. These recombinant proteins were homogeneous after purification by metal-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. We then assayed the purified target proteins through immunogenicity tests, PEDV binding interference assays, circular dichroism (CD) measurements, pAPN activity assay and structural determination, demonstrating that they were biologically functional. Finally, we characterized their interactions by gel filtration chromatography, native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses. The results showed that their affinities were too low to form complexes, which suggest that pAPN may be controversial as the genuine receptor for PEDV. Therefore, further research needs to be carried out to elucidate the interaction between PEDV and its genuine receptor.","publish_time":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Yan-gang; Li, Rui; Jiang, Longguang; Qiao, Songlin; Zhi, Yubao; Chen, Xin-xin; Xie, Sha; Wu, Jiawei; Li, Xuewu; Deng, Ruiguang; Zhang, Gaiping","journal":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8152688db9f76350e5e1667f66656968eb5474d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112428.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29802920/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813018305300; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813018305300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pAPN ectodomain","genuine receptor","functional receptor","truncated variants of PEDV S protein","pAPN activity assay","PEDV binding interference assays","cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N","gel filtration chromatography","recombinant proteins","size-exclusion chromatography","purified target proteins","native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","causative agent PED virus","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea","CD","immunogenicity tests","circular dichroism","PAGE","measurements","surface plasmon resonance","purification","metal-affinity","huge economic losses","glycoprotein","Drosophila S2 cells","global pork industry","structural determination","affinities","SPR","analyses","Infection","interactions","form complexes","direct evidence","lack","Alpha-coronavirus","spike","recent studies","date","results","research"],"language":"en"},

We use simple mathematical models to describe this process with the aim to better understand the emergence of an epidemic resulting from such a mutation and the extent of measures that are needed to control it. The feared outbreak of a human\u2013human transmissible form of avian influenza leading to a global epidemic is the paradigm for this study. We extend the SIR approach to derive a deterministic and a stochastic formulation to describe the evolution of two classes of susceptible and infected states and a removed state, leading to a system of ordinary differential equations and a stochastic equivalent based on a Markov process. For the deterministic model, the contrasting timescale of the mutation process and disease infectiousness is exploited in two limits using asymptotic analysis in order to determine, in terms of the model parameters, necessary conditions for an epidemic to take place and timescales for the onset of the epidemic, the size and duration of the epidemic and the maximum level of the infected individuals at one time. Furthermore, the basic reproduction number R 0 is determined from asymptotic analysis of a distinguished limit. Comparisons between the deterministic and stochastic model demonstrate that stochasticity has little effect on most aspects of an epidemic, but does have significant impact on its onset particularly for smaller populations and lower mutation rates for representatively large populations. The deterministic model is extended to investigate a range of quarantine and vaccination programmes, whereby in the two asymptotic limits analysed, quantitative estimates on the outcomes and effectiveness of these control measures are established.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, C.

Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (\u003E 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p \u003C 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications. Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.

This information would be beneficial to adequately reorganize outpatient clinics and hospitals to provide the highest possible level of orthopaedic care to our patients in a safe and efficient manner. METHODS: A literature search was performed for relevant research articles. In addition, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the EU CDC and other government health agency websites were searched for any relevant information. In particular, interest was paid to strategies and advise on managing the orthopaedic patient flow during outpatient clinics as well as surgical procedures including the necessary safety measures, while still providing a high-quality patient experience. The obtained information is provided as a narrative review. RESULTS: There was not any specific literature concerning the organization of an outpatient clinic and surgical activities and the particular challenges in dealing with a high-volume practice, in the afterwave of a pandemic. CONCLUSION: As the COVID-19 crisis has abruptly halted most of the orthopaedic activities both in the outpatient clinic and the operating room, a progressive start-up scenario needs to be planned.

Aim To study the infection control practice in isolation facilities participating in the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases (EuroNHID) project. Methods A survey was conducted during 2009 of 48 isolation facilities caring for patients with HIDs in 16 European countries. Checklists and standard evaluation forms were used to collect and interpret data on hand hygiene, routine hygiene and disinfection, and waste management. Findings Forty percent of HIDs had no non-hand-operated sinks or alcohol-based antiseptic distributors, while 27% did not have procedures for routine hygiene, final disinfection, or safe discarding of non-disposable objects or equipment. There was considerable variation in the management of waste and in the training of housekeeping personnel. EuroNHID has developed recommendations for hand hygiene, disinfection, routine hygiene, and waste management. Conclusions Most aspects of hand hygiene, routine hygiene and disinfection, and waste management were considered at least partially adequate in the majority of European isolation facilities dedicated for the care of patients with HIDs.

As such, multiplexed PCR assays have become standard in many virology laboratories. Objectives To compare the Seeplex RV15 (test of record) with two newer generation multiplex assays, the Anyplex II RV16 and the xTAG respiratory virus panels. Study design Two hundred and three retrospective and 36 prospective respiratory samples were tested by all three assays. Samples were deemed to be positive if they tested positive for a virus by at least two of the three respective assays. Negative samples also had to test negative by at least two of the three assays. Inconclusive samples were those that showed band signal intensity between 0 and 100 on the RV15, but had not been previously tested on the RV16 or xTAG. Results and conclusions Overall sensitivity and specificity of all three assays were similar (\u223C85% and 100%, respectively). Given each assay can identify multiple different viruses, the targets reported by one assay did not always agree with each target from another assay. Partial discordant rates were 47% and 21% for positive and negative samples, respectively. These higher than expected partial discordant rates may be due to primer or chemistry differences amongst the three multiplex assays.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radko, Sandi; Ian Stuart, J.; Zahariadis, George","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/959d8935abcf690af4f8da73a0490af21c4de06d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119489.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609341630622X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609341630622X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633962/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respective assays","Negative samples","prospective respiratory samples","multiplexed PCR assays","Inconclusive samples","newer generation multiplex assays","xTAG respiratory virus panels","RV16","Partial discordant rates","Abstract Background Timely identification of respiratory virus infection","test of record","Seeplex RV15","infection control procedures","Anyplex","appropriate treatment","specificity","inappropriate antibiotic use","conclusions Overall sensitivity","Results","multiple different viruses","targets","primer","chemistry differences","band signal intensity","virology laboratories","Study design","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

We observed that EV71 infection induced an early activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. The activity of GSK3\u03B2, a downstream target of these pathways, was negatively regulated by the activation of both MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. The phosphorylation of GSK3 could be inhibited by treatment with the specific inhibitors of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. Other Akt downstream targets, BAD, caspase-9 and the Forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), were not phosphorylated during the course of infection by EV71. We further demonstrated that infection by UV-irradiated, inactivated virus triggered early Akt activation but was insufficient to trigger late Akt activation. These data suggest that with the phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt the subsequent inactivation of GSK3\u03B2 is utilized by EV71 as a potential mechanism to delay host cell apoptosis.","publish_time":"2005-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Wen-Rou; Chen, Yu-Yun; Yang, Shun-Min; Chen, Yin-Li; Horng, Jim-Tong","journal":"Life Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094582.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094582/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAPK/ERK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early Akt activation","PI3K","ERK","late Akt activation","EV71 infection","Akt downstream targets","early activation","phosphorylation of MAPK","anti-apoptotic pathways","host cell apoptosis","specific inhibitors of MAPK","anti-apoptotic activity","activity of GSK3\u03B2","course of infection","phosphorylation of GSK3","subsequent inactivation of GSK3\u03B2","caspase","inactivated virus","potential mechanism","treatment","order","phosphatidylinositol","kinase","Forkhead transcription factor","FKHR","UV","mechanisms","enterovirus","data","Viruses"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between ventilatory settings during ECMO for refractory hypoxemia and outcome in ARDS patients. METHODS: In this individual patient data meta-analysis of observational studies in adult ARDS patients receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia, a time-dependent frailty model was used to determine which ventilator settings in the first 3 days of ECMO had an independent association with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Nine studies including 545 patients were included. Initiation of ECMO was accompanied by significant decreases in tidal volume size, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), plateau pressure, and driving pressure (plateau pressure \u2212 PEEP) levels, and respiratory rate and minute ventilation, and resulted in higher PaO(2)/FiO(2), higher arterial pH and lower PaCO(2) levels. Higher age, male gender and lower body mass index were independently associated with mortality. Driving pressure was the only ventilatory parameter during ECMO that showed an independent association with in-hospital mortality [adjusted HR, 1.06 (95 % CI, 1.03\u20131.10)]. CONCLUSION: In this series of ARDS patients receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia, driving pressure during ECMO was the only ventilator setting that showed an independent association with in-hospital mortality.

In the past decade, new data have emerged about VAP epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention. RESULTS: Classifying VAP strictly based on time since hospitalization (early- and late-onset VAP) can potentially result in undertreatment of drug-resistant organisms in ICUs with a high rate of drug resistance, and overtreatment for patients not infected with resistant pathogens. A combined strategy incorporating diagnostic scoring systems, such as the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), and either a quantitative or qualitative microbiological specimen, plus serial measurement of biomarkers, leads to responsible antimicrobial stewardship. The newly proposed ventilator-associated events (VAE) surveillance definition, endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing VAP and the ability to prevent VAE is uncertain, making it a questionable surrogate for the quality of ICU care. The use of adjunctive aerosolized antibiotic treatment can provide high pulmonary concentrations of the drug and may facilitate shorter durations of therapy for multi-drug-resistant pathogens. A group of preventive strategies grouped as a \u2018ventilator bundle\u2019 can decrease VAP rates, but not to zero, and several recent studies show that there are potential barriers to implementation of these prevention strategies. CONCLUSION: The morbidity and mortality related to VAP remain high and, in the absence of a gold standard test for diagnosis, suspected VAP patients should be started on antibiotics based on recommendations per the 2005 ATS guidelines and knowledge of local antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Using a combination of clinical severity scores, biomarkers, and cultures might help with reducing the duration of therapy and achieving antibiotic de-escalation.","publish_time":"2014-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nair, Girish B.; Niederman, Michael S.","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b20d8c940c2787ae4b8b9705b878b60732900f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095124.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095124/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzU2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score","VAP","VAE","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VAP epidemiology","diagnosing VAP","VAP rates","suspected VAP patients","late-onset VAP","undertreatment of drug","multi-drug-resistant pathogens","prevention strategies","high rate of drug resistance","high pulmonary concentrations","diagnosis","antibiotic de-escalation","Ventilator-associated pneumonia","VAE","resistant organisms","ventilator bundle","Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score","proposed ventilator-associated events","use of adjunctive aerosolized antibiotic treatment","duration of therapy","care resources","knowledge of local antibiotic susceptibility patterns","serial measurement of biomarkers","shorter durations of therapy","quality of ICU care","group of preventive strategies","combination of clinical severity scores","common cause of nosocomial infection","low sensitivity","gold standard test","specificity","ICUs","ATS guidelines","qualitative microbiological specimen","diagnostic scoring systems","Centers","potential barriers","surveillance definition","new data","CPIS","ability","overtreatment","questionable surrogate","Disease Control","significant utilization of health","combined strategy","cultures","absence","implementation","mortality","responsible antimicrobial stewardship","past decade","recommendations","hospitalization","morbidity","INTRODUCTION","antibiotics","recent studies","CONCLUSION","time","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Retrospective charts review. SETTING: A tertiary paediatric intensive care unit. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Infants with respiratory failure due to RSV infection. INTERVENTION: HFOV. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Pattern of lung disease, ventilatory settings, blood gases, infant\u2019s vital parameters, sedation and analgesia during the periods of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV, 6 infants), after initiation of HFOV (HFOVi, 9 infants), in the middle of its course (HFOVm), at the end (HFOVe) and after extubation (Post-Extub) were compared. All infants showed a predominant overexpanded lung pattern. Mean airway pressure was raised from a mean (SD) 12.5 (2.0) during CMV to 18.9 (2.7) cmH(2)O during HFOVi (P \u003C 0.05), then decreased to 11.1(1.3) at HFOVe (P \u003C 0.05). Mean FiO(2) was reduced from 0.68 (0.18) (CMV) to 0.59 (0.14) (HFOVi) then to 0.29 (0.06) (P \u003C 0.05) at HFOVe and mean peak to peak pressure from 44.9 (12.4) cmH(2)O (HFOVi) to 21.1 (7.7) P \u003C 0.05 (HFOVe) while mean (SD) PaCO(2) showed a trend to decrease from 72 (22) (CMV) to 47 (8) mmHg (HFVOe) and mean infants respiratory rate a trend to increase from 20 (11) (HFOVi) to 34 (14) (HFOVe) breaths/min. With usual doses of sedatives and opiates, no infant was paralysed and all were extubated to CPAP or supplemental oxygen after a mean of 120 h.

In this context the estimated use of the patient\u2019s physiologic tolerance to anemia enables 1) the tolerance of larger blood losses (loss of \u201Cdiluted blood\u201D), 2) the onset of transfusion to the time after surgical control of bleeding to be delayed and 3) the perioperative collection of autologous red blood cells. The present review article summarizes the mechanisms, influencing factors and limits of this natural tolerance to anemia and deduces the indication for perioperative red blood cell transfusion. Under strictly controlled conditions (anesthesia, normovolemia, complete muscular relaxation, hyperoxemia, mild hypothermia) extremely low hemoglobin concentrations [Hb \u003C3 g/dl (\u003C1.86 mmol/l)] are tolerated without transfusion by individuals with no cardiopulmonary disease. In the clinical routine these situations are limited to borderline situations e.g. unexpected massive blood losses in Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses or unexpected shortcomings in blood supply. The current recommendations coincide to the effect that perioperative red blood cell transfusion 1) is unnecessary up to a Hb concentration of 10 g/dl (6.21 mmol/l) even in older patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidity and 2) is only recommended in cases of Hb \u003C6 g/dl (\u003C3.72 mmol/l) in otherwise healthy subjects including pregnant women and children. Critically ill patients with multiple trauma and sepsis do not seem to benefit from transfusions up to Hb concentrations \u003E9 g/dl (\u003E5.59 mmol/l). In cases of massive hemorrhaging and diffuse bleeding disorders the maintenance of a Hb concentration of 10 g/dl (6.21 mmol/l) seems to contribute to stabilization of coagulation.","publish_time":"2006-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Habler, O.; Meier, J.; Pape, A.; Kertscho, H.; Zwi\u00DFler, B.","journal":"Anaesthesist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/145e9b486f348690319f39befafabf0f3744c7dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095856.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095856/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzcxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mmol","perioperative red blood cell transfusion","blood supply","diluted blood","transfusion medicine","treatment of transfusion","onset of transfusion","Hb concentrations","cases of Hb","unexpected massive blood losses","tolerance of larger blood losses","perioperative collection of autologous red blood cells","socio-economic significance of specific institutional transfusion programs","natural tolerance","anemia","patient\u2019s physiologic tolerance","cases of massive hemorrhaging","unexpected shortcomings","borderline situations","ill patients","older patients","cardiopulmonary comorbidity","cardiopulmonary disease","diffuse bleeding disorders","low hemoglobin concentrations","surgical control of bleeding","Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses","mild hypothermia","normovolemia","complete muscular relaxation","hyperoxemia","effect","indication","anesthesia","imbalance","donors","maintenance","potential recipients","associated complications","mechanisms","factors","estimated use","limits","time","healthy subjects","expected cost explosion","pregnant women","children","multiple trauma","sepsis","controlled conditions","present review article","context","individuals","current recommendations","clinical routine","transfusions","stabilization of coagulation"],"language":"en"},

While the virus is still being eliminated, the second phase of the disease begins, which is characterized by autoimmune phenomena and often a cardiac inflammatory response which likewise correlates with a worsening prognosis. The transition to the third and final phase with development of dilated cardiomyopathy occurs gradually and can take years.

The RAAS was originally thought to be an endocrine system critically important in regulating blood pressure homeostasis. Yet, important local forms of the RAAS have been described in many tissues, which are mostly independent of the systemic RAAS. These systems have been associated with diverse physiological functions, but also with inflammation, fibrosis and target-organ damage. Pharmacological modulation of the RAAS has brought about important advances in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Yet, traditional RAAS blockers such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) only reduce the risk of disease progression in patients with established cardiovascular or renal disease by \u223C20% compared with other therapies. As more components of the RAAS are described, other potential therapeutic targets emerge, which could provide improved cardiovascular and renal protection beyond that provided by an ACE inhibitor or ARB.

We used applied thematic analysis to identify recurrent and unique themes.

METHODS: Medical charts were reviewed for all full-term infants (gestational age \u003E 36 weeks) that were born in our institution during a 5-year period (from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2002) and that developed definite NEC. Data regarding the rate of Cesarean section (CS) in our institution over the study period and five years prior to the study was also recorded. RESULTS: During the 5 years of the study, 14 full-term infants were found to have NEC. The incidence of NEC in full-term infants increased from 0.16 to 0.71 per 1000 live births in the 5-year period. Mean birth weight was 2829 g. All the NEC infants except one were delivered by CS, and all of them were fed either with a mixture of breast milk and formula or entirely by formula. Seven of the infants (50%) had no major known risk factors predisposing them for NEC. Mean age of disease onset was very early (4.1 days) in most of the infants (12 infants), and the colon was the main NEC site. The short-term outcome was favorable in all but one case, which required explorative laparotomy for intestinal perforation. The number of infants born by CS has been steadily increasing, and was almost three times greater during the study period in comparison to the preceding years. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of NEC in the full-term population seems to differ from the etiology for the preterm group in its intestinal location and in the timing of its onset.

Several enteric coronaviruses have been identified that are associated with diarrhea in swine and that have caused substantial economic losses. In this study, a newly emerged porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV), PEAV-GD-CH/2017, was identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in southern China, and a full-length genome sequence of PEAV was obtained for systematic analysis. The novel PEAV sequence was most identical to that of bat-HKU2, and the differences between them were comprehensively compared, especially the uniform features of the S protein, which was shown to have a close relationship with betacoronaviruses and to perhaps represent unrecognized betacoronaviruses. In addition, Bayesian analysis was conducted to address the origin of PEAV, and the divergence time between PEAV and bat-HKU2 was estimated at 1926, which indicates that PEAV is not newly emerged and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades since the interspecies transmission of this coronavirus from bat to swine. The evolutionary rate of coronaviruses was estimated to be 1.93 \u00D7 10(\u22124) substitutions per site per year for the RdRp gene in our analysis. For the origin of PEAV, we suspect that it is the result of the interspecies transmission of bat-HKU2 from bat to swine. Our results provide valuable information about the uniform features, origin and evolution of the novel PEAV, which will facilitate further investigations of this newly emerged pathogen.","publish_time":"2018-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Xinliang; Fang, Bo; Liu, Yixing; Cai, Mengkai; Jun, Junming; Ma, Jun; Bu, Dexin; Wang, Lifang; Zhou, Pei; Wang, Heng; Zhang, Guihong","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1bb28f5ec512dd9cacffd54b6e8dd6646fe4fc5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106130.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818302107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704627/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.04.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818302107","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["origin of PEAV","PEAV-GD","novel PEAV sequence","bat-HKU2","full-length genome sequence of PEAV","interspecies transmission of bat","swine herds","enteric coronaviruses","uniform features","emerged pathogen","diarrhea","systematic analysis","Bayesian analysis","emerged porcine enteric alphacoronavirus","evolutionary rate of coronaviruses","unrecognized betacoronaviruses","southern China","varying severity","variety of diseases","divergence time","valuable information","site","year","different animals","suckling piglets","RdRp gene","decades","wide host range","results","S protein","study","investigations","substantial economic losses","substitutions","close relationship","addition","differences"],"language":"en"},

The existence of homologs of these enzymes in invertebrates indicates that these enzyme systems are highly conserved during evolution.

Viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV presenting a clear unmet medical need. Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of RNA virus families including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae, through the targeting of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family. Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC50 values. Of known CoVs, the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent RdRp as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the RdRp that confers resistance in beta-CoVs. Nevertheless, RDV is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). These data further extend the known breadth and antiviral activity of RDV to include both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic CoV and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging CoV.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brown, Ariane J.; Won, John J.; Graham, Rachel L.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Sims, Amy C.; Feng, Joy Y.; Cihlar, Tomas; Denison, Mark R.; Baric, Ralph S.; Sheahan, Timothy P.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41b254bddd56c6c09608a64652ba61eefeb9159e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6699884.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354219300993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233808/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104541; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354219300993","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["CoV"],"organizations":["RDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV family","potent antiviral activity of RDV","breadth of RDV antiviral activity","MERS-CoV","potent activity","divergent zoonotic CoV","future emerging CoV","known CoVs","divergent RdRp","known breadth","endemic human CoVs OC43","contemporary human","HCoV-OC43","porcine members","porcine deltacoronavirus","beta-CoVs","viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase","array of RNA virus families","disease emergence","probability of emergence","deltacoronavirus genus","diverse Orthocoronavirinae","cross species transmission","Filoviridae","Paramyxoviridae","epidemic strains","adenosine analog","domestic animals","native residue","targeting","clear unmet medical need","monophosphoramidate prodrug","humans","Pneumoviridae","resistance","SARS","submicromolar EC50 values","Viruses similar","livestock","PDCoV","GS","approved therapeutics","multiple assays","Remdesivir","data"],"language":"en"},

The mechanism of how picornavirus infection interferes with ERAD remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection significantly inhibits cellular ERAD by targeting multiple key ERAD molecules with its proteases 2A(pro) and 3C(pro) using different mechanisms. Ubc6e was identified as the key E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in EV71 disturbed ERAD. EV71 3C(pro) cleaves Ubc6e at Q219G, Q260S, and Q273G. EV71 2A(pro) mainly inhibits the de novo synthesis of key ERAD molecules Herp and VIMP at the protein translational level. Herp differentially participates in the degradation of different glycosylated ERAD substrates \u03B1-1 antitrypsin Null Hong Kong (NHK) and the C-terminus of sonic hedgehog (SHH-C) via unknown mechanisms. p97 was identified as a host factor in EV71 replication; it redistributed and co-exists with the viral protein and other known replication-related molecules in EV71-induced replication organelles. Electron microscopy and multiple-color confocal assays also showed that EV71-induced membranous vesicles were closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the ER membrane molecule RTN3 was redistributed to the viral replication complex during EV71 infection. Therefore, we propose that EV71 rearranges ER membranes and hijacks p97 from cellular ERAD to benefit its replication.

We estimated the point prevalence of Pneumocystis pneumonia in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients according to the number of R-CHOP cycles and investigated whether cytoreduction by chemotherapy is associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia development. We retrospectively established a cohort of patients who received R-CHOP for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in our institution. Using this cohort, we estimated the incidence rate and point prevalence of definite and probable Pneumocystis pneumonia. To assess factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia development several clinical variables, including absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte count at the time of non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis and when the last R-CHOP cycle was administered, were compared between patients with and without Pneumocystis pneumonia. Of 713 patients in the cohort, 14 and 18 patients were diagnosed with definite and probable Pneumocystis pneumonia, respectively. The overall incidence of definite and definite plus probable PCP in NHL patients receiving R-CHOP were 2.0 % (14/713; 95 % CI, 1.1\u20133.3 %) and 4.5 % (32/713; 95 % CI, 3.2\u20136.4 %), respectively. This corresponded to 3.8 (95 % CI, 2.2\u20136.4) and 8.4 (95 % CI, 5.9\u201311.9) per 1000 persons. Many cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia (22/32, 68.7 %) developed after administration of the fourth R-CHOP cycle. However, there was no statistical difference in Pneumocystis pneumonia prevalence between patients receiving four or more cycles of R-CHOP and fewer than. Higher absolute neutrophil count (4,742/mm(3) vs. 2,627/mm(3); p \u003C 0.01) was associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia development at the last R-CHOP cycle, while absolute lymphocyte count at the time of NHL diagnosis was not. Contrary to expectations, Pneumocystis pneumonia is not a frequent complication of R-CHOP treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cytoreduction of R-CHOP might not be a risk factor of Pneumocystis pneumonia development.

The IBV strains circulating in poultry farms are serotypes/genotypes Italy02 and Massachusetts (Mass) identified during 2010\u201314. The appearance of these variants hinders the prophylactic strategy carried out by the breeders of the Moroccan poultry farm. To solve this problem, we have opted for the rational design of candidate vaccines in order to study the structure of the three-dimensional (3D) S1 spicule protein of serotype Italy02 and Mass H120, through molecular modeling, using the I-TASSER server, then the COACH, and another Meta server to determine and predict the common immunogenic active sites between these two IBV strains circulating in Morocco. The obtained results showed that the two strains studied had identical spatial conformation of the S1 protein structure with a similarity percentage of 81% and an average stability of the modeled sequences. Thus both serotypes share active antigenic sites common in the hypervariable region, located at residues 229, 230, 232, 233, and 235, with a magnesium molecule association around the Alanine 280 region responsible for stimulating immunogenicity. The quality of the 3D conformation, the stability, and the percentage make it possible to have accessibility to the common predicted neutralizing epitopes. Based on these data, we can conclude that it is highly probable that the H120 vaccine strain confers cross-protection against a challenge with new strains Italy02 circulating in Morocco.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khataby, Khadija; Kasmi, Yassine; Souiri, Amal; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a123e8abb706d839b3b9c2cb0d7bb1229d406c1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149332.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128149669000044; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128149669000044","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV strains","new strains Italy02","Morocco","genotypes Italy02","active antigenic sites common","S1 protein structure","Mass H120","common immunogenic active sites","emergence of new serotypes","D conformation","variants","S1 spicule protein of serotype Italy02","hypervariable region","poultry farms","region responsible","common predicted neutralizing epitopes","antigenic diversity","similarity percentage","average stability","Meta server","H120 vaccine strain","identical spatial conformation","Moroccan poultry farm","I-TASSER server","Alanine","epidemiological situation of infectious bronchitis virus","accessibility","cross-protection","breeders","order","molecular modeling","challenge","rational design of candidate vaccines","magnesium molecule association","COACH","Massachusetts","prophylactic strategy","modeled sequences","immunogenicity","Abstract","appearance","residues","obtained results","quality","data","problem"],"language":"en"},

Here we report highly conserved potential G-quadruplex motifs (PGQs) in three essential genes (espK, espB, and cyp51) among 160 strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. Products of these genes are involved in pathways that are responsible for virulence determination of bacteria inside the host cell and its survival by maintaining membrane fluidity. The espK and espB genes are essential players that prevent the formation of mature phagolysosome and antigen presentation by host macrophages. The cyp51 is another PGQ-possessing gene involved in sterol biosynthesis pathway and membrane formation. In the present study, we revealed the formation of stable intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures by Mycobacterium PGQs using a combination of techniques (NMR, circular dichroism [CD], and gel electrophoresis). Next, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and CD melting analysis demonstrated that a well-known G-quadruplex ligand, TMPyP4, binds to and stabilizes these PGQ motifs. Finally, polymerase inhibition and qRT-PCR assays highlight the biological relevance of PGQ-possessing genes in this pathogen and demonstrate that G-quadruplexes are potential drug targets for the development of effective anti-tuberculosis therapeutics.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mishra, Subodh Kumar; Shankar, Uma; Jain, Neha; Sikri, Kriti; Tyagi, Jaya Sivaswami; Sharma, Tarun Kumar; Mergny, Jean-Louis; Kumar, Amit","journal":"Mol Ther Nucleic Acids","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4998df4f550be136b50f7d4d6234e2cf916b583.json; document_parses/pdf_json/de3e0083918cb84a1b2df214b7cd898afbe12206.json; document_parses/pdf_json/665622d28864a2df5caf4f9fdb8ebe97a0aedd8b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4691859fba97c59b688292d6d2132d3ef1510e3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6531831.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2019.04.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2162253119300952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128421/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2162253119300952","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PGQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conserved potential G-quadruplex motifs","G-quadruplexes","essential genes","espB genes","PGQ motifs","well-known G-quadruplex ligand","membrane formation","formation of stable intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures","Mycobacterium PGQs","potential drug targets","CD","conserved drug targets","Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome","biological relevance of PGQ","espK","cyp51","formation of mature phagolysosome","essential players","host cell","host macrophages","present study","membrane fluidity","genome of different organisms","various biological processes","development of effective anti-tuberculosis therapeutics","qRT-PCR assays","combination of techniques","antigen presentation","virulence determination of bacteria","sterol biosynthesis pathway","ITC","circular dichroism","NMR","polymerase inhibition","pathways","survival","analysis","strains","TMPyP4","pathogen","isothermal titration calorimetry","gel electrophoresis","Products"],"language":"en"},

One of the most important strategies for the development of effective new vaccines is the selection and usage of a suitable adjuvant. Immunologic adjuvants are essential for enhancing vaccine potency by improvement of the humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response to vaccine antigens. Thus, formulation of vaccines with appropriate adjuvants is an attractive approach towards eliciting protective and long-lasting immunity in humans. However, only a limited number of adjuvants is licensed for human vaccines due to concerns about safety and toxicity. We summarize current knowledge about the potential benefits of adjuvants, the characteristics of adjuvants and the mechanisms of adjuvants in human vaccines. Adjuvants have diverse modes of action and should be selected for use on the basis of the type of immune response that is desired for a particular vaccine. Better understanding of current adjuvants will help exploring new adjuvant formulations and facilitate rational design of vaccines against infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2015-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sujin; Nguyen, Minh Trang","journal":"Immune Netw","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c63f31f1d46c5a3cd4d4f2baeab9ce8c3a1dd3bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4411509.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25922593/; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2015.15.2.51","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human vaccines","strong vaccines","existing vaccines","formulation of vaccines","characteristics of adjuvants","appropriate adjuvants","mechanisms of adjuvants","Immunologic adjuvants","development of effective new vaccines","rational design of vaccines","great success of vaccines","potential benefits of adjuvants","limited number of adjuvants","Better understanding of current adjuvants","infectious pathogens","emerging new pathogens","new adjuvant formulations","vaccine potency","old pathogens","infectious diseases","vaccine antigens","particular vaccine","type of immune response","development of safe","suitable adjuvant","current knowledge","attractive approach","selection","usage","long-lasting immunity","order","improvement","basis","inadequate protection","cell","concerns","safety","cost-efficient method","important strategies","diverse modes of action","use","humans","toxicity"],"language":"en"},

A cattle population\u0027s environment includes its housing type, animal density, air quality, and exposure to mud or dust and other health antagonists such as parasites and stress; these environmental factors influence the innate immunity of a herd by their impact on immunosuppression. In addition, a herd\u0027s environment also dictates the \u201Canimal flow\u201D or contact and mixing patterns of potentially infectious and susceptible animals. Biosecurity is the attempt to keep infectious agents away from a herd, state, or country, and to control the spread of infectious agents within a herd. Infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, or parasites) alone are seldom able to cause disease in cattle without contributing factors from other infectious agents and/or the cattle\u0027s environment.

In mammals, multiple subtypes of interferon-\u03B1 (IFN-\u03B1) exist, most of which possess antiviral activity. Little is known about giant panda IFN-\u03B1 genes and the role they may play in giant panda immunological responses to viruses. We have cloned genes encoding 12 giant panda IFN-\u03B1 (AmIFN-\u03B1 or AmIFNA) subtypes that share from 90 to 99% amino acid sequence identity. AmIFN-\u03B112 has one additional amino acid at position 57, which is not present in other subtypes. Sequence identity of the AmIFN-\u03B1 proteins encoded by the 12 genes compared to human IFN-\u03B12 is approximately 58%. Unlike most of the human subtypes, each of the 12 giant panda IFN sequences has an N-glycosylation recognition site. Expression of all 12 AmIFN-\u03B1 subtypes in 293 cells was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. The antiviral activity and antiproliferative activity of each AmIFN-\u03B1 subtype produced in transiently transfected 293 cell cultures were tested in vitro. All AmIFN-\u03B1 subtypes were found to be stable at pH 2 or 65\u00B0C and to exhibit antiviral activity. Some IFN subtypes (AmIFN-\u03B18 and AmIFN-\u03B14) showed higher biological activity levels than others, whereas AmIFN-\u03B111 exhibited lower activity. AmIFN-\u03B1 had various antiproliferative activities to different target cells. To B16 cells, AmIFN-\u03B13, AmIFN-\u03B14, AmIFN-\u03B18 had the highest activities, while to K562 cells, AmIFN-\u03B13, AmIFN-\u03B17, AmIFN-\u03B110 had the highest activities. The various IFN-\u03B1 subtypes displayed a good correlation between their antiviral and antiproliferative potencies.","publish_time":"2007-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Xue-Mei; Tang, Yang; Yang, Yun-Fei; Song, Hong-Mei; Zhang, Yi-Zheng","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf80f0ee336a378cca9d2e08d63e7a80ca85bd52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112545.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589006007425; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589006007425","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["AmIFN-\u03B1 subtypes","AmIFN-\u03B1 proteins","AmIFN-\u03B14","AmIFN-\u03B13","AmIFN-\u03B18","AmIFN-\u03B110","AmIFN-\u03B17","AmIFN-\u03B112","AmIFN-\u03B111","IFN subtypes","various IFN-\u03B1 subtypes","giant panda IFN-\u03B1 genes","antiviral activity","human subtypes","giant panda IFN sequences","antiproliferative activity","lower activity","human IFN-\u03B12","multiple subtypes of interferon","giant panda immunological responses","various antiproliferative activities","K562 cells","B16 cells","highest activities","higher biological activity levels","different target cells","antiproliferative potencies","amino acid sequence identity","additional amino acid","good correlation","endangered species","SDS-PAGE","Ailuropoda melanoleuca","N-glycosylation recognition site","role","Western blotting analysis","viruses","AmIFNA","China","position","mammals","pH","Expression","cell cultures"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about the in vivo expression and functional regulation of this cellular factor. Here, we first assessed the SAMHD1 protein expression profile on a microarray of 25 human tissues from \u003E210 donors and in purified primary cell populations. In vivo, SAMHD1 was expressed in the majority of nucleated cells of hematopoietic origin, including tissue\u2010resident macrophages, DCs, pDCs, all developmental stages of thymic T cells, monocytes, NK cells, as well as at lower levels in B cells. Of note, SAMHD1 was abundantly expressed in HIV target cells residing in the anogenital mucosa, providing a basis for its evaluation as a cellular factor that may impact the efficiency of HIV transmission. Next, we examined the effect of the activation status and proinflammatory cytokine treatment of cells on expression and phosphorylation of SAMHD1. Activated, HIV\u2010susceptible CD4(\u002B) T cells carried pSAMHD1(T592), whereas resting CD4(\u002B) T cells and macrophages expressed the unphosphorylated protein with HIV\u2010restrictive activity.

In this study we evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 LDT for the NeuMoDx 96 system, a fully automated device performing extraction and real-time PCR. METHODS: A publicly available SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay was adapted for the automated system. Analytical performance was evaluated using in-vitro transcribed RNA and clinical performance was compared to the cobas 6800-based reference assay within the lab. RESULTS: The Envelope (E) Gene-LDT displayed good analytical performance with an LoD of 95.55 cp/ml and no false positives during evaluation of cross-reactivity. A total of 176 patient samples were tested with both the E-Gene-LDT and the reference assay. Positive and negative agreement were 100% and 99.2% respectively. Invalid-rate was 6.3%. CONCLUSION: The E-Gene-LDT showed analytical and clinical performance comparable to the cobas6800-based reference assay. Due to its random-access workflow concept and rapid time-to-result of about 80 minutes, the system is very well suited for providing fast-tracked SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics for urgent clinical samples in the hospital setting.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"N\u00F6rz, Dominik; Fischer, Nicole; Schultze, Alexander; Kluge, Stefan; Mayer-Runge, Ulrich; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Pfefferle, Susanne; L\u00FCtgehetmann, Marc","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2960ef3fe10a67912b05d95080f13eb380c066db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187839.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388471/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301323?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301323","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Gene-LDT","fast-tracked SARS-CoV","E-Gene","available SARS-CoV","ongoing SARS-CoV","clinical performance comparable","good analytical performance","cobas6800-based reference assay","automated system","urgent clinical samples","RT-PCR assay","fast-tracked rapid testing","rapid time","molecular diagnostics","automated device","urgent cases","real-time PCR","patient samples","pandemic","unique challenge","false positives","diagnostic laboratories","vitro transcribed RNA","evaluation of cross","clinicians","random-access workflow concept","cp","extraction","LoD","hospital setting","Envelope","NeuMoDx","large number of tests","Automation of workflows","reactivity","world","BACKGROUND","negative agreement","total","minutes","RESULTS","METHODS","CONCLUSION","study","Invalid-rate"],"language":"en"},

Discussions on the nature and limits of health care practitioners\u0027 duty to care during disasters and public health emergencies abounds the literature, ripe with arguments seeking to ground its foundations. However, to date there has been little public engagement on this issue. This study involved three Townhall meetings held between February 2008 and May 2010 in three urban settings in Canada in order to probe lay citizens\u0027 views about ethical issues related to pandemic influenza, including issues surrounding the duty to care. Participants included Canadian residents aged 18 and over who were fluent in English. Data were collected through day-long facilitated group discussions using case scenarios and focus group guides. Participant\u0027s views were organized according to several themes, including the following main themes (and respective sub-themes): 1. Legitimate limits; a) competing obligations; and b) appeal to personal choice; and 2. Legitimate expectations; a) reciprocity; and b) enforcement and planning. Our findings show that participants moved away from categorical notions of the duty to care towards more equivocal and often normative views throughout deliberations. Our analysis contributes a better understanding of the constitutive nature of the duty to care, defined in part by taking account of public views. This broadened understanding can further inform the articulation of acceptable norms of duty to care and policy development efforts. What is more, it illustrates the urgent need for policy-makers and regulators to get clarity on obligations, responsibilities, and accountability in the execution of HCPs\u0027 duty to care during times of universal vulnerability.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bensimon, C\u00E9cile M.; Smith, Maxwell J.; Pisartchik, Dmitri; Sahni, Sachin; Upshur, Ross E.G.","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f384dafc17c6833b03badc9bc4c9a5ab11e0218.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126096.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.09.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953612006843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23089615/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953612006843","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["nature of health care practitioners\u0027 duty","limits of health care practitioners\u0027 duty","execution of HCPs\u0027 duty","account of public views","articulation of acceptable norms of duty","normative views","Participant\u0027s views","public health emergencies","lay citizens\u0027 views","constitutive nature","obligations","Legitimate limits","Participants","following main themes","respective sub-themes","facilitated group discussions","little public engagement","ethical issues","policy-makers","group guides","better understanding","broadened understanding","Legitimate expectations","polarizing issue","policy development efforts","order","case scenarios","disasters","Canada","regulators","literature","accountability","pandemic influenza","responsibilities","clarity","reciprocity","appeal","day","urgent need","arguments","urban settings","enforcement","personal choice","date","times of universal vulnerability","deliberations","categorical notions","emergence of SARS","study","Townhall meetings","Canadian residents","planning","analysis","English","foundations","Data","findings"],"language":"en"},

The development of a safe and effective mucosal adjuvant and vaccine for prevention of emergent infectious diseases such as SARS will be an important advancement. PIKA, a stabilized derivative of Poly (I:C), was previously reported to be safe and potent as adjuvant in mouse models. In the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with this improved Poly (I:C) derivative induced strong anti-SARS-CoV mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses with neutralizing activity against pseudotyped virus. Although intraperitoneal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine alone could induce a certain level of neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites, co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with PIKA as adjuvant could induce a much higher neutralizing activity. When intranasal immunization was used, PIKA was obligatorily for inducing neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites and was correlated with both mucosal IgA and mucosal IgG response. Overall, PIKA could be a good mucosal adjuvant candidate for inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine for use in possible future pandemic.","publish_time":"2011-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gai, Wei-wei; Zhang, Yan; Zhou, Di-han; Chen, Yao-qing; Yang, Jing-yi; Yan, Hui-min","journal":"Virol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/456dd1fcd4e5ce47cc6be199ce8462f6213d814e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21468931/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-011-3183-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS Coronavirus","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS Coronavirus","intraperitoneal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine","strong anti-SARS-CoV mucosal","intranasal co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine","mucosal sites","effective mucosal adjuvant","mucosal IgA","PIKA","good mucosal adjuvant candidate","mucosal IgG response","higher neutralizing activity","certain level of neutralizing activity","serum","intranasal immunization","stabilized derivative of Poly","improved Poly","potent adjuvants","deadly infectious disease","possible future pandemic","prevention of emergent infectious diseases","systemic humoral immune responses","pseudotyped virus","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","economical needle-free vaccination","mouse models","development","important advancement","present study"],"language":"en"},

Model-based estimates for the basic reproduction number (R (0)) of ZIKV in affected Caribbean and Central and South American countries, obtained from 2015 to 2016 human case surveillance data, were compared by logistic regression and Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC), with the prevalence of ZIKV-positive test results in Canadians who travelled to them. RESULTS: Estimates of R (0) for each country were a good predictor of the ZIKV test result (ROC area under the curve = 0.83) and the odds of testing positive was 11-fold greater for travellers visiting countries with estimated R (0) \u2265 2.76, compared to those visiting countries with R (0) \u003C 2.76. CONCLUSIONS: Risk to travellers varies widely amongst countries affected by ZIKV outbreaks. Estimates of R (0) from surveillance data can assist in assessing levels of risk for travellers and may help improve travel advice.

Although the rates of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-resistant Haemophilus influenzae have risen to alarming levels, the rates of respiratory FQ (RFQ) resistance amongst these isolates remain relatively low. It is reported that ca. 1\u20137% of CAP cases are re-diagnosed as pulmonary TB in Asian countries. A longer duration (\u22657 days) of symptoms, a history of night sweats, lack of fever (\u003E38 \u00B0C), infection involving the upper lobe, presence of cavitary infiltrates, opacity in the lower lung without the presence of air, low total white blood cell count and the presence of lymphopenia are predictive of pulmonary TB. Amongst patients with CAP who reside in TB-endemic countries who are suspected of having TB, imaging studies as well as aggressive microbiological investigations need to be performed early on. Previous exposure to a FQ for \u003E10 days in patients with TB is associated with the emergence of FQ-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates. However, rates of M. tuberculosis isolates with FQ resistance are significantly higher amongst multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates than amongst susceptible isolates. Consequently, in Taiwan and also in other countries with TB endemicity, a short-course (5-day) regimen of a RFQ is still recommended for empirical therapy for CAP patients if the patient is at low risk for TB.","publish_time":"2012-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Gwan-Han; Tsao, Thomas Chang-Yao; Kao, Shang-Jyh; Lee, Jen-Jyh; Chen, Yen-Hsu; Hsieh, Wei-Chung; Hsu, Gwo-Jong; Hsu, Yen-Tao; Huang, Ching-Tai; Lau, Yeu-Jun; Tsao, Shih-Ming; Hsueh, Po-Ren","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7605794062b9052dca9c14d12c43706603523776.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127649.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2011.11.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857912000039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857912000039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22285045/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","RFQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TB endemicity","tuberculosis isolates","TB-endemic countries","predictive of pulmonary TB","CAP patients","emergence of FQ resistance","rates of respiratory FQ","high tuberculosis","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","possibility of delayed TB diagnosis","susceptible isolates","multidrug-resistant","Asian countries","CAP cases","presence of air","presence of lymphopenia","resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae","empirical therapy","RFQ","rates of macrolide","low risk","days","presence of cavitary infiltrates","clavulanic acid-resistant Haemophilus influenzae","low total white blood cell count","amoxicillin","treatment","alarming levels","upper lobe","lower lung","history of night sweats","opacity","FQs","community","short-course","imaging studies","lack of fever","symptoms","infection","aggressive microbiological investigations","role of fluoroquinolones","regimen","longer duration","Previous exposure","Taiwan"],"language":"en"},

Once expressed, \u03B1V\u03B26 moderates acute lung injury (ALI) through as yet undefined molecular mechanisms. We show that the upregulation of \u03B26 during influenza infection is involved in disease pathogenesis. \u03B26-deficient mice (\u03B26 KO) have increased survival during influenza infection likely due to the limited viral spread into the alveolar spaces leading to reduced ALI. Although the \u03B26 KO have morphologically normal lungs, they harbor constitutively activated lung CD11b(\u002B) alveolar macrophages (AM) and elevated type I IFN signaling activity, which we traced to the loss of \u03B26-activated transforming growth factor-\u03B2 (TGF-\u03B2). Administration of exogenous TGF-\u03B2 to \u03B26 KO mice leads to reduced numbers of CD11b(\u002B) AMs, decreased type I IFN signaling activity and loss of the protective phenotype during influenza infection. Protection extended to other respiratory pathogens such as Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia.

The high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in southern Africa necessitates the development of cheap, effective vaccines. One means of production is the use of plants, for which a number of different techniques have been successfully developed. HIV-1 Pr55Gag is a promising HIV-1 vaccine candidate: we compared the expression of this and a truncated Gag (p17/p24) and the p24 capsid subunit in Nicotiana spp. using transgenic plants and transient expression via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and recombinant tobamovirus vectors. We also investigated the influence of subcellular localisation of recombinant protein to the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on protein yield. We partially purified a selected vaccine candidate and tested its stimulation of a humoral and cellular immune response in mice. RESULTS: Both transient and transgenic expression of the HIV antigens were successful, although expression of Pr55Gag was low in all systems; however, the Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of p24 and p17/p24 yielded best, to more than 1 mg p24/kg fresh weight. Chloroplast targeted protein levels were highest in transient and transgenic expression of p24 and p17/p24. The transiently-expressed p17/p24 was not immunogenic in mice as a homologous vaccine, but it significantly boosted a humoral and T cell immune response primed by a gag DNA vaccine, pTHGagC. CONCLUSION: Transient agroinfiltration was best for expression of all of the recombinant proteins tested, and p24 and p17/p24 were expressed at much higher levels than Pr55Gag. Our results highlight the usefulness of plastid signal peptides in enhancing the production of recombinant proteins meant for use as vaccines. The p17/p24 protein effectively boosted T cell and humoral responses in mice primed by the DNA vaccine pTHGagC, showing that this plant-produced protein has potential for use as a vaccine.","publish_time":"2008-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyers, Ann; Chakauya, Ereck; Shephard, Enid; Tanzer, Fiona L; Maclean, James; Lynch, Alisson; Williamson, Anna-Lise; Rybicki, Edward P","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b7c700ee3a33c0a675a5f7e71a20ce62467b900.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2443125.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18573204/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6750-8-53","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["sub-Saharan Africa","southern Africa"],"keyphrases":["p24 protein","transient expression of p24","transgenic expression of p24","p17","expression of Pr55Gag","p24 capsid subunit","homologous vaccine","gag DNA vaccine","DNA vaccine pTHGagC","mice","protein yield","Transient agroinfiltration","HIV antigens","promising HIV","selected vaccine candidate","production of recombinant proteins","transgenic plants","Chloroplast targeted protein levels","use of plants","influence of subcellular localisation of recombinant protein","high prevalence of HIV","T cell immune response","Agrobacterium","humoral responses","boosted T cell","recombinant tobamovirus vectors","RESULTS","cellular immune response","truncated Gag","southern Africa","higher levels","means of production","sub-Saharan Africa","effective vaccines","subtype C","stimulation","Nicotiana","development of cheap","Human immunodeficiency virus type","endoplasmic reticulum","usefulness of plastid signal peptides","BACKGROUND","potential","systems","number of different techniques","people","CONCLUSION","fresh weight"],"language":"en"},

In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNA, this sequence element has a potential to form either a stem-loop or a pseudoknot structure. Based on many mutational studies, the stem-loop structure has been proposed for the downstream enhancer region of the HIV-1 mRNA. This stimulatory stem-loop structure is separated from the shift site by a spacer of seven nucleotides. In contrast, a recent report has proposed an alternative model in which the bases in the spacer sequence form a pseudoknot structure as the downstream enhancer sequence [Du et al., Biochemistry 35 (1996) 4187\u20134198.]. Using UV melting and enzymatic mapping analyses, we have investigated the conformation of the sequence region involved in ribosomal frameshifting in HIV-1. Our S1, V1, and T1 endonuclease mappings, together with UV melting analysis, clearly indicate that this sequence element of the HIV-1 mRNA frameshift site forms a stem-loop structure, not a pseudoknot structure. This finding further supports the stem-loop structure proposed by many mutational studies for the downstream enhancer sequence of the HIV-1 mRNA.","publish_time":"1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Hunseung","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3517177d654c706a71267c27e311ec2766537334.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167478198000049; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167478198000049","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjszODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spacer sequence","downstream enhancer sequence","sequence region","HIV","pseudoknot structure","stimulatory stem-loop structure","neighboring sequence elements","downstream enhancer region","mRNA frameshift site","mutational studies","UV","Abstract Programmed ribosomal frameshifting","viral messenger RNA","response","T1 endonuclease mappings","recent report","alternative model","V1","human immunodeficiency virus type","bases","enzymatic mapping analyses","S1","analysis","conformation","potential","contrast","nucleotides","Biochemistry"],"language":"en"},

Sphingosine 1-phosphate and its analogues cause internalization and degradation of S1P1 receptors, preventing the auto reactivity of immune cells in the target tissues. It has been shown that S1P1 receptor agonists such as fingolimod can be suitable candidates for treatment of autoimmune diseases. The current study aimed to generate GRIND-based 3D-QSAR predictive models for agonistic activities of 2-imino-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives on S1P1 to be used in virtual screening of chemical libraries. The developed model for the S1P1 receptor agonists showed appropriate power of predictivity in internal (r2 acc 0.93 and SDEC 0.18) and external (r2 0.75 and MAE (95% data), 0.28) validations. The generated model revealed the importance of variables DRY-N1 and DRY-O in the potency and selectivity of these compounds towards S1P1 receptor. To propose potential chemical entities with S1P1 agonistic activity, PubChem chemicals database was searched and the selected compounds were virtually tested for S1P1 receptor agonistic activity using the generated models, which resulted in four potential compounds with high potency and selectivity towards S1P1 receptor. Moreover, the affinities of the identified compounds towards S1P1 receptor were evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicated that the binding energies of the compounds were in the range of \u221239.31 to \u221246.18 and \u22123.20 to \u22129.75 kcal mol\u22121, calculated by MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA algorithms, respectively.

In explaining the WHO\u2019s failure, critics have pointed to structural restraints on the United Nations organisation and a leadership \u2018vacuum\u2019 in Geneva, among other factors. This paper takes a different approach. Drawing on internal WHO documents and interviews with key actors in the epidemic response, I argue that the WHO\u2019s failure is better understood as a consequence of Ebola\u2019s shifting medical identity and of triage systems for managing emerging infectious disease (EID) risks. Focusing on the discursive and non-discursive practices that produced Ebola as a \u2018problem\u2019 for global health security, I argue that by 2014 Ebola was no longer regarded as a paradigmatic EID and potential biothreat so much as a neglected tropical disease. The result was to relegate Ebola to the fringes of biosecurity concerns just at the moment when the virus was crossing international borders in West Africa and triggering large urban outbreaks for the first time. Ebola\u2019s fluctuating medical identity also helps explain the prominence of fear and rumours during the epidemic and social resistance to Ebola control measures.

Several studies have been conducted across the globe describing the importance of traditional knowledge in veterinary care. Therefore, this study was planned with the aim to record knowledge on ethnoveterinary practices from the remote areas and share sit with other communities through published literature. METHODS: Data was gathered from community members through semi-structured interviews and analyzed through informant consensus factor (Fic) to evaluate the consent of current ethnoveterinary practices among the local people. RESULTS: In total, 73 medicinal plants were recorded under the ethnoveterinary practices. Most widely used medicinal plants with maximum use reports (URs) were Visnaga daucoides Gaertn., Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Solanum virginianum L., Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, Glycyrrhiza glabra L., and Curcuma longa L. New medicinal values were found with confidential level of citations for species including Heracleum candicans and Glycerhiza glabra. Family Apiaceae was the utmost family with high number (7 species) of medicinal plants. Maximum number of medicinal plants (32) was used for gastric problems. High Fic was recorded for dermatological (0.97) followed by reproductive (0.93) and gastrointestinal disorders (0.92). The main route of remedies administration was oral. CONCLUSIONS: Current study revealed that the study area has sufficient knowledge on ethnoveterinary medicinal plants. This knowledge is in the custody of nomadic grazers, herders, and aged community members. Plants with new medicinal uses need to be validated phytochemically and pharmacologically for the development of new alternative drugs for veterinary purposes.","publish_time":"2018-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aziz, Muhammad Abdul; Khan, Amir Hasan; Adnan, Muhammad; Ullah, Habib","journal":"J Ethnobiol Ethnomed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa0a24c1abcfc2964ea0a8f4c4c3df322713eca7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5789696.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13002-018-0212-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378636/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bajaur Agency","Heracleum"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ethnoveterinary medicinal plants","Maximum number of medicinal plants","New medicinal values","new medicinal uses","sufficient knowledge","consent of current ethnoveterinary practices","Current study","species","importance of traditional knowledge","study area","high number","High Fic","aged community members","development of new alternative drugs","utmost family","natural remedies","Glycyrrhiza glabra","veterinary purposes","veterinary care","Family Apiaceae","Glycerhiza glabra","maximum use reports","main route of remedies administration","pastoral lifestyle of Indigenous communities of Bajaur Agency","URs","Foeniculum vulgare","Visnaga daucoides Gaertn","herders","semi-structured interviews","Curcuma longa","confidential level of citations","Heracleum candicans","Solanum virginianum","informant consensus factor","share","remote areas","custody of nomadic grazers","Withania somnifera","Dunal","globe","local people","aim","BACKGROUND","domestic animals","Data","total","published literature","gastrointestinal disorders","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","gastric problems","studies"],"language":"en"},

Based on genome size, they are far separated from all other ssRNA\u002B viruses (below 19.6 kb), including the distantly related Arteriviridae (12.7\u201315.7 kb; \u2018small nidoviruses\u2019). Exceptionally for ssRNA\u002B viruses, large nidoviruses encode a 3\u2032-5\u2032exoribonuclease (ExoN) that was implicated in controlling RNA replication fidelity. Its acquisition may have given rise to the ancestor of large nidoviruses, a hypothesis for which we here provide evolutionary support using comparative genomics involving the newly discovered first insect-borne nidovirus. This Nam Dinh virus (NDiV), named after a Vietnamese province, was isolated from mosquitoes and is yet to be linked to any pathology. The genome of this enveloped 60\u201380 nm virus is 20,192 nt and has a nidovirus-like polycistronic organization including two large, partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b followed by several smaller 3\u2032-proximal ORFs. Peptide sequencing assigned three virion proteins to ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3, which are expressed from two 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic RNAs. The NDiV ORF1a/ORF1b frameshifting signal and various replicative proteins were tentatively mapped to canonical positions in the nidovirus genome. They include six nidovirus-wide conserved replicase domains, as well as the ExoN and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase that are specific to large nidoviruses. NDiV ORF1b also encodes a putative N7-methyltransferase, identified in a subset of large nidoviruses, but not the uridylate-specific endonuclease that \u2013 in deviation from the current paradigm - is present exclusively in the currently known vertebrate nidoviruses. Rooted phylogenetic inference by Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods indicates that NDiV clusters with roniviruses and that its branch diverged from large nidoviruses early after they split from small nidoviruses. Together these characteristics identify NDiV as the prototype of a new nidovirus family and a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.","publish_time":"2011-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nga, Phan Thi; Parquet, Maria del Carmen; Lauber, Chris; Parida, Manmohan; Nabeshima, Takeshi; Yu, Fuxun; Thuy, Nguyen Thanh; Inoue, Shingo; Ito, Takashi; Okamoto, Kenta; Ichinose, Akitoyo; Snijder, Eric J.; Morita, Kouichi; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b67761a8689f2744b4046161187a0d128a5d7d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3169540.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21931546/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Maximum Likelihood"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ancestor of large nidoviruses","subset of large nidoviruses","small nidoviruses","vertebrate nidoviruses","large genomes","nidovirus genome","NDiV ORF1b","NDiV clusters","NDiV ORF1a","ssRNA","new nidovirus family","ExoN","genome size","nidovirus-wide conserved replicase domains","virion proteins","O-methyltransferase","nm virus","proximal ORFs","ORF1b frameshifting signal","various replicative proteins","putative N7-methyltransferase","uridylate-specific endonuclease","RNA replication fidelity","Nam Dinh virus","complex positive-sense single-stranded RNA","Maximum Likelihood methods","Bayesian","missing link","Rooted phylogenetic inference","prototype","transition","comparative genomics","canonical positions","deviation","roniviruses","open reading frames","rise","hypothesis","branch","evolutionary support","Peptide sequencing","current paradigm","Roniviridae","insect","polycistronic organization","Coronaviridae","Vietnamese province","coterminal subgenomic RNAs","mosquitoes","characteristics","related Arteriviridae","acquisition","exoribonuclease","pathology"],"language":"en"},

Cases were divided into 2 groups according to B. pertussis positive or negative. Clinical parameters, clinical severity scores and laboratory characteristics of the pertussis-positive and pertussis-negative cases were compared. RESULTS: Bordetella pertussis infection was detected in 44 (25.6%) of the 172 infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis, and as co-infection with respiratory viral agents in 27 (61.4%) infants. Of the 44 pertussis-positive infants, only 17 (38.6%) experienced a paroxysmal cough, 13 (29.5%) had whooping and 15 (34.1%) had post-tussive vomiting.

Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken using a piloted form. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated (i) pooled proportion of HCWs willing to work and (ii) pooled odds ratios of risk factors associated with willingness to work. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I(2) statistic, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger\u0027s test. Data were synthesized narratively where meta-analyses were not possible. Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of the proportion of HCWs willing to work was abandoned due to excessive heterogeneity (I(2) = 99\u00B72%). Narrative synthesis showed study estimates ranged from 23\u00B71% to 95\u00B78% willingness to work, depending on context.

Childcare obligations were significantly associated with decreased willingness. HCWs\u0027 willingness to work during an influenza pandemic was moderately high, albeit highly variable. Numerous risk factors showed a statistically significant association with willingness to work despite significant heterogeneity between studies. None of the included studies were based on appropriate theoretical constructs of population behaviour.","publish_time":"2015-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aoyagi, Yumiko; Beck, Charles R; Dingwall, Robert; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cf5055e0ca001204109a5455b58a42aaa79f431.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4415696.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25807865/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated risk factors","Meta-analyses of specific factors","decreased willingness","increased willingness","awareness of pandemic risk","Numerous risk factors","pooled proportion of HCWs willing","male HCWs","risk of bias assessments","meta-analysis compliant","pooled odds ratios of risk factors","Random-effects meta-analyses","significant heterogeneity","pandemic response training","included studies","excessive heterogeneity","clinical knowledge of influenza pandemics","role-specific knowledge","proportion of healthcare workers","personal safety","personal skills","significant association","publication bias","Data extraction","inclusion criteria","protocol eligibility criteria","full-time employment","nurses","physicians","systematic review","appropriate theoretical constructs of population behaviour","funnel plots","confidence","PRISMA guidance","Narrative synthesis","study estimates","Egger\u0027s test","records","statistic","piloted form","Childcare obligations","Databases","grey literature","context"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of CD4(\u002B)CD25(high)CD127(low/)(\u2212)Treg cells in MS patients. METHODS: The study population was composed of 25 healthy controls (HCs), 35 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and 25 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). Frequency of CD4(\u002B)CD25(high)CD127(low/)(\u2212) Treg cells in RRMS and PMS patients was compared with HC by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treg cells frequency in PMS patients was significantly higher compared to RRMS patients (P \u003C 0.001) and HCs (P \u003C 0.001). It was lower in RRMS patients than HCs (P = 0.005). A Significant direct correlation between Treg cells frequency and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) in PMS patients (P = 0.001, r = 0.6) was observed. Reverse correlation between Treg cells frequency and EDSS in RRMS patients was found (P = 0.01, r = \u22120.4).

After binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins or collectin 11 to carbohydrates or acetylated residues on pathogen surfaces, dimers of MBL-associated serine proteases 1 and 2 (MASP-1 and MASP-2) activate a proteolytic cascade, which culminates in the formation of the membrane attack complex and pathogen lysis. Alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding MASP-1 results in two other products, MASP-3 and MAp44, which regulate activation of the cascade. A similar mechanism allows the gene encoding MASP-2 to produce the truncated MAp19 protein. Polymorphisms in MASP1 and MASP2 genes are associated with protein serum levels and functional activity. Since the first report of a MASP deficiency in 2003, deficiencies in lectin pathway proteins have been associated with recurrent infections and several polymorphisms were associated with the susceptibility or protection to infectious diseases. In this review, we summarize the findings on the role of MASP polymorphisms and serum levels in bacterial, viral and protozoan infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beltrame, Marcia H.; Boldt, Angelica B.W.; Catarino, Sandra J.; Mendes, Hellen C.; Boschmann, Stefanie E.; Goeldner, Isabela; Messias-Reason, Iara","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bf853d3436f05746060ca8cc0ff18788784747a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112674.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25862418/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589015003491; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589015003491; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2015.03.245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MASP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of MASP polymorphisms","MASP deficiency","binding lectin","protein serum levels","lectin pathway proteins","protozoan infectious diseases","infectious organisms","associated serine proteases","dimers of MBL","pathogen surfaces","pivotal role","pathogen lysis","binding of mannan","proteolytic cascade","truncated MAp19 protein","carbohydrates","acetylated residues","MASP2 genes","membrane attack complex","collectin","pre-mRNA","complement system","ficolins","results","deficiencies","formation","defense","functional activity","susceptibility","findings","Alternative splicing","recurrent infections","MASP1","MAp44","similar mechanism","products","protection","activation","report","review"],"language":"en"},

DMY capsules have been sold in US as a nutraceutical supplement to prevent alcoholic hangovers. The major disadvantage associated with DMY is its chemical instability and poor bioavailability caused by the combined effects of its low solubility and poor membrane permeability. This limits its practical use in the food and pharmaceutical fields. SCOPE AND APPROACH: The present paper gives an overview of the current methods for the identification and quantification of DMY. Furthermore, recent findings regarding the main biological properties and chemical stability of DMY, the metabolism of DMY as well as different approaches to increase DMY bioavailability in both aqueous and lipid phases are discussed. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Current trends on identification and quantification of DMY have been focused on spectral and chromatographic techniques. Many factors such as heat, pH, metal ions, could affect the chemical stability of DMY. Despite the diverse biological effects of DMY, DMY faces with the problem of poor bioavailability. Utilization of different delivery systems including solid dispersion, nanocapsule, microemuslion, cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, co-crystallization, phospholipid complexes, and chemical or enzymatic acylation has the potential to improve both the solubility and bioavailability. DMY digested in laboratory animals undergoes reduction, dehydroxylation, methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation. Novel DMY delivery systems and basic pharmacokinetic studies of encapsulated DMY on higher animals and humans might be required in the future.","publish_time":"2019-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Dan; Mao, Yiqin; Ding, Lijun; Zeng, Xin-An","journal":"Trends Food Sci Technol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127391.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224417308142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288229/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924224417308142; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2019.07.038","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DMY"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DMY bioavailability","quantification of DMY","metabolism of DMY","DMY capsules","chemical stability of DMY","Novel DMY delivery systems","diverse biological effects of DMY","basic pharmacokinetic studies of encapsulated DMY","problem of poor bioavailability","chemical instability","identification","Utilization of different delivery systems","poor membrane permeability","phospholipid complexes","Current trends","higher animals","current methods","combined effects","low solubility","laboratory animals","different approaches","KEY FINDINGS","recent findings","neuroprotective activities","cyclodextrin inclusion complexes","main biological properties","nanocapsule","microemuslion","co-crystallization","solid dispersion","reduction","anti-inflammatory","antioxidant","antidiabetic","methylation","dehydroxylation","CONCLUSIONS","humans","present paper","metal ions","enzymatic acylation","important plant flavonoid","food","nutraceutical supplement","heat","glucuronidation","health","overview","potential","practical use","pharmaceutical fields","great attention","lipid phases","alcoholic hangovers","SCOPE","Dihydromyricetin","major disadvantage","chromatographic techniques"],"language":"en"},

Then, seven active constituents (astragaloside, calycosin, formononetin, cimicifugoside, 4-O-beta-d-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, sec-O-glucosylhamaudol, and atractylenolide II) derived from three medicinal plants were chosen to further investigate the pharmacokinetic behavior of YPF formula using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry system. The method was sensitive, accurate and reliable. We also used the area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve from zero to infinity (AUC(0\u2212\u221E)) as weighting factor to make an integrated pharmacokinetic curve.

Many elective and non-essential surgeries were postponed worldwide in an effort to minimize spread of disease as well as to conserve resources. Our goal with this article is to review current practice guidelines in setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on available data and literature. METHODS: Websites pertaining to surgical and medical societies, and government agencies were reviewed, along with recently published literature to identify recommendations related to COVID-19 and plastic surgery procedures. RESULTS: Clinical practice modifications are recommended during the pandemic, in outpatient and perioperative settings. Use of personal protective equipment is critical for aerosol generating procedures such as surgery in the head and neck area. Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic, however definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases. Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma and semi-urgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature. CONCLUSION: The risk and benefit of each reconstructive procedure should be carefully analyzed in relation to necessary patient care, minimized COVID-19 spread, protection of health care personnel and utilization of resources. Recommendations in this manuscript should be taken in the context of each institute\u2019s resources and prevalance of COVID-19 in the region.

Clinical effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent used was evaluated on the basis of clinical outcome as well as microbiological outcome of the trial. Body temperature, local pain, cough, change in sputum quality, peripheral white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, and chest radiograph were used as the parameters for the evaluation. To maintain the quality of specimens to be examined, Geckler\u0027s classification of specimens was used.

By conducting high-resolution CFD simulations, this paper investigates the evaporation and transport of solid-liquid mixed droplets (initial diameter 10 \u03BCm and 50 \u03BCm, solid to liquid ratio is 1:9) exhaled in a coach bus with 14 thermal manikins. Five air-conditioning supply directions and ambient relative humidity (RH = 35% and 95%) are considered. Results show that ventilation effectiveness, RH and initial droplet size significantly influence droplet transmissions in coach bus. 50 \u03BCm droplets tend to evaporate completely within 1.8 s and 7 s as RH = 35% and 95% respectively, while 0.2 s or less for 10 \u03BCm droplets. Thus 10 \u03BCm droplets diffuse farther with wider range than 50 \u03BCm droplets which tend to deposit more on surfaces. Droplet dispersion pattern differs due to various interactions of gravity, ventilation flows and the upward thermal body plume. The fractions of droplets suspended in air, deposited on wall surfaces are quantified. This study implies high RH, backward supply direction and passengers sitting at nonadjacent seats can effectively reduce infection risk of droplet transmission in buses. Besides taking masks, regular cleaning is also recommended since 85%-100% of droplets deposit on object surfaces.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Xia; Ou, Cuiyun; Yang, Hongyu; Liu, Li; Song, Tie; Kang, Min; Lin, Hualiang; Hang, Jian","journal":"J Hazard Mater","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc832e416472b2ca27df6e8c4f50c7ab8e7f6092.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389420305987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361671/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389420305987?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122609","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03BCm droplets","droplets deposit","fractions of droplets","droplet transmissions","liquid mixed droplets","initial droplet size","Droplet dispersion pattern","Abstract Droplet dispersion","high RH","infection risk of droplet transmission","coach bus","object surfaces","wall surfaces","ventilation flows","initial diameter","ventilation effectiveness","crowded buses","transport of solid","liquid ratio","thermal manikins","backward supply direction","air-conditioning supply directions","transmissions of respiratory infectious diseases","upward thermal body plume","bacteria","various interactions of gravity","ambient relative humidity","passengers","viruses","nonadjacent seats","paper","evaporation","wider range","study","influencing mechanisms","high-resolution CFD simulations","Results","masks","regular cleaning"],"language":"en"},

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an economically significant coronavirus that can cause severe diarrhea in pigs. Silver nanomaterials (Ag NMs) have attracted great interests in recent years due to their excellent anti-microorganism properties. Herein, four representative Ag NMs including spherical Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs, NM-300), two kinds of silver nanowires (XFJ011) and silver colloids (XFJ04) were selected to study their inhibitory effect on TGEV-induced host cell infection in vitro. Ag NPs were uniformly distributed, with particle sizes less than 20 nm by characterization of environmental scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. Two types of silver nanowires were 60 nm and 400 nm in diameter, respectively. The average diameter of the silver colloids was approximately 10 nm. TGEV infection induced the occurring of apoptosis in swine testicle (ST) cells, down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, up-regulated the expression of Bax, altered mitochondrial membrane potential, activated p38 MAPK signal pathway, and increased expression of p53 as evidenced by immunofluorescence assays, real-time PCR, flow cytometry and Western blot. Under non-toxic concentrations, Ag NPs and silver nanowires significantly diminished the infectivity of TGEV in ST cells. Moreover, further results showed that Ag NPs and silver nanowires decreased the number of apoptotic cells induced by TGEV through regulating p38/mitochondria-caspase-3 signaling pathway. Our data indicate that Ag NMs are effective in prevention of TGEV-mediated cell infection as a virucidal agent or as an inhibitor of viral entry and the present findings may provide new insights into antiviral therapy of coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Xiaonan; Wang, Peng; Bai, Ru; Cong, Yingying; Suo, Siqingaowa; Ren, Xiaofeng; Chen, Chunying","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c5969836b3f2880ca845e5cd4c4414a57db74c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112386.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961214000842; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524838/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961214000842","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","MAPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ag NPs","TGEV infection","silver colloids","representative Ag NMs","kinds of silver nanowires","types of silver nanowires","Silver nanomaterials","prevention of TGEV","infectivity of TGEV","spherical Ag nanoparticles","TGEV-induced host cell infection","ST cells","mediated cell infection","expression of Bax","expression of Bcl","transmission electron microscope","number of apoptotic cells","increased expression of p53","p38 MAPK signal pathway","regulating p38","Abstract Coronaviruses","average diameter","characterization of environmental scanning electron microscope","antiviral therapy of coronaviruses","mitochondrial membrane potential","flow cytometry","real-time PCR","present findings","immunofluorescence assays","new insights","XFJ011","recent years","virucidal agent","occurring of apoptosis","swine testicle","great interests","inhibitor of viral entry","Western blot","mitochondria-caspase","gastrointestinal tract of hosts","inhibitory effect","excellent anti-microorganism properties","non-toxic concentrations","severe diarrhea","significant coronavirus","family Coronaviridae","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","particle sizes","XFJ04","data","results","pigs"],"language":"en"},

Recent data are needed to determine the viral and atypical bacterial etiologies in children with defined clinical manifestations of ARIs. METHODS: During one year, we conducted a prospective study on ARIs in children between 2 to 59 months in the community hospital of Ampasimanjeva, located in the south-east of Madagascar. Respiratory samples were analyzed by multiplex real-time RT-PCR, including 18 viruses and 2 atypical bacteria. The various episodes of ARI were grouped into four clinical manifestations with well-documented diagnosis: \u201CCommunity Acquired Pneumonia\u201D(CAP, group I), \u201COther acute lower respiratory infections (Other ALRIs, group II)\u201D, \u201CUpper respiratory tract infections with cough (URTIs with cough, group III)\u201Dand \u201CUpper respiratory tract infections without cough (URTIs without cough, group IV)\u201D. RESULTS: 295 children were included in the study between February 2010 and February 2011. Viruses and/or atypical bacteria respiratory pathogens were detected in 74.6% of samples, the rate of co-infection was 27.3%. Human rhinovirus (HRV; 20.5%), metapneumovirus (HMPV A/B, 13.8%), coronaviruses (HCoV, 12.5%), parainfluenza virus (HPIV, 11.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV A/B, 11.8%) were the most detected. HRV was predominantly single detected (23.8%) in all the clinical groups while HMPV A/B (23.9%) was mainly related to CAP (group I), HPIV (17.3%) to the \u201COther ALRIs\u201D (group II), RSV A/B (19.5%) predominated in the group \u201CURTIs with cough\u201D (group III) and Adenovirus (HAdV, 17.8%) was mainly detected in the \u201Cwithout cough\u201D (group IV).

To date, no effective treatments exist and current prophylactic therapy access is limited and is only \u223C50% effective. To attenuate the risk of RSV infection, we hypothesized that bioengineering of either the virus particle or host cell via the covalent grafting of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) [mPEG] would prevent infection. To this end, the anti-viral effects of grafting concentration, linker chemistry and polymer length on RSV infection was assessed. For viral modification, short chain polymers (2kDa) were significantly more effective than long chain (20kDa) polymers. In contrast, modification of host cells with small polymers provided no (\u223C0%) protection while long chain polymers effectively prevented infection. For example, at 48hours post-infection at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 and grafting concentrations of 5, 7.5, and 15mm, 20kDa mPEG decreased infection by 45, 83, and 91%, respectively. Importantly, both viral and host cell PEGylation strategies were able to provide near complete protection against RSV infection of both non-polarized and polarized cells. In conclusion, mPEG-modification of either RSV or the host cell is a highly effective prophylactic strategy for preventing viral infection.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sutton, Troy C.; Scott, Mark D.","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbf5097a23e7986f3074116b903a6761e2a980b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112411.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20153523/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961210001274; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.095; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961210001274","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","risk of RSV infection","multiplicity of infection","hours post-infection","viral modification","modification of host cells","long chain polymers","mPEG-modification","kDa mPEG","short chain polymers","effective treatments","small polymers","effective prophylactic strategy","host cell PEGylation strategies","anti-viral effects of grafting concentration","grafting concentrations","polarized cells","covalent grafting of methoxypoly","virus particle","complete protection","current prophylactic therapy access","Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus","linker chemistry","polymer length","ethylene glycol","significant cause of morbidity","bioengineering","humans","end","example","contrast","date","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Recent reports suggest an association with use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for coronaviruses. Higher ACE2 concentrations might lead to increased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 in patients on RAAS inhibitors. METHODS We measured ACE2 concentrations in 1485 men and 537 women with heart failure (index cohort). Results were validated in 1123 men and 575 women (validation cohort). RESULTS The median age was 69 years for men and 75 years for women. The strongest predictor of elevated concentrations of ACE2 in both cohorts was male sex (estimate = 0.26, P \u003C 0.001; and 0.19, P \u003C 0.001, respectively). In the index cohort, use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was not an independent predictor of plasma ACE2. In the validation cohort, ACE inhibitor (estimate = -0.17, P = 0.002) and ARB use (estimate = -0.15, P = 0.03) were independent predictors of lower plasma ACE2, while use of an MRA (estimate = 0.11, P = 0.04) was an independent predictor of higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. CONCLUSION In two independent cohorts of patients with heart failure, plasma concentrations of ACE2 were higher in men than in women, but use of neither an ACE inhibitor nor an ARB was associated with higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. These data might explain the higher incidence and fatality rate of COVID-19 in men, but do not support previous reports suggesting that ACE inhibitors or ARBs increase the vulnerability for COVID-19 through increased plasma ACE2 concentrations.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sama, Iziah E; Ravera, Alice; Santema, Bernadet T; van Goor, Harry; Ter Maaten, Jozine M; Cleland, John G F; Rienstra, Michiel; Friedrich, Alex W; Samani, Nilesh J; Ng, Leong L; Dickstein, Kenneth; Lang, Chim C; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Anker, Stefan D; Ponikowski, Piotr; Metra, Marco; van Veldhuisen, Dirk J; Voors, Adriaan A","journal":"European heart journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388565/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAAS","ARB","MRA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasma concentrations of ACE2","Higher ACE2 concentrations","increased plasma ACE2 concentrations","independent predictor of higher plasma ACE2 concentrations","independent predictor of plasma ACE2","independent predictors of lower plasma ACE2","strongest predictor of elevated concentrations of ACE2","ACE inhibitors","estimate","women","ARB use","higher incidence","RAAS inhibitors","index cohort","validation cohort","use of renin","independent cohorts of patients","angiotensin receptor blockers","ARBs","heart failure","increased vulnerability","functional receptor","years","Results","angiotensin-aldosterone system","mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists","median age","previous reports","Recent reports","current pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV","fatality rate of COVID","wide age group","elderly individuals","association","MRAs","male sex","CONCLUSION","coronaviruses","data","cardiovascular disease","enzyme","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

In response, they release interferons (IFNs) and activate a ubiquitously expressed pseudokinase/endoribonuclease RNase L. RNase L executes regulated RNA decay and halts global translation. Here we developed a biosensor for 2\u2019,5\u2019-oligoadenylate (2-5A), the natural activator of RNase L. We found that 2-5A was acutely synthesized by cells in response to dsRNA sensing, which immediately triggered cellular RNA cleavage by RNase L and arrested host protein synthesis. However, translation-arrested cells still transcribed IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and secreted IFNs of types I and III (IFN-\u03B2 and IFN-\u03BB). Our data suggests that IFNs escape from the action of RNase L on translation. We propose that 2-5A/RNase L pathway serves to rapidly and accurately suppress basal protein synthesis, preserving privileged production of defense proteins of the innate immune system. RNase L is a mammalian enzyme that can stop global protein synthesis during interferon response. Cells must balance the need to make interferons (which are proteins) with the risk to lose cell-wide translation due to RNase L. This balance can most simply be achieved if RNase L was activated late in the interferon response. However, we show by engineering a biosensor for the RNase L pathway, that on the contrary, RNase L activation precedes interferon synthesis. Further, translation of interferons evades the action of RNase L. Our data suggest that RNase L facilitates a switch of protein synthesis from homeostasis to specific needs of innate immune signaling.","publish_time":"2018-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chitrakar, Alisha; Rath, Sneha; Donovan, Jesse; Demarest, Kaitlin; Li, Yize; Sridhar, Raghavendra Rao; Weiss, Susan R.; Kotenko, Sergei V.; Wingreen, Ned S.; Korennykh, Alexei","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ad7c66b41f026a0ace33f3f8013367166d903a0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b801b7f92cff2155d98f0e3404229c67b60e2f9f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/476341","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["action of RNase","endoribonuclease RNase","natural activator of RNase","interferon synthesis","translation of interferons","global protein synthesis","translation-arrested cells","global translation","interferon response","basal protein synthesis","switch of protein synthesis","arrested host protein synthesis","cell-wide translation","IFN-\u03B2","IFN-\u03BB","IFNs escape","data","pathway","biosensor","balance","regulated RNA decay","cellular RNA cleavage","double-stranded RNA","innate immune system","secreted IFNs of types","transcribed IFN-stimulated genes","specific needs of innate immune","dsRNA sensing","privileged production of defense proteins","ISGs","homeostasis","mammalian enzyme","risk","mammals","activation","pseudokinase","foreign material","oligoadenylate"],"language":"en"},

The S gene sequences of these viral strains were compared with those of recently published strains BCV-Mebus, BCV-Quebec, and BCV-F15.

There were 45 to 56 nt differences between the virulent and avirulent groups while there were 6 to 14 nt differences among four avirulent strains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the S proteins had typical properties of membrane glycoproteins.

Respiratory illnesses are the third leading cause of death amongst the noncommunicable diseases. The current COVID-19 pandemic, however, also highlights the impact of communicable respiratory syndromes. In the clinical routine, prolonged postanesthetic respiratory instability worsens the patient outcome. Even though early and continuous, long-term cardiorespiratory monitoring has been proposed or even proven to be beneficial in several situations, implementations thereof are sparse. We employed our recently presented, multimodal patch stethoscope to estimate Einthoven electrocardiogram (ECG) Lead I and II from a single 55 mm ECG lead. Using the stethoscope and ECG subsystems, the pre-ejection period (PEP) and left ventricular ejection time (LVET) were estimated. ECG-derived respiration techniques were used in conjunction with a novel, phonocardiogram-derived respiration approach to extract respiratory parameters. Medical-grade references were the SOMNOmedics SOMNO HD(TM) and Osypka ICON-Core(TM). In a study including 10 healthy subjects, we analyzed the performances in the supine, lateral, and prone position. Einthoven I and II estimations yielded correlations exceeding 0.97. LVET and PEP estimation errors were 10% and 21%, respectively. Respiratory rates were estimated with mean absolute errors below 1.2 bpm, and the respiratory signal yielded a correlation of 0.66. We conclude that the estimation of ECG, PEP, LVET, and respiratory parameters is feasible using a wearable, multimodal acquisition device and encourage further research in multimodal signal fusion for respiratory signal estimation.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klum, Michael; Urban, Mike; Tigges, Timo; Pielmus, Alexandru-Gabriel; Feldheiser, Aarne; Schmitt, Theresa; Orglmeister, Reinhold","journal":"Sensors (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba8a7815eb6ac4e669f420e53e267438f180b478.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7180963.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/s20072033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32260436/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Einthoven"],"organizations":["LVET","PEP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory parameters","respiratory signal estimation","Respiratory rates","Respiratory illnesses","estimation of ECG","ECG lead","LVET","ECG subsystems","prolonged postanesthetic respiratory instability","impact of communicable respiratory syndromes","PEP estimation errors","ECG-derived respiration techniques","multimodal signal fusion","multimodal patch stethoscope","TM","multimodal acquisition device","leading cause of death","main cause of death","phonocardiogram-derived respiration approach","Einthoven electrocardiogram","noncommunicable diseases","Cardiovascular diseases","pre-ejection period","ventricular ejection time","mean absolute errors","research","SOMNOmedics SOMNO HD","wearable","sleep disordered breathing","Osypka ICON-Core","conjunction","novel","clinical routine","bpm","patient outcome","Medical-grade references","performances","supine","long-term cardiorespiratory monitoring","aggravating factor","situations","implementations","healthy subjects","prone position","current COVID","pandemic","study","estimations","correlations"],"language":"en"},

Environmental tobacco/cigarette smoke (CS) disrupts circadian clock leading to enhanced inflammatory responses. Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) increases hospitalization rates and death in susceptible individuals, including patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). We hypothesized that molecular clock disruption is enhanced by IAV infection, altering cellular and lung function, leading to severity in airway disease phenotypes. C57BL/6J mice exposed to chronic CS, BMAL1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type littermates were infected with IAV. Following infection, we measured diurnal rhythms of clock gene expression in the lung, locomotor activity, pulmonary function, inflammatory, pro-fibrotic and emphysematous responses. Chronic CS exposure combined with IAV infection altered the timing of clock gene expression and reduced locomotor activity in parallel with increased lung inflammation, disrupted rhythms of pulmonary function, and emphysema. BMAL1 KO mice infected with IAV showed pronounced detriments in behavior and survival, and increased lung inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses. This suggests that remodeling of lung clock function following IAV infection alters clock-dependent gene expression and normal rhythms of lung function, enhanced emphysematous and injurious responses.

Conclusion: The S450-650-based ELISA can detect anti-S IgG Abs with high sensitivity and specificity.","publish_time":"2005-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Jincun; Wang, Wei; Wang, Guang-Fa; Li, Yonghua; Zhuang, Hui; Xu, Xiaoyuan; Ren, Furong; Zhao, Zhendong; Gao, Xiao-Ming","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef1852fa8f6d2f389be7f146b3374c2d33ea1b81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108335.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653204002665; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653204002665","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E.

The primary goal of this program was to ensure the safety of staff, patients, and the general public by training staff in the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) before, during, and after care of patients with EVD. METHODS: We delivered a 4-hour experiential training program to frontline health care professionals who would be expected to care for a patient with EVD. The program occurred in a simulation center with multiple flexible spaces and consisted of demonstration, multiple skills practice sessions, and a patient simulation case. We analyzed completed pre- and posttraining questionnaires. The questionnaire assessed their subjective level of confidence in three key areas: donning and doffing PPE, performing clinical skills while wearing PPE, and management of a contamination breach. RESULTS: This program was effectively deployed in the STRATUS Center for Medical Simulation over a 4-month period, with 220 health care professionals participating in the training and 195 participants completing the pre-/posttraining questionnaires. Our intervention significantly increased the confidence of participants on each primary objective (p = .001 for all three stations). DISCUSSION: This interprofessional simulation-based program has been shown to be a well-received method of training clinicians to manage patients collaboratively during an EVD outbreak. Our intent is that the skills taught in this training program would also be transferable to management of other infectious diseases in the clinical setting.","publish_time":"2016-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Keeffe, Dara Ann; Bradley, Dorothy; Evans, Linda; Bustamante, Nirma; Timmel, Matthew; Akkineni, Roopa; Mulloy, Deborah; Goralnick, Eric; Pozner, Charles","journal":"MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1aaa45043de59cda6c14acd355518c688f37b374.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6354722.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30800728/; https://doi.org/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10433","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVD","PPE","STRATUS Center for Medical Simulation"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["comprehensive training program","training staff","hour experiential training program","care of patients","interprofessional simulation-based program","simulation center","patient simulation case","frontline staff","frontline health care professionals","Medical Simulation","clinical skills","EVD outbreak","well-received method of training clinicians","doffing PPE","confidence of participants","management","safety of staff","posttraining questionnaires","multiple skills practice sessions","STRATUS Center","clinical setting","primary objective","primary goal","multiple flexible spaces","subjective level of confidence","demonstration","correct use of personal protective equipment","key areas","infectious diseases","need","month period","general public","Women\u0027s Hospital","Ebola viral disease","INTRODUCTION","Brigham","DISCUSSION","contamination breach","intervention","stations","intent","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to investigate whether environmental contamination may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: Air samples were collected by natural precipitation, and environmental surface samples were collected by conventional surface swabbing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Viral RNA was not detected in the 44 air samples. The positive rates in 200 environmental surface samples in medical areas (24.83%) was higher than that in living quarters (3.64%), with a significant difference (P\u003C0.05). The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and ICU, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between them (P=0.238). The top five sampling sites with a positive rate in medical areas were beepers (50.00%), water machine buttons (50.00%), elevator buttons (42.86%), computer mouses (40.00%), and telephones (40.00%). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the touchable surfaces in the designated hospital for COVID-19 were heavily contaminated, suggesting that the environment is a potential medium of disease transmission.

The potential of these vector vaccines lies in the hope that such a vaccine would be cheaper, safer and/or more effective than existing vaccines to some pathogens. Vaccinia virus as a vector has attracted most attention to date because: (a) several immunogenes can be inserted into its genome without destroying its infectivity; (b) the immunogens appear to be produced normally; (c) vaccinia virus has been used highly successfully to eradicate smallpox; and (d) it has a wide host-range and thus might find veterinary as well as human medical application. Experimental vaccines, successfully tested in animals, have been prepared using immunogenes from influenza virus, hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus. Apathogenic enteric bacteria have some potential as vectors, most probably against enteric pathogens, although the potential of viral vectors is likely to be realized first. Parasitic worms and protozoa devastate millions of people. When the immunogens of these organisms have been identified there will be added impetus to investigate the potential of vector vaccines against these pathogens.","publish_time":"1985-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cavanagh, David","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11516584223d91a62cfce33470f08bec17319bf2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0264410X85900118; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0264410X85900118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccinia virus","potential of vector vaccines","influenza virus","smallpox vaccine virus","hepatitis B virus","herpes simplex virus","immunogenes","existing vaccines","immunogens","production of experimental vaccines","enteric pathogens","potential of viral vectors","Apathogenic enteric bacteria","proteins","protozoa","code","protection","carrier","Parasitic worms","millions of people","recent development","wide host-range","human medical application","unrelated viruses","infectivity","animals","hope","genome","attention","date","impetus","organisms"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Six hundred and two children have been diagnosed with KD during the period January 1993 to May 2017 in the Allergy Immunology Unit, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh. Data were collected from inpatient records in Allergy Immunology Unit and follow\u2010up files in the Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic. RESULTS: Of 602 children, 11 (1.83%) had a predominant pulmonary presentation of KD. Mean age at diagnosis of KD was 2.5 years. Fever, cough and respiratory distress were the presenting complaints in all patients. First sign of KD was noted at a mean duration of 14.5 days from the onset of symptoms. Periungual desquamation was the most common clinical sign (72.7%). Persistent fever in spite of antimicrobials, thrombocytosis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C\u2010reactive protein levels pointed toward a diagnosis of KD in our patients. Parenchymal consolidation was evident on chest X\u2010ray in all patients, pleural effusion in six, empyema in three, and pneumothorax in two patients. Coronary artery abnormalities were evident in three patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given after a mean period of 22.4 days of onset of fever. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of KD is often delayed in children who have a predominantly pulmonary presentation. This can have adverse clinical consequences.","publish_time":"2017-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Surjit; Gupta, Aman; Jindal, Ankur Kumar; Gupta, Anju; Suri, Deepti; Rawat, Amit; Vaidya, Pankaj C.; Singh, Meenu","journal":"Pediatr Pulmonol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2641c873542ce7a1b220b4af567cb12a18e15901.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167766.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.23885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28950425/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD","Allergy Immunology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of KD","sign of KD","patients","predominant pulmonary presentation of KD","children","mean period","Pulmonary involvement","Allergy Immunology Unit","days of onset","mean duration","Mean age","initial presentation","Persistent fever","common clinical sign","onset of symptoms","predominant mucocutaneous manifestations","adverse clinical consequences","Advanced Pediatrics Centre","follow\u2010up files","elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate","Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education","thrombocytosis","chest X\u2010ray","reactive protein levels","inpatient records","multisystemic vasculitis","Research","respiratory distress","spite of antimicrobials","presenting complaints","pleural effusion","Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic","Parenchymal consolidation","cough","Coronary artery abnormalities","Periungual desquamation","Kawasaki disease","empyema","Chandigarh","OBJECTIVES","Intravenous immunoglobulin","Data","pneumothorax","years","CONCLUSIONS","experience","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Methods RT-PCR methods were used to detect HRVs in throat and nasal swabs collected from 6104 adult patients with ARTIs from December 2005 to April 2008 in Beijing, China. Results HRV strains were detected in 271 ARTIs cases, 65% of which tested positive for HRV-A, 25% for HRV-B, and 10% for HRV-C. Aside from fever, pharyngeal congestion and headache were the most common clinical symptoms observed in the HRVs infected patients. HRV-A infected patients had a higher percentage of upper respiratory symptoms than patients infected by the two other HRV species. Systemic symptoms such as chilliness and myalgia were more frequent in people infected by HRV-B. The three HRV species exhibited unique infection timing when analyzed monthly. Conclusion HRV-C can be detected in adult patients with acute upper respiratory tract infections, but is not the predominant species in this population.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiang, Zichun; Gonzalez, Richard; Wang, Zhong; Xiao, Yan; Chen, Lan; Li, Taisheng; Vernet, Guy; Paranhos-Baccal\u00E0, Gl\u00E1ucia; Jin, Qi; Wang, Jianwei","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84e11965df7e6020fba758e481792a4e7b237390.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112692.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445310001842; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2010.07.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445310001842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20638411/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["species of HRV","HRV species","HRV-B","HRVs infected patients","Results HRV strains","Conclusion HRV-C","adult patients","predominant species","acute respiratory tract infections","acute upper respiratory tract infections","higher percentage of upper respiratory symptoms","common clinical symptoms","Systemic symptoms","ARTIs cases","clinical presentations","Methods RT-PCR methods","headache","myalgia","roles of human rhinoviruses","Chinese adults","nasal swabs","association","chilliness","fever","unique infection timing","pharyngeal congestion","throat","people","Summary Objective","population","Beijing","China"],"language":"en"},

Although its definitive physiological function is unknown, it may have a pathological role as the source of ectopic beats initiating atrial fibrillation. How the pulmonary myocardium gains pacemaker function is not clearly defined, although recent evidence indicates that changed transcriptional gene expression networks are at fault. The gene expression profile of this distinct cell type in situ was examined to investigate underlying molecular events that might contribute to atrial fibrillation. Via systems genetics, a whole-lung transcriptome data set from the BXD recombinant inbred mouse resource was analyzed, uncovering a pulmonary cardiomyocyte gene network of 24 transcripts, coordinately regulated by chromosome 1 and 2 loci. Promoter enrichment analysis and interrogation of publicly available ChIP-seq data suggested that transcription of this gene network may be regulated by the concerted activity of NKX2-5, serum response factor, myocyte enhancer factor 2, and also, at a post-transcriptional level, by RNA binding protein motif 20. Gene ontology terms indicate that this gene network overlaps with molecular markers of the stressed heart. Therefore, we propose that perturbed regulation of this gene network might lead to altered calcium handling, myocyte growth, and contractile force contributing to the aberrant electrophysiological properties observed in atrial fibrillation. We reveal novel molecular interactions and pathways representing possible therapeutic targets for atrial fibrillation. In addition, we highlight the utility of recombinant inbred mouse resources in detecting and characterizing gene expression networks of relatively small populations of cells that have a pathological significance.","publish_time":"2017-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boutilier, Jordan K.; Taylor, Rhonda L.; Mann, Tracy; McNamara, Elyshia; Hoffman, Gary J.; Kenny, Jacob; Dilley, Rodney J.; Henry, Peter; Morahan, Grant; Laing, Nigel G.; Nowak, Kristen J.","journal":"G3 (Bethesda)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97f0de00cdfd52961c9a8611c306de5778556eb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5592927.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.117.044651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28720711/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BXD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene network overlaps","pulmonary cardiomyocyte gene network","gene expression profile","atrial fibrillation","transcriptional gene expression networks","characterizing gene expression networks","Gene ontology terms","molecular markers","pulmonary myocardium gains pacemaker function","myocyte enhancer factor","novel molecular interactions","underlying molecular events","BXD recombinant inbred mouse resource","utility of recombinant inbred mouse resources","myocyte growth","pathological role","pathological significance","serum response factor","post-transcriptional level","definitive physiological function","lung transcriptome data set","available ChIP-seq data","pathways","possible therapeutic targets","interrogation","contractile force","altered calcium handling","distinct cell type","aberrant electrophysiological properties","source of ectopic beats","small populations of cells","muscular coat","RNA binding protein motif","situ","transcripts","Promoter enrichment analysis","fault","concerted activity of NKX2","stressed heart","caval veins","recent evidence","perturbed regulation","systems genetics","chromosome","loci","addition"],"language":"en"},

Implementing the gMMPI, this paper reviews the inequality of the coastal and non-coastal provinces, as well as the latent impact of scale efficiency change (SEC) for China. Using provincial data for the years 1996\u20132004, the empirical results are as follows. On average, China demonstrates an annual 3.191% productivity change, which is lower than 4.729% for the conventional MPI and accounts for about 26.508% of output growth over the period 1996\u20132004. Most of this change is propelled by technical progress, while a fraction is driven by the adjustment in production scale, and the efficiency change has an adverse effect. Furthermore, regional inequality is also found in this empirical work, and the productivity change of the coastal region is actually stronger than that of the non-coastal region. This paper also casts some focus on the China Western Development policy. Indeed, we do not find any outstanding achievement from the policy in the sample period, except that the west region sustained its rate of productivity change after 2000. Moreover, the SEC is found to be trivial in the advanced coastal region, but plays an important role in the relatively laggard non-coastal region. The implication of the positive SEC in the non-coastal region means that China\u0027s Western Development policy will improve the scale efficiency and the TFP growth of the west region.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ku-Hsieh; Huang, Yi-Ju; Yang, Chih-Hai","journal":"China Economic Review","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82376f249b7b19a8cf8b068e86e94bce5e879993.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043951X09000467; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X09000467","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEC","MPI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["west region","rate of productivity change","laggard non-coastal region","advanced coastal region","paper","latent impact of scale efficiency change","dynamics of China\u0027s productivity","China Western Development policy","non-coastal provinces","China\u0027s Western Development policy","production scale","gMMPI","positive SEC","sample period","generalized metafrontier Malmquist productivity index","TFP growth","output growth","empirical work","regional inequality","empirical results","developed methodology","important role","focus","accounts","fraction","years","adjustment","technical progress","adverse effect","conventional MPI","outstanding achievement","provincial data","implication","average"],"language":"en"},

Since there exists no comprehensive global surveillance system to monitor zoonotic disease emergence, the intervention measures discussed herein may prove effective temporary alternatives.","publish_time":"2010-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pike, Brian L.; Saylors, Karen E.; Fair, Joseph N.; LeBreton, Matthew; Tamoufe, Ubald; Djoko, Cyrille F.; Rimoin, Anne W.; Wolfe, Nathan D.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c329031c69d02e51abac14f127253ba0c5efbf0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2874076.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1086/652860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20450416/; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/50/12/1636/865448/50-12-1636.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease emergence process","animals","humans","zoonotic disease emergence","emerging diseases stem","global spread of emerging infectious diseases","communication strategies","paramount importance","overview of factors","human-animal interface","future prevention strategies","comprehensive global surveillance system","public health education","social mobilization","behavioral change","transmission of pathogenic agents","intervention measures","suggestions","origin","effective temporary alternatives","review"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Patients with septic myocardial injury were recruited, and were randomly divided into two groups: treatment group and control group. All patients in two groups received conventional cluster treatment, the patients in treatment group additional received Xuebijing injection dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride injection, and the patients in control group received the same amount of 0.9% sodium chloride injection. At the beginning of treatment and 3, 7 and 10-day after treatment, laboratory indicators of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were respectively tested in venous blood. The patient\u0027s length of stay in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the mortality in 28 days were recorded. RESULTS At 3, 7 and 10-day after treatment, the improvements of cTnI, NT-proBNP and PCT in treatment group were better than those in control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P \u003C 0.05). The mortality of treatment group in 28 days was not significantly different from that of control group (P \u003E 0.05).

The universal primers and specific TaqMan probes for each of the three genotypes, genotypes 1, 2, and 3, were designed within the 3\u2032-UTR of the CSFV. Non-CSFV swine virus and clinical samples from specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were both demonstrated to be CSFV-negative by RT-MRT-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was determined to be 1 viral copy/\u03BCl for each genotype of standard plasmid. For the analytical sensitivity experiment, 100 samples of 14 CSFV genotype 1 strains and 86 samples from CSFV outbreak farms were all detected as CSFV-positive by RT-MRT-PCR, and the genotype results were consistent with the results of sequencing from a previous study. The intra-assay and inter-assay variations of RT-MRT-PCR were below 3% in all experiments. The sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was the same as the reverse transcription nested PCR (RT-nPCR) and higher than reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and viral isolation from clinical samples. This assay was used further to evaluate the duration of viremia of wild-type CSFV in vaccinated exposed pigs. The results indicated that pigs vaccinated with the E2 subunit vaccine had longer viremia than pigs given the C-strain vaccine, which is compatible with the findings of previous studies. Thus, the new RT-MRT-PCR is a rapid, reproducible, sensitive, and specific genotyping tool for CSFV detection.","publish_time":"2009-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Yu-Liang; Pang, Victor Fei; Pan, Chu-Hsiang; Chen, Tsu-Han; Jong, Ming-Hwa; Huang, Tien-Shine; Jeng, Chian-Ren","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2beebd9c0a9e70f69f4f918308e171dda754de86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112934.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409002110; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409002110; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.04.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19414034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MRT-PCR","real-time PCR","CSFV genotype","reverse transcription PCR","new RT-MRT","CSFV detection","RT-nPCR","CSFV-negative","CSFV-positive","reverse transcription nested PCR","diagnostic sensitivity of RT","wild-type CSFV","CSFV outbreak farms","Non-CSFV swine virus","inter-assay variations of RT","clinical samples","genotype results","vaccinated exposed pigs","specific genotyping tool","rapid detection","results of sequencing","intra-assay","genotypes","specific pathogen-free","specific TaqMan probes","genotype of standard plasmid","analytical sensitivity experiment","classical swine fever virus","viral isolation","duration of viremia","viral copy","previous study","E2 subunit vaccine","C-strain vaccine","findings of previous studies","strains","\u03BCl","universal primers","SPF","UTR","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Multiplex PCR was performed using the Allplex\u2122 respiratory and gastrointestinal panel assay kits to detect 46 microorganisms. RT-PCR was performed for klassevirus, Aichivirus, and human parechovirus (HPeV) detection. In total, 71 air samples were collected during the Asian (8 samples) and non-Asian (63 samples) dust events. During an Asian dust event, only one human rhinovirus (HRV)-positive air sample was collected on April 23. During the non-Asian dust period, HRV, HPeV, norovirus (NoV), enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and Blastocystis hominis were detected in four, two, one, one, one, and one air samples, respectively.

One recent review reported that in a small number of cases, two PCR swabs of the placenta were sent in additional to neonatal and cord blood testing, and both placental PCR swabs were negative.1 Other studies have demonstrated the finding of SARS-CoV2 IgM in neonates born to mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy,2,3 findings that may indicate vertical transmission of the virus in utero. We report our experience with placental/membrane SARS-CoV2 RNA PCR swab results after delivery to a series of symptomatic mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. Methods IRB approval was obtained. All pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who gave birth between March 1, 2020 and April 20, 2020 at NYU Langone Health were identified by a search of the electronic medical record. Charts were reviewed for documentation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR testing sent from either the placenta or membranes within 30 minutes following delivery. PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 was performed using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche) or the Cepheid Xpert Xpress assay. Placental swabs were obtained from the amniotic surface after clearing the surface of maternal blood (placental PCR). Membrane swabs were obtained from between the amnion and chorion after manual separation of the membranes (membrane PCR). Maternal COVID-19 illness was categorized as mild, severe, or critical.4 The time interval from maternal diagnosis of COVID-19 to delivery was calculated in days. Infants were tested with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR between days of life 1 and 5 while hospitalized. Hospitalized infants were also assessed for clinical signs and symptoms, including fever, cough, and nasal congestion. Results Of 32 COVID-19 positive pregnant patients who gave birth in this timeframe, placental or membrane swabs were sent from 11 patients (Table). Three of 11 swabs were positive. None of the infants tested positive for SARS-CoV2 on days of life 1 through 5, and none demonstrated symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Discussion Of 11 placental or membrane swabs sent following delivery, 3 swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, all in women with moderate to severe COVID-19 illness at time of delivery. This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in placental or membrane samples. While there were no clinical signs of vertical transmission, our findings raise the possibility of intrapartum viral exposure. Given the mixing of maternal and fetal fluid and tissue at time of delivery, the origin of the detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in our series is unclear. It may represent contamination from maternal blood, amniotic fluid, or COVID-19 infection of the membranes and amniotic sac. For those infants who were delivered vaginally, contamination with vaginal secretions is also a possible source, although prior studies on vaginal secretions have failed to demonstrate the presence of COVID-19.5,6 Although all of our neonates tested negative in the first 5 days of life, many were born via cesarean deliveries with decreased length of exposure to these tissues, which may be associated with a decreased likelihood of vertical transmission. Additionally, nasopharyngeal testing immediately after delivery may not be the ideal approach to evaluate vertical transmission if exposure occurs at the time of delivery, as the virus may require a longer incubation period before these swabs convert to positive. In summary, the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR in placenta/membranes at the time of delivery suggests the need for further research into the possibility of vertical transmission.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Penfield, Christina A.; Brubaker, Sara G.; Limaye, Meghana A.; Lighter, Jennifer; Ratner, Adam J.; Thomas, Kristen M.; Meyer, Jessica; Roman, Ashley S.","journal":"Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d68cfcdd316abf78f13ff135587d15fcbd476f0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589933320300768; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391518/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589933320300768?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IRB","NYU Langone Health","Cepheid Xpert Xpress"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["placental PCR swabs","Placental swabs","Membrane swabs","Maternal COVID","membrane PCR","time of delivery","presence of SARS","presence of COVID","detected SARS-CoV","cobas SARS-CoV","severe COVID","symptoms of COVID","finding of SARS","documentation of SARS","confirmed COVID","following delivery","nasopharyngeal swabs","maternal diagnosis of COVID","membrane SARS-CoV2 RNA PCR swab results","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","RNA RT-PCR testing","membranes","possibility of vertical transmission","positive pregnant patients","clinical signs of vertical transmission","membrane samples","days of life","presence of viral RNA","surface of maternal blood","decreased likelihood of vertical transmission","time interval","mixing of maternal","infection","nasopharyngeal testing","Hospitalized infants","cord blood testing","amniotic fluid","amniotic surface","pregnant women","CoV2 IgM","findings","decreased length of exposure","possibility of intrapartum viral exposure","illness","vaginal secretions","amniotic sac","contamination","neonates","birth","pregnancy","series of symptomatic mothers","fetal fluid","prior studies","antepartum period","associated disease","longer incubation period","Cepheid Xpert Xpress assay","fever","possible source","manual separation","Roche","research","timeframe","origin","small number of cases","cesarean deliveries","ideal approach","cough","fetus","chorion","amnion","emergence","process of labor","need","electronic medical record","reports","nasal congestion","tissues","summary","utero","minutes","NYU Langone Health","Discussion","experience","recent review","Methods IRB approval","Charts","concerns","study","Introduction","Table"],"language":"en"},

Passive transfer of A33-directed monoclonal antibodies or vaccination with an A33 subunit vaccine confers protection against lethal poxvirus challenge in animal models. Homologs of A33 are highly conserved among members of the Orthopoxvirus genus and are potential candidates for inclusion in vaccines or assays targeting extracellular enveloped virus activity. One monoclonal antibody directed against VACV A33, MAb-1G10, has been shown to target a conformation-dependent epitope. Interestingly, while it recognizes VACV A33 as well as the corresponding variola homolog, it does not bind to the monkeypox homolog. In this study, we utilized a random phage display library to investigate the epitope recognized by MAb-1G10 that is critical for facilitating cell-to-cell spread of the vaccinia virus. RESULTS: By screening with linear or conformational random phage libraries, we found that phages binding to MAb-1G10 display the consensus motif CEPLC, with a disulfide bond formed between two cysteine residues required for MAb-1G10 binding. Although the phage motif contained no linear sequences homologous to VACV A33, structure modeling and analysis suggested that residue D115 is important to form the minimal epitope core. A panel of point mutants expressing the ectodomain of A33 protein was generated and analyzed by either binding assays such as ELISA and immunoprecipitation or a functional assessment by blocking MAb-1G10 mediated comet inhibition in cell culture. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm L118 as a component of the MAb-1G10 binding epitope, and further identify D115 as an essential residue. By defining the minimum conformational structure, as well as the conformational arrangement of a short peptide sequence recognized by MAb-1G10, these results introduce the possibility of designing small molecule mimetics that may interfere with the function of A33 in vivo. This information will also be useful for designing improved assays to evaluate the potency of monoclonal and polyclonal products that target A33 or A33-modulated EV dissemination.","publish_time":"2012-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Yong; Wang, Yonggang; Struble, Evi B; Zhang, Pei; Chowdhury, Soma; Reed, Jennifer L; Kennedy, Michael; Scott, Dorothy E; Fisher, Robert W","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3495767.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23006741/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-217","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VACV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VACV A33","function of A33","Homologs of A33","MAb-1G10 binding epitope","ectodomain of A33 protein","A33 subunit vaccine","Passive transfer of A33","A33-modulated EV dissemination","binding assays","MAb-1G10 mediated comet inhibition","RESULTS","phage motif","conformational random phage libraries","extracellular enveloped form of vaccinia virus","extracellular enveloped virus activity","monoclonal antibodies","potency of monoclonal","monoclonal antibody","improved assays","conformational arrangement","residue D115","minimum conformational structure","random phage display library","cell culture","minimal epitope core","conformation-dependent epitope","structure modeling","essential residue","monkeypox homolog","linear sequences homologous","integral membrane protein","consensus motif CEPLC","corresponding variola homolog","lethal poxvirus challenge","protection","vaccines","analysis","inclusion","vaccination","Orthopoxvirus genus","potential candidates","disulfide bond","short peptide sequence","functional assessment","cysteine residues","ELISA","immunoprecipitation","type","possibility","screening","polyclonal products","component","animal models","panel of point mutants","members","L118","phages","small molecule mimetics","CONCLUSIONS","study","BACKGROUND","information"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this paper was to provide a useful updated review of the role of the main available immunostimulants, giving particular focus on Pidotimod use and its potentials utility in respiratory diseases. Pidotimod showed its usefulness in reducing need for antibiotics in airway infections, increasing the level of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) and T-lymphocyte subsets (CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B) endowed with immunomodulatory activity that affect both innate and adaptive immune responses. Higher expression of TLR2 and of HLA-DR molecules, induction of dendritic cell maturation and release of pro-inflammatory molecules, stimulation of T lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation toward a Th1 phenotype, as well as an increase of the phagocytosis have been demonstrated to be associated with Pidotimod in in vitro studies.

Surveys of antibody levels in bulk tank milk have shown very high nationwide prevalences of both BCV and BRSV, with large variations between regions. In the Swedish beef cattle population however, no investigations have yet been performed regarding the prevalence and geographical distribution of BCV and BRSV. A cross-sectional serological survey for BCV and BRSV was carried out in Swedish beef cattle to explore any geographical patterns of these infections. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 2,763 animals located in 2,137 herds and analyzed for presence of antibodies to BCV and BRSV. Moran\u0027s I was calculated to assess spatial autocorrelation, and identification of geographical cluster was performed using spatial scan statistics. RESULTS: Animals detected positive to BCV or BRSV were predominately located in the central-western and some southern parts of Sweden. Moran\u0027s I indicated global spatial autocorrelation. BCV and BRSV appeared to be spatially related: two areas in southern Sweden (Skaraborg and Sk\u00E5ne) had a significantly higher prevalence of BCV (72.5 and 65.5% respectively); almost the same two areas were identified as being high-prevalence clusters for BRSV (69.2 and 66.8% respectively). An area in south-east Sweden (Kronoberg-Blekinge) had lower prevalences for both infections than expected (23.8 and 20.7% for BCV and BRSV respectively). Another area in middle-west Sweden (V\u00E4rmland-Dalarna) had also a lower prevalence for BRSV (7.9%). Areas with beef herd density \u003E 10 per 100 km(2 )were found to be at significantly higher risk of being part of high-prevalence clusters. CONCLUSION: These results form a basis for further investigations of between-herds dynamics and risk factors for these infections in order to design effective control strategies.","publish_time":"2010-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beaudeau, Francois; Bj\u00F6rkman, Camilla; Alenius, Stefan; Fr\u00F6ssling, Jenny","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31f9d7bce1db40d866a3e93b06ff9515c34fc3b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2898781.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-52-33; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20492637/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moran"],"organizations":["BCV","BRSV"],"locations":["Sweden","southern Sweden"],"keyphrases":["BRSV","higher prevalence of BCV","geographical distribution of BCV","infections","high-prevalence clusters","southern Sweden","areas","Swedish beef cattle population","south-east Sweden","southern parts of Sweden","Swedish dairy cattle population","high nationwide prevalences","geographical patterns","middle-west Sweden","lower prevalences","global spatial autocorrelation","investigations","animals","RESULTS","higher risk","Moran\u0027s","identification of geographical cluster","spatial scan statistics","beef herd density","bovine coronavirus","herds dynamics","risk factors","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","bulk tank milk","order","Kronoberg-Blekinge","Sk\u00E5ne","Surveys of antibody levels","V\u00E4rmland-Dalarna","central-western","Skaraborg","large variations","cross-sectional serological survey","presence of antibodies","effective control strategies","Blood samples","basis","regions","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

FECV is associated with asymptomatic persistent enteric infections, while FIPV causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a usually fatal systemic disease in domestic cats and some wild Felidae. FIPV arises from FECV by mutation. FCoV also occur in two serotypes, I and II, of which the serotype I viruses are by far the most prevalent in the field. Yet, most of our knowledge about FCoV infections relates to serotype II viruses, particularly about the FIPV, mainly because type I viruses grow poorly in cell culture. Hence, the aim of the present work was the detailed study of the epidemiologically most relevant viruses, the avirulent serotype I viruses. Kittens were inoculated oronasally with different doses of two independent FECV field strains, UCD and RM. Persistent infection could be reproducibly established. The patterns of clinical symptoms, faecal virus shedding and seroconversion were monitored for up to 10 weeks revealing subtle but reproducible differences between the two viruses. Faecal virus, i.e. genomic RNA, was detected during persistent FECV infection only in the large intestine, downstream of the appendix, and could occasionally be observed also in the blood.

To prevent and mitigate these disasters it is critical to rapidly and accurately identify the characteristics of the contaminant sources. Although remarkable achievements have been made in identifying a single indoor contaminant source in recent years, the issues related to multiple contaminant sources are still challenging. This study presents a method for identifying the exact locations, emission rates, and release time of multiple indoor contaminant sources simultaneously released at constant rates, by considering sensor thresholds and measurement errors. The method uses a two-stage procedure for rapid source identification. Before the release of contaminants, only a limited number of time-consuming computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations need to be conducted. After the release of contaminants, the method can be executed in real-time. Through case studies in a three-dimensional office the method was numerically demonstrated and validated, and the results show that the method is effective and feasible. The effects of sensor threshold, measurement error and total sampling time on the source identification performance were analysed, and the limitations and applicability of the method were also discussed.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Hao; Li, Xianting; Chen, Zhilong; Wang, Mingyang","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ffe2548d4867c792ea343f9f2536bdea1f29d57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126656.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132314001929; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.06.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132314001929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288028/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["method","release of contaminants","release time of multiple indoor contaminant sources","multiple contaminant sources","single indoor contaminant source","indoor environment","source identification performance","rapid source identification","sudden release of airborne hazardous contaminants","constant rates","emission rates","sensor thresholds","measurement errors","severe disasters","total sampling time","effects of sensor threshold","limited number of time-consuming computational fluid dynamics","recent years","issues","CFD","stage procedure","exact locations","simulations","three-dimensional office","case studies","spread of toxic gases","limitations","explosion","results","applicability","characteristics","remarkable achievements","study"],"language":"en"},

In total, 2895 outbreaks of the disease have been reported by the veterinary authorities of Greece; sheep, goats and cattle were affected with officially reported morbidity rates of 11.0%, 2.0% and 3.5%, respectively. No vaccinations were allowed and conservative measures were implemented to attempt to limit the disease, which at the end had expanded throughout the country. In field investigations, a significantly higher bluetongue morbidity rate (27.5%) in sheep has been reported. During that work, clinical anaemia was encountered, which was characterised as macrocytic, hypochromic, regenerative and non-haemolytic. Other investigations, which are reviewed in this paper, have described an outbreak of Citrobacter freundii-associated enteritis in newborn kids, offspring of goats subclinically infected with Bluetongue virus, increased rate of early embryonic deaths, reduced conception rates, increased incidence risk of mastitis and reduced milk yield in herds of subclinically-infected cattle and detection of the virus from hunter-harvested tissue samples of roe-deer. In 2015, vaccines against the disease have been licenced; vaccinations started in May 2015. Then, in 2015, only one outbreak of the disease was confirmed, which could have been the result of a combination of reasons acting concurrently to prevent further cases.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vasileiou, N.G.C.; Fthenakis, G.

The aim of this study was to determine the viral etiology of respiratory infections in hospitalized children, to understand the viral seasonality in a major Lebanese hospital, and to correlate disease severity and the presence of virus. Over a 1\u2010year period, nasal and throat swabs were collected from 236 pediatric patients, aged 16\u2010year old or less and hospitalized for acute respiratory illness. Samples collected were tested for the presence of 17 respiratory viruses using multiplex real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. Pathogens were identified in 165 children (70%) and were frequently observed during fall and winter seasons. Co\u2010infection was found in 37% of positive samples. The most frequently detected pathogens were human Rhinovirus (hRV, 23%), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV, 19%), human Bocavirus (hBov, 15%), human Metapneumovirus (hMPV, 10%), and human Adenovirus (hAdV, 10%). A total of 48% of children were diagnosed with bronchiolitis and 25% with pneumonia. While bronchiolitis was often caused by RSV single virus infection and hAdV/hBoV coinfection, pneumonia was significantly associated with hBoV and HP1V1 infections. No significant correlation was observed between a single viral etiology infection and a specific clinical symptom. This study provides relevant facts on the circulatory pattern of respiratory viruses in Lebanon and the importance of using PCR as a useful tool for virus detection. Early diagnosis at the initial time of hospitalization may reduce the spread of the viruses in pediatric units. J. Med.

The most promising technologies cannot fully realize their potential if the relevant policy, legal, and regulatory issues are not adequately addressed.","publish_time":"2016-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Capps, Benjamin","journal":"International Encyclopedia of Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1ad095a026e0244c868b21e62a5fd42daf88727.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171904.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128036785003003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128036785003003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Genome-Wide Association Studies","Public Health Genomics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health systems","health delivery","clinical significance of public health genomics","Genome-Wide Association Studies","variants","Genome Sequencing approaches","population-wide variation","haplotype variation","relevant policy","life science system studies","branch of genetics","development of technologies","promising technologies","evidence-based policy","low error rates","molecular structure","impact","better analytical methods","environment complexity","phenotypes","potential","long-term stability of data storage","diagnosis","prognosis","markers","regulatory issues","prevention","Genomic medicine","resources","targets","treatment"],"language":"en"},

This virus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV was linked to a zoonotic origin from rhinolophid bats in 2005. Since then, numerous studies have described novel bat CoVs, including close relatives of the newly emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. In this paper we discuss CoV genomic properties and compare different taxonomic approaches in light of the technical difficulties of obtaining full genomic sequences directly from bat specimens. We first present an overview of the available studies on bat CoVs, with details on their chiropteran hosts, then comparatively analyze the increase in bat CoV studies and novel genomic sequences obtained since the SARS pandemic. We then conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus, to show that bats harbour more CoV diversity than other mammalian hosts and are widely represented in most, but not all parts of the tree of mammalian CoVs. We next discuss preliminary evidence for phylogenetic co-segregation of CoVs and bat hosts encompassing the Betacoronavirus clades b and d, with an emphasis on the sampling bias that exists among bat species and other mammals, then present examples of CoVs infecting different hosts on the one hand and viruses apparently confined to host genera on the other. We also demonstrate a geographic bias within available studies on bat CoVs, and identify a critical lack of information from biodiversity hotspots in Africa, Asia and Latin America. We then present evidence for a zoonotic origin of four of the six known human CoVs (HCoV), three of which likely involved bats, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E; compare the available data on CoV pathogenesis in bats to that in other mammalian hosts; and discuss hypotheses on the putative insect origins of CoV ancestors. Finally, we suggest caution with conclusions on the zoonotic potential of bat viruses, based only on genomic sequence data, and emphasize the need to preserve these ecologically highly relevant animals.

However, the role of the respiratory tract microbiome in the development of acute wheeze is unclear. To investigate whether severe wheezing episodes in children are associated with bacterial dysbiosis in the respiratory tract, oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 109 children with acute wheezing attending the only tertiary paediatric hospital in Perth, Australia. The bacterial community from these samples was explored using next generation sequencing and compared to samples from 75 non-wheezing controls. No significant difference in bacterial diversity was observed between samples from those with wheeze and healthy controls. Within the wheezing group, attendance at kindergarten or preschool was however, associated with increased bacterial diversity. Rhinovirus (RV) infection did not have a significant effect on bacterial community composition. A significant difference in bacterial richness was observed between children with RV-A and RV-C infection, however this is likely due to the differences in age group between the patient cohorts. The bacterial community within the oropharynx was found to be diverse and heterogeneous. Age and attendance at day care or kindergarten were important factors in driving bacterial diversity. However, wheeze and viral infection were not found to significantly relate to the bacterial community. Bacterial airway microbiome is highly variable in early life and its role in wheeze remains less clear than viral influences.","publish_time":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cuthbertson, Leah; Oo, Stephen W.

Outbreaks of EV-A71 and EV-D68 have been recently reported worldwide, sometimes related to severe clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe EV genetic diversity and the clinical outcomes from paediatric patients attended at a tertiary university hospital in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) from 2014 to 2017. STUDY DESIGN: Specimens were collected from paediatric (\u003C17 years old) cases with suspicion of respiratory tract infection or EV infection. EV laboratory-confirmation was performed by specific real-time multiplex RT-PCR assay. Partial viral VP1 protein was sequenced for genetic characterisation by phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: A total of 376 (7%) from 5703 cases were EV laboratory-confirmed. Phylogenetic analyses of VP1 (210; 81%) sequences distinguished up to 27 different EV types distributed within EV-A (82; 40%), EV-B (90; 42%), EV-C (5; 2%), and EV-D (33; 15%), in addition to 50 (19%) rhinoviruses. The most predominant were EV-A71 (37; 45%) and EV-D68 (32; 99%). EV-A71 was highly related to neurological complications (25/39, 63%), of which 20/39 were rhombencephalitis, and most EV-D68 (28/32, 88%) were associated with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), and exceptionally one (3%) with acute flaccid paralysis. CONCLUSIONS: EV-A71 and EV-D68 were the most detected EV in respiratory specimens. EV-A71 was highly related to neurological disease and EV-D68 was often associated with LRTI. However, both potential relatedness to neurological diseases makes the monitoring of EV circulation obligatory.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andr\u00E9s, Cristina; Vila, Jorgina; Gimferrer, Laura; Pi\u00F1ana, Maria; Esperalba, Juliana; Codina, Maria Gema; Barn\u00E9s, Meritxell; Mart\u00EDn, Maria Carmen; Fuentes, Francisco; Rubio, Susana; Alcubilla, Pilar; Rodrigo, Carlos; Pumarola, Tom\u00E0s; Ant\u00F3n, Andr\u00E9s","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/915e3056104a5b9483451f8500bf9793966228cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172671.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218302816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530096/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218302816; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.11.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI"],"locations":["Barcelona","Spain"],"keyphrases":["EV-A71","EV-D68","EV infection","detected EV","Outbreaks of EV","EV-B","EV-C","EV genetic diversity","EV laboratory-confirmation","different EV types","monitoring of EV circulation obligatory","respiratory specimens","neurological complications","lower respiratory tract infections","suspicion of respiratory tract infection","symptomatic infections","neurological diseases","cases","severe clinical outcomes","Phylogenetic analyses of VP1","severe complications","LRTI","paediatric patients","genetic characterisation","Partial viral VP1 protein","tertiary university hospital","specific real-time multiplex RT-PCR assay","Barcelona","Catalonia","years old","potential relatedness","Spain","OBJECTIVE","BACKGROUND","Enterovirus","CONCLUSIONS","STUDY DESIGN","acute flaccid paralysis","sequences","rhombencephalitis","RESULTS","total","addition","rhinoviruses"],"language":"en"},

The vaccines have become a big challenge in the last decades, where the attention has been focused on scientific challenges such as new vaccine development and adjuvants or delivery systems. The classical vaccines were developed from live-attenuated or killed organisms, such as influenza, smallpox, and BCG, as well as subunits such as Hepatitis B. The attenuated vaccines carry the risk of regaining their pathogenicity under immunosuppression conditions. The development of subunit vaccines without risk are considered as an essential need in combination with adequate delivery systems to obtain desired cell and humoral immune responses against infectious diseases. In the last decades, the use of nanoparticles as a delivery system in vaccines has received special attention to improve vaccine efficacy. These nanoparticles could be composed of lipids, metal and nonmetal inorganics, several polymers, and virus-like particles, which have been tested in research; some of them have already been approved for human and animal use. The characteristics of the nanoparticles have allowed targeting desired antigen-presenting cells to improve immunization strategies to induce protection. The main characteristics of the nanoparticles are to protect the antigens from early proteolytic degradation, control antigen release, and help antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells, and they should be safe for human and veterinary use. In addition, the nanoparticles could be modified in their physicochemical properties to target specific cells and improve vaccine efficacy. This chapter focuses on the nanoparticle-based vaccine formulations and the approaches used to realize efficient delivery of vaccines in order to induce host protective immunity against infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diaz-Ar\u00E9valo, Diana; Zeng, Mingtao","journal":"Nanopharmaceuticals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9ec2aeafe955826d48c46a28523e4f9ebf89fc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153331.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128177785000075; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128177785000075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hepatitis B.

Currently, there is little data available on the effects of disinfection and decontamination on positive pressure respiratory protective hoods (PPRPH). In this study, we evaluated the effect of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) on the disinfection of PPRPH to determine applicability of this method for disinfection of protective equipment, especially protective equipment with an electric supply system. A hydrogen peroxide-based fumigation sterilization cabinet was developed particularly for disinfection of protective equipment, and the disinfection experiments were conducted using four PPRPHs hung in the fumigation chamber. The pathogenic microorganism Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953 was used as a biological indicator in this study and the relationship between air flow (the amount of VHP) and disinfection was investigated. Both function and the material physical properties of the PPRPH were assessed following the disinfection procedure. No surviving Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953, both inside and outside of these disinfected PPRPHs, could be observed after a 60 min treatment with an air flow of 10.5\u201312.3 m3/h. Both function and material physical properties of these PPRPHs met the working requirements after disinfection. This study indicates that air flow in the fumigation chamber directly influences the concentration of VHP. The protective equipment fumigation sterilization cabinet developed in this paper achieves the complete sterilization of the PPRPHs when the air flow is at 10.5\u201312.3 m3/h, and provides a potential solution for the disinfection of various kind of protective equipment.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hao, Limei; Wu, Jinhui; Zhang, Enlei; Yi, Ying; Zhang, Zongxing; Zhang, Jinming; Qi, Jiancheng","journal":"Biosafety and Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d27c86dc7e45b874a7f1b7be9061f9d07c97723.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590053619300060; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053619300060","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VHP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disinfection of protective equipment","disinfection of PPRPH","effects of disinfection","disinfection process","disinfection experiments","disinfection procedure","disinfection of various kind of protective equipment","protective equipment fumigation sterilization cabinet","reusability of respiratory protective equipment","air flow","fumigation chamber","study","disinfected PPRPHs","positive pressure respiratory protective hoods","hydrogen peroxide-based fumigation sterilization cabinet","complete sterilization","material physical properties","function","concentration of VHP","m3","surviving Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC","pathogenic microorganism Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC","effect of vaporized hydrogen peroxide","decontamination","paper","method","potential solution","electric supply system","relationship","applicability","little data available","working requirements","biological indicator","treatment","Abstract Concerns"],"language":"en"},

Following intracranial (i.c.) inoculation with either serotype 3 (T3) or serotype 1 (T1) reovirus, increased expression of IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, and myxovirus-resistance protein (Mx1; a prototypical IFN stimulated gene) was observed in mouse brain tissue. Type I IFN receptor deficient mice (IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212)) had accelerated lethality, compared to wildtype (B6wt) controls, following i.c. T1 or T3 challenge. Although viral titers in the brain and eyes of reovirus infected IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice were significantly increased, these mice did not develop neurologic signs or brain injury. In contrast, increased reovirus titers in peripheral tissues (liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and blood) of IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice were associated with severe intestinal and liver injury. These results suggest that reovirus-infected IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice succumb to peripheral disease rather than encephalitis per se. To investigate the potential role of type I IFN in brain tissue, brain slice cultures (BSCs) were prepared from IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice and B6wt controls for ex vivo T3 reovirus infection. Compared to B6wt controls, reoviral replication and virus-induced apoptosis were enhanced in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) BSCs indicating that a type I IFN response, initiated by resident CNS cells, mediates innate viral immunity within the brain. T3 reovirus tropism was extended in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) brains to include dentate neurons, ependymal cells, and meningeal cells indicating that reovirus tropism within the CNS is dependent upon type I interferon signaling.","publish_time":"2011-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dionne, Kalen R.; Galvin, John M.; Schittone, Stephanie A.; Clarke, Penny; Tyler, Kenneth L.","journal":"Journal of NeuroVirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0714db97da44fcef2414b124ebef87c357360b2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7c299b1c2f8c81470a9356c21280b07fb5835191.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3163031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21671121/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13365-011-0038-1; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3163031?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reovirus-infected IFNAR","T3 reovirus infection","T3 reovirus tropism","eyes of reovirus infected IFNAR","IFN-\u03B2","IFN response","brain injury","increased reovirus titers","IFN receptor deficient mice","increased expression of IFN","viral infection","viral titers","mouse brain tissue","B6wt controls","contribution of type","brain slice cultures","prototypical IFN stimulated gene","T3 challenge","resident CNS cells","potential role of type","ependymal cells","meningeal cells","innate viral immunity","systemic viral spread","T1","liver injury","BSCs","reoviral encephalitis","interferon","serotype","peripheral tissues","reoviral replication","peripheral disease","local central nervous system","Mx1","host\u2019s defense","myxovirus-resistance protein","virus-induced apoptosis","kidney","spleen","heart","dentate neurons","brains","wildtype","neurologic signs","contrast","blood","inoculation","results","accelerated lethality"],"language":"en"},

We propose, based on the One Health model, that veterinarians and animal specialists should be involved in a cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fight against this epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Jiumeng; He, Wan-Ting; Wang, Lifang; Lai, Alexander; Ji, Xiang; Zhai, Xiaofeng; Li, Gairu; Suchard, Marc A.; Tian, Jin; Zhou, Jiyong; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo","journal":"Trends Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f547947bf87380c7fab13ba2c663bbbe9e643ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118693.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32359479/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471491420300654; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1471491420300654; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV","humans","Health model","animals","traditional public health intervention measures","recent outbreak of COVID","public health emergency of international concern","concentrated source of transmission","obvious symptoms","SARS-CoV","transfer","intermediate hosts","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","likely experienced adaptive evolution","presence of carriers","low species barrier","Wuhan","fight","vaccines","animal specialists","Similarities of receptor sequence binding","veterinarians","cross-disciplinary collaboration","virological characteristics","antiviral drugs","epidemic","bats"],"language":"en"},

Data were taken from the University of Groningen in-house prescription database (www.iadb.nl) and virological surveillance for the period 1998\u20132006. During influenza and RSV periods excess antibiotic prescriptions were estimated for all age groups. In the age groups 0\u20131 and 2\u20134 years, excess antibiotic prescriptions during periods with elevated RSV activity (65% and 59% of peri-seasonal rates) exceeded the surpluses estimated during the influenza-activity periods (24% and 34% of peri-seasonal rates) while for otologicals excess prescriptions were higher for influenza (22% and 27%) than for RSV (14% and 17%). Among persons of 50 years and older, notably those without medical high-risk conditions, excess prescriptions for cardiovascular medications were estimated during the influenza periods at approximately 10% (this was also already seen in persons aged 45\u201349). Our results may have implications for influenza vaccination policies. In particular, extension of influenza vaccination to groups of non-elderly adults and young children may lower excess prescriptions during these influenza periods for all three types of drug prescriptions investigated.","publish_time":"2009-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Assink, M.D.M.; Kiewiet, J.

Passive immunity provides immediate but short-lived protection, lasting several weeks up to 3 or 4 months. Passive immunity can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta or from breast milk to the gut of the infant. It can also be produced artificially, when antibody preparations derived from sera or secretions of immunized donors or, more recently, different antibody producing platforms are transferred via systemic or mucosal route to nonimmune individuals. Passive immunization has recently become an attractive approach because of the emergence of new and drug-resistant microorganisms, diseases that are unresponsive to drug therapy and individuals with an impaired immune system who are unable to respond to conventional vaccines. This chapter addresses the contributions of natural and artificial acquired passive immunity in understanding the concept of passive immunization. We will mainly focus on administration of antibodies for protection against various infectious agents entering through mucosal surfaces.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marcotte, Harold; Hammarstr\u00F6m, Lennart","journal":"Mucosal Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a50f979c0147ba924271a4ac93df4cf4dd3d9db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150278.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124158474000719; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124158474000719","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["passive immunity","active immunity","concept of passive immunization","transfer of antibodies","administration of antibodies","maternal antibodies","drug therapy","short-lived protection","nonimmune individuals","mucosal surfaces","mucosal route","different antibody","antibody preparations","drug-resistant microorganisms","impaired immune system","adaptive immune response","various infectious agents","diseases","emergence of new","sera","attractive approach","contributions of natural","breast milk","secretions of immunized donors","fetus","platforms","antigen","gut","placenta","weeks","process","infant","conventional vaccines","chapter","months"],"language":"en"},

Its disposition, curious nature, relative freedom from naturally occurring infectious diseases, and adaptability to its environment have contributed to its popularity as a laboratory animal. Gerbils are found in deserts and semiarid geographical regions of the world. The Mongolian gerbils that are available today originated from 20 pairs of captured animals that were maintained in 1935 in a closed, random-bred colony at the Kitasato Institute in Japan. Gerbils have several unique anatomical and physiological features. Mature gerbils are smaller than rats, but larger than mice. Mongolian gerbils are attracted to saliva and use salivary cues to discriminate between siblings and nonsiblings, and females use oral cues in the selection of sociosexual partners. Gerbils have been used as experimental models in a number of areas of biomedical research. Gerbils are excellent subjects for laboratory animal research as they are susceptible to bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens that affect humans and other species. Gerbils may have spontaneous seizures secondary to stress such as handling, cage change, abrupt noises, or changes in the environment. Cystic ovaries are seen commonly in female gerbils over 1 year of age. Gerbils have unique characteristics, which make them appropriate for a number of animal models. Classically, gerbils have been used in research involving stroke, parasitology, infectious diseases, epilepsy, brain development and behavior, and hearing.","publish_time":"2011-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Batchelder, Margaret; Keller, Lynn S.; Sauer, Mary Ball; L.

This protein belongs to a group of viral cysteine-type proteinases and has been shown previously to catalyze proteolysis between a Gly-Gly dipeptide. The amino acid sequence requirements surrounding the HC-Pro C-terminal cleavage site of the tobacco etch virus polyprotein have been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro expression systems. A total of 51 polyprotein derivatives, each differing by the substitution of a single amino acid between the P5 and P2\u2032 positions, were tested for autoproteolytic activity. Substitutions of Tyr (P4), Val (P2), Gly (P1), and Gly (P1\u2032) were found to eliminate or nearly eliminate proteolysis. Substitutions of Thr (P5), Asn (P3), and Met (P2\u2032), on the other hand, were permissive for proteolysis, although the apparent processing rates of some polyproteins containing these alterations were reduced. These results suggest that auto-recognition by HC-Pro involves the interaction of the enzymatic binding site with four amino acids surrounding the cleavage site. Comparison of the homologous sequences of five potyviral polyproteins revealed that the residues essential for processing are strictly conserved, whereas the nonessential residues are divergent. The relationship between HC-Pro and other viral and cellular cysteine-type proteinases is discussed.","publish_time":"1992-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrington, James C.; Herndon, Kerri L.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21c973d572d45c112b1a89e8c1f0f5b2d231d062.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290319K; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290319K","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Thr"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HC-Pro C-terminus","HC-Pro C-terminal cleavage site","P2","Gly-Gly dipeptide","proteolysis","amino acids","enzymatic binding site","single amino acid","group of viral cysteine-type proteinases","P5","virus polyprotein","polyprotein derivatives","P1","amino acid sequence requirements","cellular cysteine-type proteinases","potyviral polyproteins","autoproteolytic mechanism","residues essential","autoproteolytic activity","nonessential residues","Substitutions of Tyr","Substitutions of Thr","apparent processing rates","tobacco","interaction","potyviruses functions","homologous sequences","Asn","differing","P4","P3","Val","positions","auto-recognition","helper component-proteinase","Met","mutagenesis","expression systems","Comparison","results","alterations","hand","total","relationship"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, infection of the LM-K subline leads to virus persistence with reduced cell fusion. We undertook studies designed to elucidate the role of host cell membrane lipid composition and the cytoskeleton in modulating the fusion process and the resultant effect(s) on virus persistence. MHV-induced cell fusion proceeded normally in cells treated with cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs, cytochalasin B and colchicine. Modification of cell membrane fatty acid composition by supplementation of LM-K cells with arachidonic (C-20:4) or palmitic (C-16:0) acids had little effect on the extent of MHV-induced cell fusion or on virus replication. However, supplementation of both cell types with cholesterol (resulting in increased membrane cholesterol/fatty acid ratio) resulted in marked enhancement of virus-mediated cell fusion. The increase in cell membrane cholesterol did not enhance internalization of MHV suggesting that cholesterol primarily modulates a later event. This suggestion was confirmed by demonstrating cholesterol-enhancement of fusion in a contact fusion assay. Cholesterol-supplemented L-2 cells were less productive for virus replication than unsupplemented cells, in agreement with our previous observations that MHV replication is compromised by extensive cytopathic effect. Although cholesterol-supplemented LM-K cells showed increased susceptibility to MHV-mediated cell fusion, the extent of such susceptibility did not approach that observed in L-2 cells. Also, the property of LM-K cells to support MHV persistence was not abolished by cholesterol supplementation. Thus membrane fusion resistance and MHV persistence are modulated but not alleviated by cell membrane cholesterol content.","publish_time":"1988-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daya, Maleki; Cervin, Marguerite; Anderson, Robert","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268228890267X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268228890267X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-mediated cell fusion","MHV-induced cell fusion","extensive cell fusion","reduced cell fusion","cell membrane cholesterol content","cell types","MHV persistence","cholesterol supplementation","increased membrane cholesterol","membrane fusion resistance","MHV replication","fusion process","cholesterol-enhancement","extent of MHV","virus persistence","cholesterol-supplemented LM","virus replication","internalization of MHV","Modification of cell membrane fatty acid composition","unsupplemented cells","contact fusion assay","role of host cell membrane lipid composition","supplementation of LM","marked enhancement of virus","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus","property of LM","acute infection","increased susceptibility","cytoskeleton","resultant effect","extensive cytopathic effect","little effect","fatty acid ratio","subline of mouse fibroblasts results","agreement","drugs","previous observations","cytochalasin B","acids","colchicine","later event","contrast","studies","suggestion"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides. The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. Results: We report in silico identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development. First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of 2019-nCoV 9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential. Conclusions: Given the limited time and resources to develop vaccine and treatments for 2019-nCoV, our work provides a shortlist of candidates for experimental validation and thus can accelerate development pipeline.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hyun-Jung Lee, Chloe; Koohy, Hashem","journal":"F1000Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b43c0006285d8b8135a8c632176b183d3451455c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111504.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.22507.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32269766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA","The Immune Epitope Database"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV peptides identical","mer peptides","immunogenicity of detected peptides","comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides","identified coronavirus","high immunogenicity potential","curated database of viral immunogenic peptides","recognition potential","binding potential","potential targets","novel coronavirus proteome","developed immunogenicity algorithm","immunogenicity predictive models","vaccine development","people","common HLA alleles","T Cell Receptor","T cell assays","Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus","development pipeline","latest report","high degree of similarity","Immune Epitope Database","TCR","positional weight matrices","European population","Chinese","silico identification","experimental validation","shortlist of candidates","SARS CoV","limited time","resources","iPred","serious global health threat","IEDB","NetMHCpan","work","Methods","treatments","Conclusions","Results","deaths","novo search","Background","China"],"language":"en"},

Some case studies regarding the characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19 have been published recently. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk factors of COVID-19. METHODS: Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 % (95CI 81.3\u201389.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1\u201371.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2\u201352.6 %) and 21.4 % (95CI 15.3\u201327.5 %). The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7 % (95CI 6.1\u20139.3 %), hypertension was 15.6 % (95CI 12.6\u201318.6 %), cardiovascular disease was 4.7 % (95CI 3.1\u20136.2 %), and malignancy was 1.2 % (95CI 0.5\u20131.8 %). The complications, including ARDS risk, ranged from 5.6\u201313.2 %, with the pooled estimate of ARDS risk at 9.4 %, ACI at 5.8 % (95CI 0.7\u201310.8 %), AKI at 2.1 % (95CI 0.6\u20133.7 %), and shock at 4.7 % (95CI 0.9\u20138.6 %). The risks of severity and mortality ranged from 12.6 to 23.5% and from 2.0 to 4.4 %, with pooled estimates at 18.0 and 3.2 %, respectively. The percentage of critical cases in diabetes and hypertension was 44.5 % (95CI 27.0\u201361.9 %) and 41.7 % (95CI 26.4\u201356.9 %), respectively. CONCLUSION: Fever is the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19. The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the severity of COVID-19. ARDS and ACI may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery.

Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large, and there are still a large number of patients dying. With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is also an important cause of death. Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Tocilizumab is a blocker of IL-6R, which can effectively block IL-6 signal transduction pathway.

MERS-CoV replication depends in part on a virus-encoded papain-like protease (PL(pro)) that cleaves the viral replicase polyproteins at three sites releasing non-structural protein 1 (nsp1), nsp2, and nsp3. In addition to this replicative function, MERS-CoV PL(pro) was recently shown to be a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and to possess deISGylating activity, as previously reported for other coronaviral PL(pro) domains, including that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. These activities have been suggested to suppress host antiviral responses during infection. To understand the molecular basis for ubiquitin (Ub) recognition and deconjugation by MERS-CoV PL(pro), we determined its crystal structure in complex with Ub. Guided by this structure, mutations were introduced into PL(pro) to specifically disrupt Ub binding without affecting viral polyprotein cleavage, as determined using an in trans nsp3\u21934 cleavage assay. Having developed a strategy to selectively disable PL(pro) DUB activity, we were able to specifically examine the effects of this activity on the innate immune response. Whereas the wild-type PL(pro) domain was found to suppress IFN-\u03B2 promoter activation, PL(pro) variants specifically lacking DUB activity were no longer able to do so. These findings directly implicate the DUB function of PL(pro), and not its proteolytic activity per se, in the inhibition of IFN-\u03B2 promoter activity. The ability to decouple the DUB activity of PL(pro) from its role in viral polyprotein processing now provides an approach to further dissect the role(s) of PL(pro) as a viral DUB during MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2014-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bailey-Elkin, Ben A.; Knaap, Robert C.

We hypothesized that axonal damage recruits inflammatory cells to sites of Wallerian degeneration, leading to demyelination. Three weeks after TMEV infection, axonal degeneration was induced in the posterior funiculus of mice by injecting the toxic lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) I into the sciatic nerve. Neuropathology was examined 1 week after lectin injection. Control mice, infected with TMEV but receiving no RCA I, had inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the anterior/lateral funiculi. Other control mice that received RCA I alone did not develop inflammatory lesions. In contrast, RCA I injection into TMEV-infected mice induced lesions in the posterior funiculus in addition to the anterior/lateral funiculi. We found no differences in lymphoproliferative responses or antibody titers against TMEV among the groups. This suggests that axonal degeneration contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system by altering the local microenvironment.

Some cats were also tested for feline leukaemia virus antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus, and Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. The effect of these variables on FCoV seropositivity was explored by multivariable logistic regression.

Overall FCoV seropositivity was associated with time spent in a shelter but this association was not linear. Cats that had spent more than 60 days in a shelter were over five times as likely to be seropositive. This may be the result of a change in husbandry from solitary to communal housing for cats remaining in shelters long term. Rescue of cats for less than 60 days was not associated with a significant increasing risk of seropositivity. Significant variation existed in seropositivity between individual shelters overall and in cats rescued for less than 5 days.

The fact that no epidemic occurred in returning Hajj pilgrims in either 2012 or 2013 contradicts the long persistence of the virus in human populations.

These kinds of terminologies are considered useful for standardizing terms and encoding data and are currently used in many existing information systems. However, they suffer from a number of limitations that make data reuse difficult. Relatively recently, it has been proposed that formal ontological methods can be applied to some of the problems of terminological design. Biomedical ontologies organize concepts (embodiments of knowledge about biomedical reality) whereas terminologies organize terms (what is used to code patient data at a certain point in time, based on the particular terminology version). However, the application of these methods to existing terminologies is not straightforward. The use of these terminologies is firmly entrenched in many systems, and what might seem to be a simple option of replacing these terminologies is not possible. Moreover, these terminologies evolve over time in order to suit the needs of users. Any methodology must therefore take these constraints into consideration, hence the need for formal methods of managing changes. Along these lines, we have developed a formal representation of the concept-term relation, around which we have also developed a methodology for management of terminology changes. The objective of this study was to determine whether our methodology would result in improved retrieval of data. DESIGN: Comparison of two methods for retrieving data encoded with terms from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM), based on their recall when retrieving data for ICD-9-CM terms whose codes had changed but which had retained their original meaning (code change). MEASUREMENTS: Recall and interclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were detected (p\u003C0.05) with the McNemar test for two terms whose codes had changed. Furthermore, when all the cases are combined in an overall category, our method also performs statistically significantly better (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that an ontology-based ICD-9-CM data retrieval method that takes into account the effects of terminology changes performs better on recall than one that does not in the retrieval of data for terms whose codes had changed but which retained their original meaning.","publish_time":"2011-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Alexander C.; Cimino, James J.","journal":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21f61bca508bbd911b1d623e9d6c2b0eb4af77c2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c14160d7c97c5cf7b4d0bee2a31da3d838e5cb4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3440000.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2011.01.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046411000074; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046411000074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21262390/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2655821?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Classification of Diseases"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["collections of terms","standardizing terms","data retrieval method","improved retrieval of data","kinds of terminologies","code patient data","existing controlled terminologies","formal methods","data reuse difficult","methodology","codes","recall","formal ontological methods","effects of terminology changes","management of terminology changes","ontology-based ICD","time","formal representation","study","original meaning","OBJECTIVE","existing information systems","particular terminology version","biomedical reality","Biomedical ontologies","code change","simple list","simple option","problems of terminological design","embodiments of knowledge","account","concepts","certain point","International Classification of Diseases","order","concept-term relation","number of limitations","McNemar test","significant differences","overall category","constraints","consideration","Comparison","needs of users","MEASUREMENTS","correlation coefficient","RESULTS","cases","hierarchy","application","CONCLUSION","lines"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Adults \u226560 years old seeking outpatient care for acute respiratory illness were recruited from 2004\u20132005 through 2015\u20132016 during the winter seasons. RSV was identified from respiratory swabs by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were ascertained by interview and medical record abstraction. The incidence of medically attended RSV was estimated for each seasonal cohort. RESULTS: RSV was identified in 243 (11%) of 2257 enrollments (241 of 1832 individuals), including 121 RSV type A and 122 RSV type B. The RSV clinical outcome was serious in 47 (19%), moderate in 155 (64%), and mild in 41 (17%). Serious outcomes included hospital admission (n = 29), emergency department visit (n = 13), and pneumonia (n = 23) and were associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms during the enrollment visit. Moderate outcomes included receipt of a new antibiotic prescription (n = 144; 59%), bronchodilator/nebulizer (n = 45; 19%), or systemic corticosteroids (n = 28; 12%). The relative risk of a serious outcome was significantly increased in persons aged \u226575 years (vs 60\u201364 years) and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure. The average seasonal incidence was 139 cases/10 000, and it was significantly higher in persons with cardiopulmonary disease compared with others (rate ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.44\u20132.48).

We consider that the SRV-4 crossed the so-called species barrier between cynomolgus and Japanese macaques, leading to extremely severe acute symptoms in the latter. Infectious agents that cross the species barrier occasionally amplify in virulence, which is not observed in the original hosts. In such cases, the new hosts are usually distantly related to the original hosts. However, Japanese macaques are closely related to cynomolgus macaques, and can even hybridize when given the opportunity. This lethal outbreak of a novel pathogen in Japanese macaques highlights the need to modify our expectations about virulence with regards crossing species barriers.","publish_time":"2015-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Okamoto, Munehiro; Miyazawa, Takayuki; Morikawa, Shigeru; Ono, Fumiko; Nakamura, Shota; Sato, Eiji; Yoshida, Tomoyuki; Yoshikawa, Rokusuke; Sakai, Kouji; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Nagata, Noriyo; Takano, Jun-ichiro; Okabayashi, Sachi; Hamano, Masataka; Fujimoto, Koji; Nakaya, Takaaki; Iida, Tetsuya; Horii, Toshihiro; Miyabe-Nishiwaki, Takako; Watanabe, Akino; Kaneko, Akihisa; Saito, Akatsuki; Matsui, Atsushi; Hayakawa, Toshiyuki; Suzuki, Juri; Akari, Hirofumi; Matsuzawa, Tetsuro; Hirai, Hirohisa","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0093f9ae0861afc0d29fff935ae6a3af898cea00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4351523.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25743183/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep08850","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Primate Research Institute","Kyoto University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Japanese macaques","cynomolgus macaques","SRV","original hosts","so-called species barrier","species barriers","virulence","new hosts","severe thrombocytopenia","lethal outbreak","lethal hemorrhagic syndrome","severe acute symptoms","Primate Research Institute","novel pathogen","simian retrovirus type","need","Extensive investigation","Kyoto University","regards","expectations","Infectious agents","causative agent","disease","cases","opportunity"],"language":"en"},

Results: Two major components of LI were identified as liquiritin (1) and glycyrrhizin (2); total flavones and flavonols were shown as its minor constituents. The LI (100-800 \u03BCg/ml) stimulated the expression of CD69 on lymphocytes in a concentration-independent manner.

SSPE develops after prolonged persistence of mutated MeV called SSPE virus. Although a combination therapy using interferon and inosiplex or ribavirin appears to prolong survival time to some extent, there is currently no effective treatment to completely cure SSPE and a new treatment strategy is greatly needed. In this study, we adopted RNA interference (RNAi) strategy and examined whether small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can be used to inhibit replication of MeV and SSPE virus. We report here that siRNAs targeted against L mRNA of MeV, either synthetic siRNAs or those generated by pcPUR\u002BU6i-based expression plasmids, effectively and specifically inhibited replication of both MeV and SSPE virus without exhibiting any cytotoxic effect. The L protein of MeV is a major component of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for viral RNA replication, and yet it is least abundant among all the MeV proteins expressed. Therefore, mRNA encoding the L protein would be a good target for RNAi strategy. The present results imply the possibility that our siRNAs against MeV L mRNA are among the potential candidates to be used to treat patients with SSPE.","publish_time":"2006-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otaki, Momoko; Sada, Kiyonao; Kadoya, Hiroyasu; Nagano-Fujii, Motoko; Hotta, Hak","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4b8d416737b7b204d582699cab25f9b5eccc90b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114231.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354206000295; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354206000295","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SSPE virus","replication of MeV","mRNA of MeV","protein of MeV","MeV proteins","prolonged persistence of mutated MeV","viral RNA replication","RNA interference","RNAi strategy","synthetic siRNAs","dependent RNA polymerase","major component of RNA","inhibited replication","new treatment strategy","fatal outcome of measles virus","effective treatment","pcPUR","ribavirin","inosiplex","U6i-based expression plasmids","small interfering RNAs","Abstract Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis","interferon","good target","possibility","survival time","combination therapy","extent","potential candidates","cytotoxic effect","infection","present results","study","patients"],"language":"en"},

To determine the prevalence of HBoV infection in patients with LRTI in Shanghai and its correlation with disease severity, we performed a 3-year prospective study of HBoV in healthy controls, outpatients and inpatients under five years of age with X-ray diagnosed LRTIs. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested by PCR for common respiratory viruses and by real time PCR for HBoV subtypes 1\u20134. Nasopharyngeal swabs from healthy controls and serum samples and stools from inpatients were also tested for HBoV1-4 by real time PCR. Viral loads were determined by quantitative real time PCR in all HBoV positive samples. HBoV1 was detected in 7.0% of inpatients, with annual rates of 5.1%, 8.0% and 4.8% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subtype A was the most frequent co-infection detected; HBoV1 and RSVA appeared to co-circulate with similar seasonal variations. High HBoV viral loads (\u003E10(6) copies/ml) were significantly more frequent in inpatients and outpatients than in healthy controls. There was a direct correlation of high viral load with increasing disease severity in patients co-infected with HBoV1 and at least one other respiratory virus. In summary, our data suggest that HBoV1 can cause LRTIs, but symptomatic HBoV infection is only observed in the context of high viral load.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Baihui; Yu, Xuelian; Wang, Chuanxian; Teng, Zheng; Wang, Chun; Shen, Jiaren; Gao, Ye; Zhu, Zhaokui; Wang, Jiayu; Yuan, Zhengan; Wu, Fan; Zhang, Xi; Ghildyal, Reena","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7150b10d52da822055fd899a9df210131bf8104e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3640090.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23638038/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI","PCR","RSVA"],"locations":["Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["HBoV1","High HBoV viral loads","symptomatic HBoV infection","prevalence of HBoV infection","HBoV subtypes","inpatients","respiratory illness","frequent co-infection","HBoV positive samples","high incidence of co-infection","healthy controls","LRTIs","common respiratory viruses","Respiratory syncytial virus","quantitative real time PCR","context of high viral load","direct correlation of high viral load","year prospective study of HBoV","patients co-infected","lower respiratory tract infections","outpatients","increasing disease severity","serum samples","Nasopharyngeal swabs","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","Shanghai","stools","RSVA","years of age","pathogenic role","parvovirus","similar seasonal variations","X-ray","data","Human bocavirus","annual rates","summary","copies"],"language":"en"},

The occurrence and the diversity of swine PV were therefore investigated in pig slurry collected in Italy, to contribute towards filling this gap in knowledge. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty\u2010two slurry samples underwent analysis by nested PCR and DNA sequencing using published and newly designed specific primer pairs for Sus scrofa papillomavirus (SsPV) type 1 and 2 (SsPV1 and 2), along with degenerate PV\u2010specific primers targeting the major coat protein L1 and the helicase protein E1. Overall, three samples (13\u00B76%) were positive for SsPV1 by specific primers, and nucleotide (nt) sequences showed 99\u2013100% nt identity with SsPV1 variant a (EF395818), while SsPV2 was not found in any sample. Using generic primers, eight samples (36\u00B74%) were tested positive for human papillomavirus (HPV), and were characterized as follows: \u03B21\u2010HPV8, \u03B21\u2010HPV14, \u03B21\u2010HPV206, \u03B22\u2010HPV113, \u03B22\u2010HPV120 and \u03B31\u2010HPV173. Moreover, one unclassified \u03B3\u2010type was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Both swine and human PVs were detected in pig slurry in this study. The unexpected presence of HPV in pig waste could be explained as the result of an improper use of the sewage collection pits and/or with improper procedures of the operators. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reports the first detection of SsPV1 in Italy, along with the first detection of HPVs in pig slurry samples in Italy, and expands our knowledge about PV diversity and geographic distribution.","publish_time":"2019-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Bonito, P.; Galati, L.; Foc\u00E0, A.; Brambilla, M.; Bisaglia, C.; Bonanno Ferraro, G.; Mancini, P.; Iaconelli, M.; Veneri, C.; La Rosa, G.","journal":"J Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8567694a807246d207bef90298158dfd975ab77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166630.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251456/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jam.14363","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pig slurry samples","specific primers","\u03B21","diversity of swine PV","PV diversity","detection of SsPV1","Italy","study","pig waste","SsPV1 variant","\u03B22","human papillomavirus","human PVs","generic primers","degenerate PV","type","knowledge","geographical distribution of swine papillomaviruses","designed specific primer pairs","improper use","geographic distribution","detection of HPVs","improper procedures","nt identity","Sus scrofa papillomavirus","helicase protein E1","unexpected presence of HPV","major coat protein L1","analysis","nested PCR","DNA sequencing","HPV113","HPV206","HPV14","sewage collection pits","HPV120","nucleotide","\u03B31","EF395818","RESULTS","HPV8","HPV173","sequences","IMPACT","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","occurrence","SsPV2","unclassified \u03B3","operators","SIGNIFICANCE","gap"],"language":"en"},

Many of the data pertaining to fatty acid acylation of eukaryotic cell membrane proteins come from studies with those glycoproteins that form the external spikes on enveloped RNA animal viruses. The procedures for detecting and identifying protein-bound fatty acids rely primarily on incorporating high specific radioactive labeled fatty acids into growing tissue culture cells and analyzing proteins from these cells by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. The function of fatty acid in membrane proteins is unknown, and it is believed that fatty acid acylation might be important for proper intracellular transport of proteins destined to be localized to the plasma membrane.","publish_time":"1983-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schlesinger, Milton J.","journal":"Methods in Enzymology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66837ef0f45db9c2b549d9180ac1957ef7f476aa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0076687983960676; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0076687983960676","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of fatty acid","distribution of fatty acid acylated proteins","mechanism of fatty acid acylation","fatty acid acylation of eukaryotic cell membrane proteins","overview of fatty acid acylation of eukaryotic cell proteins","high specific radioactive labeled fatty acids","proper intracellular transport of proteins","chapter","plasma membrane","growing tissue culture cells","external spikes","SDS","sodium dodecyl sulfate","electrophoresis","site","analysis","enveloped RNA animal viruses","studies","data pertaining","glycoproteins","polyacrylamide gels","Publisher Summary","procedures"],"language":"en"},

Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The objectives of this study were: to update and re-assess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and b) Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome in any population; and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality. Methods and findings The study had three linked components. First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in 10 dimensions; temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response, animal experiments, analogy, specificity and consistency. Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, a multidisciplinary panel of experts assessed the review findings and reached consensus on causality. We found 1091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of 10 causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity) we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection. For Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity and animal experimental evidence). Articles identified non-systematically from May 30-July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that: a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including 61 microcephaly; and b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome. The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible co-factors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research. Conclusions Rapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed, both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge. This rapid systematic review found sufficient evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of Guillain-Barr\u00E9 situation.","publish_time":"2016-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krauer, Fabienne; Riesen, Maurane; Reveiz, Ludovic; Oladapo, Olufemi T; Mart\u00EDnez-Vega, Ruth; Porgo, Teegwend\u00E9 V.; Haefliger, Anina; Broutet, Nathalie J; Low, Nicola","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/073098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background The World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outbreaks of Zika virus infection","sufficient evidence","summarised evidence","cause of congenital abnormalities","cause of congenital brain abnormalities","rapid systematic review","rapid evidence assessments","causality dimensions","role of dengue virus","systematic assessment","trigger of Guillain","review findings","neurological disorder Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome","animal experimental evidence","likely explanation of available evidence","Barr\u00E9 situation","causality framework","expert assessment","systematic reviews","clusters of microcephaly","dose-response relationship","specificity","relevant studies","expert panel","public health actions","public health measures","public health threats","quality assessment","limited assessment","causal association","Conclusions Rapid","strength of association","study selection","Methods","World Health Organization","unique items","small number of comparative epidemiological studies","multidisciplinary panel of experts","animal experiments","clinical outcomes","scientific consensus","protocol number CRD42016036693","possible co-factors","frequent updating","temporality","alternative explanations","data extraction","cessation","biological plausibility","links","pregnancy","offspring of pregnant women","analogy","questions","pace of publication","open dissemination","foetuses","difficulty","process","mosquito","population","new research","consistency","date","linked components","Decisions","appraisal","multiple online sources","Weaknesses","Articles","objectives"],"language":"en"},

In our previous study, immunization of mice with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) spike (S) DNA vaccine could induce both humoral and cellular immunity in response to a pool of entire overlapping S peptides. Identification of functional dominant epitopes in SARS CoV S protein for T cells is crucial for further understanding of cellular immune responses elicited by SARS CoV S DNA vaccine. In present study, mice were immunized with SARS CoV S DNA vaccine. Subsequently, a pool of 17\u201319 mers overlapped SARS CoV S peptides, which served as immunogens, were scanned to identify the specific epitopes for T cells. Two H-2d restricted CD4\u002B T epitopes, N60 (S435\u2013444) and P152 (S1111\u20131127), and two H-2d restricted CD8\u002B T cell epitopes, N50 (S365\u2013374) and P141 (S1031\u20131047) were identified by three different methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) and fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). The dominant CD4\u002B T cell epitope (N60) and CD8\u002B T cell epitope (N50) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS CoV S protein, which mediated virus combining and fusing to susceptible cells. Importantly, our novel finding is that mice primed with SARS S DNA vaccine and boosted with T cell epitopes (N50 and N60) could promote antigen specific CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cell immune responses.

Our team previously identified 14-3-3\u03B5 protein as a subchondral bone soluble mediator altering cartilage homeostasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of CD13 (also known as aminopeptidase N, APN) in the chondrocyte response to 14-3-3\u03B5. After identifying CD13 in chondrocytes, we knocked down CD13 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) and blocking antibodies in articular chondrocytes. 14-3-3\u03B5-induced MMP-3 and MMP-13 was significantly reduced with CD13 knockdown, which suggests that it has a crucial role in 14-3-3\u03B5 signal transduction. Aminopeptidase N activity was identified in chondrocytes, but the activity was unchanged after stimulation with 14-3-3\u03B5. Direct interaction between CD13 and 14-3-3\u03B5 was then demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance. Using labeled 14-3-3\u03B5, we also found that 14-3-3\u03B5 binds to the surface of chondrocytes in a manner that is dependent on CD13. Taken together, these results suggest that 14-3-3\u03B5 might directly bind to CD13, which transmits its signal in chondrocytes to induce a catabolic phenotype similar to that observed in osteoarthritis. The 14-3-3\u03B5\u2013CD13 interaction could be a new therapeutic target in osteoarthritis.","publish_time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nefla, Meriam; Sudre, Laure; Denat, Guillaume; Priam, Sabrina; Andre-Leroux, Gwena\u00EBlle; Berenbaum, Francis; Jacques, Claire","journal":"J Cell Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4582189.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26208633/; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.169573","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B5 protein","CD13 interaction","involvement of CD13","CD13 knockdown","\u03B5-induced MMP","\u03B5 signal transduction","articular chondrocytes","surface of chondrocytes","Osteoarthritis","cartilage homeostasis","Aminopeptidase N activity","progressive destruction of articular cartilage","subchondral bone soluble mediator","Direct interaction","surface plasmon resonance","abnormal communication","siRNA","new therapeutic target","small interfering RNA","joint disease","APN","antibodies","catabolic phenotype similar","manner","chondrocyte response","study","stimulation","crucial role","aim","results","team"],"language":"en"},

Increasing rates of new syphilis cases per year have been observed recently. RESULTS: The genome of the SS14 strain was sequenced to high accuracy by an oligonucleotide array strategy requiring hybridization to only three arrays (Comparative Genome Sequencing, CGS). Gaps in the resulting sequence were filled with targeted dideoxy-terminators (DDT) sequencing and the sequence was confirmed by whole genome fingerprinting (WGF). When compared to the Nichols strain, 327 single nucleotide substitutions (224 transitions, 103 transversions), 14 deletions, and 18 insertions were found. On the proteome level, the highest frequency of amino acid-altering substitution polymorphisms was in novel genes, while the lowest was in housekeeping genes, as expected by their evolutionary conservation. Evidence was also found for hypervariable regions and multiple regions showing intrastrain heterogeneity in the T. pallidum chromosome. CONCLUSION: The observed genetic changes do not have influence on the ability of Treponema pallidum to cause syphilitic infection, since both SS14 and Nichols are virulent in rabbit. However, this is the first assessment of the degree of variation between the two syphilis pathogens and paves the way for phylogenetic studies of this fascinating organism.","publish_time":"2008-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mat\u011Bjkov\u00E1, Petra; Strouhal, Michal; \u0160majs, David; Norris, Steven J; Palzkill, Timothy; Petrosino, Joseph F; Sodergren, Erica; Norton, Jason E; Singh, Jaz; Richmond, Todd A; Molla, Michael N; Albert, Thomas J; Weinstock, George M","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0132b8c2721692d9f53bd33a738fa94618bb4e91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2408589.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-8-76; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18482458/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nichols"],"organizations":["Comparative Genome Sequencing"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum","pallidum chromosome","ability of Treponema pallidum","SS14 strain","syphilis pathogens","Nichols strain","Comparative Genome Sequencing","genome fingerprinting","hypervariable regions","multiple regions","rates of new syphilis cases","resulting sequence","novel genes","housekeeping genes","observed genetic changes","intrastrain heterogeneity","high accuracy","arrays","influence","highest frequency of amino acid","substitution polymorphisms","oligonucleotide array strategy","enigmatic pathogen","single nucleotide substitutions","hybridization","targeted dideoxy-terminators","way","DDT","syphilitic infection","phylogenetic studies","transitions","year","CGS","BACKGROUND","fascinating organism","proteome level","virulence factors","degree of variation","transversions","CONCLUSION","rabbit","deletions","pathogenesis","assessment","Gaps","Evidence","WGF","RESULTS","evolutionary conservation"],"language":"en"},

In the majority of naturally infected animals, FCoV infection remains subclinical and is associated with generalised B and T cell hyperplasia, but no other pathological findings. A minority of cats, however, develop feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal systemic granulomatous disease. This is generally accompanied by B and T cell depletion. The obvious functional differences of lymphatic tissues in FCoV-infected cats with and without FIP suggest that they contribute to the outcome of FCoV infection. This study attempted to evaluate the functional changes in haemolymphatic tissues after natural FCoV infection, with special emphasis on the magnitude, phenotype and function of the monocyte/macrophage population. The spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow from naturally FCoV-infected cats with and without FIP and specific pathogen-free (SPF) control cats were examined for the quantity and activation state of monocytes/macrophages both by immunohistology and by quantitative real time PCR for the transcription of interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) and GM-CSF. Compared to cats with FIP, FCoV-infected cats without FIP exhibited significantly higher IL-10 levels in the spleen and significantly lower levels of IL-6, G- and M-CSF in mesenteric lymph nodes. In cats with FIP, however, IL-12 p40 levels were significantly lower in lymphatic tissues in comparison to both SPF cats and FCoV-infected cats without FIP. In comparison to SPF cats, FIP cats had significantly higher IL-1\u03B2 levels and lower TNF levels in mesenteric lymph nodes and lower M-CSF levels in the spleen. Findings indicate that FCoV-infected cats which do not develop FIP are able to mount an effective FCoV-specific immune response and can avoid excessive macrophage activation and FIP, possibly by upregulation of IL-10 production. Development of FIP, however, might be due to a lack of IL-12 which inhibits an effective cellular immune response and allows for monocyte/macrophage activation and the development of FIP.","publish_time":"2006-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kipar, Anja; Meli, Marina L.; Failing, Klaus; Euler, Tatjana; Gomes-Keller, Maria A.; Schwartz, Dirk; Lutz, Hans; Reinacher, Manfred","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb672292b64148c93413db50a61a023707616423.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112699.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242706000560; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242706000560","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GM","CSF","TNF","FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIP cats","FCoV-infected cats","SPF cats","Development of FIP","lower levels of IL","control cats","minority of cats","CSF levels","higher IL","upregulation of IL","lack of IL","natural FCoV infection","outcome of FCoV infection","macrophage-CSF","lower TNF levels","\u03B2 levels","p40 levels","G-CSF","effective FCoV-specific immune response","infected animals","GM-CSF","mesenteric lymph nodes","spleen","excessive macrophage activation","macrophage population","haemolymphatic tissues","monocyte-associated viraemia","systemic proliferation of monocytes","comparison","activation state of monocytes","macrophages","obvious functional differences of lymphatic tissues","effective cellular immune response","systemic viral spread","T cell hyperplasia","T cell depletion","functional changes","fatal systemic granulomatous disease","generalised B","pathological findings","tumour necrosis factor","experimental feline coronavirus","specific pathogen-free","feline infectious peritonitis","bone marrow","immunohistology","granulocyte colony","special emphasis","quantitative real time PCR","transcription of interleukin","phenotype","quantity","magnitude","majority","study","production"],"language":"en"},

Although there long has been substantial interest in the associations between city living and health, relatively little work has tried to understand how and why cities affect population health. This reflects both the number and complexity of determinants and of the absence of a unified framework that integrates the multiple factors that influence the health of urban populations. This paper presents a conceptual framework for studying how urban living affects population health. The framework rests on the assumption that urban populations are defined by size, density, diversity, and complexity, and that health in urban populations is a function of living conditions that are in turn shaped by municipal determinants and global and national trends. The framework builds on previous urban health research and incorporates multiple determinants at different levels. It is intended to serve as a model to guide public health research and intervention.","publish_time":"2005-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galea, Sandro; Freudenberg, Nicholas; Vlahov, David","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd7a81e01264de507007efb1e88f673497cf76d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117054.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953604003223; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953604003223","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health of urban populations","urban living","population health","previous urban health research","urban areas","public health research","non-urban residents","multiple determinants","complexity of determinants","unified framework","conceptual framework","framework rests","municipal determinants","world\u0027s population","cities","function of living conditions","multiple factors","growing influence","turn","national trends","city","density","size","absence","assumption","different levels","diversity","associations","model","intervention","little work","majority","paper","number"],"language":"en"},

AIV infection of macrophages was required to activate T lymphocytes and prior in vivo exposure of chickens to NP AIV plasmid enhanced responses to infected macrophages. This study suggests that the demonstrated T lymphocyte activation is in part due to antigen presentation by the macrophages as well as cytokine release by the infected macrophages, with B2 haplotypes showing stronger activation. These responses were present both in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes. In contrast, T lymphocytes stimulated by ConA showed greater IFN\u03B3 release of B19 haplotype cells, further indicating the greater responses in B2 haplotypes to infection is due to macrophages, but not T cells. In summary, resistance of B2 haplotype chickens appears to be directly linked to a more vigorous innate immune response and the role macrophages play in activating adaptive immunity.","publish_time":"2016-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Collisson, Ellen; Griggs, Lisa; Drechsler, Yvonne","journal":"Dev Comp Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cc3ab35fde19a1e8e4ccff32b49ff7b9a9b42ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102680.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X16302920; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2016.09.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X16302920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27746172/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected macrophages","T cells","AIV infection of macrophages","role macrophages","B2 haplotypes","CD8 T lymphocytes","greater responses","demonstrated T lymphocyte activation","resistance of B2 haplotype chickens","macrophage responses","B19 haplotypes","greater IFN\u03B3 release of B19 haplotype cells","exposure of chickens","cytokine release","stronger activation","NP AIV plasmid enhanced responses","coronavirus-induced infection","current study","ConA","complex","differential ex","clinical illness","CD4","vigorous innate immune response","respiratory pathogens","MHC","summary","adaptive immunity","contrast","antigen presentation"],"language":"en"},

Real-time technology and the ability to perform multiplex testing have facilitated this emergence. Commercial platforms for nucleic acid amplification testing of respiratory viruses include real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Multiplex PCR with fluidic microarrays or DNA chips are the most recent diagnostic advance. These assays offer significant advantages in sensitivity over antigen detection methods and in most cases also over traditional culture methods.

In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2013-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Safronetz, David; Geisbert, Thomas W.; Feldmann, Heinz","journal":"Current Opinion in Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb05d25a4435d69e6d48bd140252a19c339ac8e8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/086e29b23e033f4fb42e9c8a13f7088d87efd13f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3644300.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23403208/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3644300?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625713000023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625713000023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2013.01.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["southern Africa","China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["animal models of disease","emerging viral pathogens","current status of disease models","pathogenesis of disease","humans","Thrombocytopenia virus","Lujo virus","potential targets","potential efficacy","southern Africa","Severe fever","intervention","China","respect","high morbidity","overall goal","best predictive data","order","SARS","recent examples","human condition","specific therapeutics","infections","opportunities","coronavirus","mortality","insight","understanding","appropriate medical countermeasures","diseases","vaccines"],"language":"en"},

Coronavirus infection of cultured cells was previously shown to cause ER stress and induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), a process that aims to restore the ER homeostasis by global translation shutdown and increasing the ER folding capacity. However, under prolonged ER stress, UPR can also induce apoptotic cell death. Accumulating evidence from recent studies has shown that induction of ER stress and UPR may constitute a major aspect of coronavirus\u2013host interaction. Activation of the three branches of UPR modulates a wide variety of signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, autophagy, apoptosis, and innate immune response. ER stress and UPR activation may therefore contribute significantly to the viral replication and pathogenesis during coronavirus infection. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on coronavirus-induced ER stress and UPR activation, with emphasis on their cross-talking to apoptotic signaling.","publish_time":"2014-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fung, To S.; Liu, Ding X.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9761b5e2c50841879b9ec0fff753ec88ece36744.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4060729.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24987391/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UPR activation","coronavirus-induced ER stress","induction of ER stress","prolonged ER stress","ER homeostasis","branches of UPR","replication of coronavirus","ER folding capacity","kinase activation","major aspect of coronavirus","Coronavirus infection of cultured cells","unfolded protein response","viral replication","mitogen-activated protein","innate immune response","apoptotic cell death","autophagy","apoptosis","MAP","global translation shutdown","current knowledge","family of important animal","recent studies","endoplasmic reticulum","pathways","human pathogens","host interaction","wide variety","pathogenesis","emphasis","cellular membrane compartments","Accumulating evidence","cross","process","review"],"language":"en"},

Neuroenzyme activities in the lacrimal gland are influenced by ocular infections, leading to reduced expression of acetylcholine and modulation of receptors on acinar cells and on plasma cells, thereby decreasing fluid and immunoglobulin secretion. T lymphocyte-dependent responses result in production of interleukin-4 in lacrimal glands, thereby influencing cholinergic enzyme activity affecting immune processes and lacrimal physiology. Furthermore, neuropeptides released into lymphoid structures or inflamed tissues are chemotactic for antigen-presenting cells and affect their interactions with T cells.

This review covers those key areas and looks at the latest approaches using high\u2010throughput quantitative proteomics of the nucleolus in virus infected cells to gain an insight into the role of this fascinating compartment in viral infection.","publish_time":"2010-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hiscox, Julian A.; Whitehouse, Adrian; Matthews, David A.","journal":"Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81636aae01bd5383ce05890bf7bd0dd14c105342.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167898.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201000251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20661956/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleolus","cell cycle","viral proteins","areas of cell function","eukaryotic cell biology","cell stress response","viral infection","viral replication","growing body of data","growing body of evidence","wide role","key areas","plant cells","throughput quantitative proteomics","cellular nucleolar proteins","virus infected cells","ribosome generation","latest approaches","modulation","regulation","isolation of nucleoli","mammalian","insight","order","traditional methods","fascinating compartment","immune responses","viruses","Recent advances"],"language":"en"},

Thus, the goal of this study is to better characterize AM phenotype of allergic asthmatic compared with normal subjects using genomic expression analyses. Microarray analyses were performed with AM isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage. Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) normalization and Smyth\u0027s moderated t test were used to select differentially expressed genes. Fifty differentially expressed genes were identified. Nineteen have been classified in categories linked to stress or immune responses and among them; nine are part of the heat shock protein (HSP) family. Difference of expression for three (HSPD1, PRNP, SERPINH1) of the five selected genes were validated using real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the protein level of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), the protein encoded by HSPD1, and showed difference in AM protein level between allergic asthmatic and control subjects. In summary, this study suggests that HSP gene family, particularly HSP60, is involved in AM functions in a context of allergic asthma. These results also support the involvement of AM immune functions in the development of an allergic asthmatic response.","publish_time":"2010-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madore, Anne-Marie; Perron, St\u00E9phanie; Turmel, V\u00E9ronique; Laviolette, Michel; Bissonnette, \u00C9lyse Y.; Laprise, Catherine","journal":"Human Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a942c4423ddefe5cd28d91cf2feb0c8875e8ab8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124256.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19913588/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198885909006363; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0198885909006363; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2009.11.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein level of heat shock protein","phenotype of allergic asthmatic","allergic asthmatic response","context of allergic asthma","HSP60","immune functions","Difference of expression","study","HSPD1","selected genes","HSP gene family","genomic expression analyses","normal subjects","control subjects","immune responses","Microarray analyses","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","normalization","real-time reverse transcription","Smyth\u0027s moderated t test","polymerase chain reaction","development","Robust multiarray analysis","SERPINH1","categories","stress","involvement","PRNP","implication of alveolar macrophages","Th2 disease","summary","bronchoalveolar lavage","results","goal"],"language":"en"},

Following extraction by the two methods, all samples were analyzed by Real-time RT-PCR. Results revealed that the use of the standard Maxwell 16 protocol (Maxwell 16-S) resulted in good linearity and precision across a wide concentration range and higher sensitivity of detection from flu-v stock suspensions than the manual method. Compared with the latter method, Maxwell 16-S extracted RNA more efficiently (higher RNA yield and/or fewer PCR inhibitors) from throat swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, while both methods performed comparably on fecal samples from human and poultry in terms of overall threshold cycle values and detection rates although the Maxwell 16-S co-purified more inhibitors from fecal samples. The capacity of this system to remove inhibitors from fecal matrix was improved by using a modified Maxwell 16 protocol with a reduced sample input, which eliminated all false-negatives produced by the Maxwell 16-S. These findings suggest that the Maxwell 16 System is suitable for RNA extraction from multiple-source samples for diagnosis of influenza and viral load determination and that a proper reduction in starting sample volume may improve the detection of flu-v from complex matrices such as feces.

It has evolved highly specialised functions to address these constant threats whilst facilitating seamless respiratory exchange with the lower respiratory tract. Dysregulation of its critical homeostatic and defence functions can lead to ingress of pathogens into the lower respiratory tract, potentially leading to serious illness. Systems-wide proteomic tools may facilitate a better understanding of mechanisms in the upper airways in health and disease. In this study, we aimed to develop a mass spectrometry based proteomics method for characterizing the upper airways proteome. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples used in all our experiments had been eluted in the Universal Transport Media (UTM) containing significantly high levels of bovine serum albumin. Our proteomic experiments tested the optimal approach to characterize airway proteome on swab samples eluted in UTM based on the number of proteins identified without BSA depletion (Total proteome: Protocol A) and with its depletion using a commercial kit; Allprep, Qiagen (cellular proteome: Protocol B, Ci, and Cii). Observations and lessons drawn from protocol A, fed into the design and implementation of protocol B, and from B to protocol Ci and finally Cii. Label free proteome quantification was used in Protocol A (n = 6) and B (n = 4) while commercial TMT 10plex reagents were used for protocols Ci and ii (n = 83). Protocols Ci and ii were carried out under similar conditions except for the elution gradient: 3 h and 6 h respectively. Swab samples tested in this study were from infants and children with and without upper respiratory tract infections from Kilifi County Hospital on the Kenyan Coast. Protocol A had the least number of proteins identified (215) while B produced the highest number of protein identifications (2396). When Protocol B was modified through sample multiplexing with TMT to enable higher throughput (Protocol Ci), the number of protein identified reduced to 1432. Modification of protocol Ci by increasing the peptide elution time generated Protocol Cii that substantially increased the number of proteins identified to 1875. The coefficient of variation among the TMT runs in Protocol Cii was \u003C20%. There was substantial overlap in the identity of proteins using the four protocols. Our method was were able to identify marker proteins characteristically expressed in the upper airway. We found high expression levels of signature nasopharyngeal and oral proteins, including BPIFA1/2 and AMY1A, as well as a high abundance of proteins related to innate and adaptive immune function in the upper airway.

As the number of cases increased the demand for tests multiplied, leading the CDC to utilize the Emergency Utilization Authorization to allow clinical and commercial laboratories to develop tests to detect the presence of the virus. Many nucleic acid tests based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were developed, each with different techniques, specifications and turnaround time. As the illnesses turned into a pandemic, testing became more crucial. The test supply became inadequate to meet the need that it had to be prioritized according to guidance. For surveillance, the need for serologic tests emerged. Here we review the timeline of test development, the turn-around times, the various approved tests and compare them as regards the genes they detect. We concentrate on the point-of-care tests and discuss the basis for new serologic tests. We discuss the testing guidance for prioritization and their application in a hospital setting. As SARS-CoV-2 virus arrived in the USA causing the COVID-19 illness, one of the most talked about issues in the management of the disease and the resulting pandemic has been clinical testing. A unique situation arose of a communicable and highly contagious disease necessitating the rapid diagnosis of patients and the identification of non-symptomatic infected persons. Unfortunately, the USA did not have a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved laboratory test for the illness. The FDA ultimately utilized its Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) on February 4, 2020 to allow for more rapid and widespread development and implementation of in-vitro testing.1 Indeed, companies and organizations utilized the EUA to file applications for new tests based on different methodologies, amounting to 48 applications in the span of 3 months from the beginning of February to the end of April 2020. In addition, multiple other tests were put in place under a separate authorization by a Presidential memorandum in early March allowing laboratories that carry Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certification to put tests in place without an EUA from the FDA. This created an unprecedented situation where the medical community and the public may not be familiar with the various new tests for COVID-19 that are offered to patients and hospitals. The purpose of this review is to provide information, up-to-date as of the date of submission of the manuscript to the journal, on the various tests that have been developed, their scientific basis and their interpretation. We give a real-world example demonstrating the time lag in the return of test results and review testing prioritization guidance since the supply of tests remains below the perceived need.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ward, Stephanie; Lindsley, Andrew; Courter, Josh; Assa\u2019ad, Amal","journal":"The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39e45782a1d30136cc04498a2ee30d34cf98a9a0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920307296?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.05.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920307296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445839/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Center for Disease Control","CDC","USA","Food and Drug Administration","FDA","Clinical Laboratory"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["various tests","supply of tests","care tests","various new tests","new serologic tests","various approved tests","nucleic acid tests","clinical testing","testing guidance","laboratory test","test supply","review testing prioritization guidance","initial test","EUA","vitro testing","FDA","COVID","timeline of test development","return of test results","contagious disease","place","Disease Control","CDC","perceived need","USA","Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment","Emergency Utilization Authorization","rapid diagnosis of patients","commercial laboratories","time lag","separate authorization","file applications","turnaround time","different techniques","different methodologies","resulting pandemic","widespread development","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","number of cases","scientific basis","unprecedented situation","unique situation","Emergency Use Authorizations","reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","certification","CLIA","identification of non-symptomatic infected persons","Presidential memorandum","implementation","times","RT-PCR","Drug Administration","United States","date of submission","medical community","management","specifications","Food","organizations","companies","journal","beginning","manuscript","public","span","months","Abstract","real-world example","issues","information","Center","demand","surveillance","hospital setting","interpretation","point","addition","illnesses","presence","hospitals","purpose","genes"],"language":"en"},

By sequence analysis of 75 pairs of homologous viral overlapping genes, I evaluated their accordance with one or the other model. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that half of overlaps undergo asymmetric evolution, as the protein from one frame shows a number of substitutions significantly higher than that of the protein from the other frame. Interestingly, the most variable protein (often known to interact with the host proteins) appeared to be encoded by the de novo frame in all cases examined.

Preparedness efforts are hampered by considerable uncertainty about the nature and intensity of human-to-human transmission, with previous reproduction number estimates ranging from 0.4 to 1.5. Here we synthesize epidemiological data and transmission models for the MERS-CoV outbreak during April-October 2013 to resolve uncertainties in epidemic risk, while considering the impact of observation bias. We match the progression of MERS-CoV cases in 2013 to a dynamic transmission model that incorporates community and hospital compartments, and distinguishes transmission by zoonotic (index) cases and secondary cases. When observation bias is assumed to account for the fact that all reported zoonotic cases are severe, but only ~57% of secondary cases are symptomatic, the average reproduction number of MERS-CoV is estimated to be 0.45 (95%CI:0.29\u20130.61). Alternatively, if these epidemiological observations are taken at face value, index cases are estimated to transmit substantially more effectively than secondary cases, (R(i) =0.84 (0.58\u20131.20) vs R(s)=0.36 (0.24\u20130.51)). In both scenarios the relative contribution of hospital-based transmission is over four times higher than that of community transmission, indicating that disease control should be focused on hospitalized patients. Adjusting previously published estimates for observation bias confirms a strong support for the average R \u003C 1 in the first stage of the outbreak in 2013 and thus, transmissibility of secondary cases of MERS-CoV remained well below the epidemic threshold. More information on the observation process is needed to clarify whether MERS-CoV is intrinsically weakly transmissible between people or whether existing control measures have contributed meaningfully to reducing the transmissibility of secondary cases. Our results could help evaluate the progression of MERS-CoV in recent months in response to changes in disease surveillance, control interventions, or viral adaptation.","publish_time":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowell, Gerardo; Blumberg, Seth; Simonsen, Lone; Miller, Mark A.; Viboud, C\u00E9cile","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1d1c5fc9af8db5124f2456fb935a75ff1480b0a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c00dcd6ec7803b35ba7a9db20a2507137abc9d95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4258236.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480133/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2014.09.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436514000607; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436514000607","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV cases","index cases","transmissibility of secondary cases of MERS","MERS-CoV outbreak","progression of MERS","reported zoonotic cases","community transmission","human transmission","based transmission","transmission models","average reproduction number of MERS","dynamic transmission model","impact of observation bias","disease control","observation process","control interventions","vs R","previous reproduction number estimates","existing control measures","disease surveillance","intensity of human","hospital compartments","published estimates","epidemiological data","epidemiological observations","epidemic risk","epidemic threshold","outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","relative contribution of hospital","changes","response","people","recent months","strong support","considerable uncertainty","face value","times higher","nature","viral adaptation","Preparedness efforts","scenarios","laboratory","fact","deaths","hospitalized patients","Arabian Peninsula","uncertainties","information","stage","results","CI"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using Cochrane library. A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline HBA1c and diabetes-related complications data from India-specific database. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyse the relationship between the duration of lockdown and glycaemic targets \u0026 diabetes-related complications. RESULTS: The predictive model was extremely robust (R2 = 0.99) and predicted outcomes for period of lockdown up to 90 days. The predicted increment in HBA1c from baseline at the end of 30 days and 45 days lockdown was projected as 2.26% \u0026 3.68% respectively. Similarly, the annual predicted percentage increase in complication rates at the end of 30-day lockdown was 2.8% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2.9% for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.5% for retinal photocoagulation, 9.3% for microalbuminuria, 14.2% for proteinuria, 2.9% for peripheral neuropathy, 10.5% for lower extremity amputation, 0.9% for myocardial infarction, 0.5% for stroke and 0.5% for infections. CONCLUSION: The duration of lockdown is directly proportional to the worsening of glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications.

We have studied the structure of RUBV factory in three dimensions by electron tomography and freeze-fracture. CPVs contain stacked membranes, rigid sheets, small vesicles and large vacuoles. These membranes are interconnected and in communication with the endocytic pathway since they incorporate endocytosed BSA-gold. RER and CPVs are coupled through protein bridges and closely apposed membranes. Golgi vesicles attach to the CPVs but no tight contacts with mitochondria were detected.

There is increasing evidence that preschool-aged children with viral-induced asthma may display a certain degree of corticosteroid resistance, requiring higher doses of corticosteroids to overcome it. The identification of determinants of responsiveness is complicated by design issues, including heterogeneous populations of children with asthma and bronchiolitis or of children with viral-induced and multi-trigger asthma phenotypes in published trials. Potential key determinants of responsiveness may include age, trigger, phenotype, tobacco smoke exposure and genotype. The mechanistic pathway for corticoresistance may originate from a gene-environment interaction, leading to non-eosinophilic airway inflammation.

Like many other human and animal viruses, coronavirus infection of mammalian cells induces apoptosis. In this study, the global gene expression profiles are first determined in IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 hours post-infection by Affymetrix array, using avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as a model system. It reveals an up-regulation at the transcriptional level of both pro-apoptotic Bak and pro-survival myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). These results were further confirmed both in vivo and in vitro, in IBV-infected embryonated chicken eggs, chicken fibroblast cells and mammalian cells at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. Interestingly, the onset of apoptosis occurred earlier in IBV-infected mammalian cells silenced with short interfering RNA targeting Mcl-1 (siMcl-1), and was delayed in cells silenced with siBak. IBV progeny production and release were increased in infected Mcl-1 knockdown cells compared to similarly infected control cells, while the contrary was observed in infected Bak knockdown cells. Furthermore, IBV infection-induced up-regulation of GADD153 regulated the expression of Mcl-1. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathways by chemical inhibitors and knockdown of GADD153 by siRNA demonstrated the involvement of ER-stress response in regulation of IBV-induced Mcl-1 expression. These results illustrate the sophisticated regulatory strategies evolved by a coronavirus to modulate both virus-induced apoptosis and viral replication during its replication cycle.","publish_time":"2012-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Yanxin; Liao, Ying; Fang, Shouguo; Tam, James P.; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/693d0f533004851d03a1f38a336f6aa943ea2733.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3256233.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22253918/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Affymetrix","IBV","PI3K/Akt"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV-infected mammalian cells","IBV-infected Vero cells","infected Mcl","infected control cells","infected Bak knockdown cells","IBV infection","regulation of IBV","coronavirus infection of mammalian cells","induced Mcl","chicken fibroblast cells","Virus-induced apoptosis","expression of Mcl","IBV-infected embryonated chicken eggs","IBV progeny production","viral replication","knockdown of GADD153","regulation of GADD153","onset of apoptosis","avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","viral mechanisms","viral pathogenesis","results","understanding virus-host interactions","pro-apoptotic Bak","hours post-infection","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","transcriptional level","replication cycle","global gene expression profiles","pro-survival myeloid cell leukemia","cell death program","key issues","Affymetrix array","mitogen-activated protein","MEK","short interfering RNA","contrary","chemical inhibitors","stress response","animal viruses","Akt","involvement of ER","pathways","siRNA","ERK","release","PI3K","phosphoinositide","study","sophisticated regulatory strategies","translational levels","Inhibition","model system","siMcl","siBak"],"language":"en"},

To impart principles of antimicrobial stewardship (AS) and infection prevention and control (IPC), we developed a curriculum tailored to the diverse aptitudes of learners at our medical center. METHODS. We integrated case-based modules, group learning activities, smartphone applications (apps), decision support tools, and prescription audit and feedback into curricula of the medical school, medicine residency program, infectious diseases (ID) fellowship program, and hospital medicine program operations. Interventions were implemented in 2012\u20132016 using a quasi-experimental before-and-after study design, and this was assessed using pre- and postintervention surveys or audit of antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS. Over 180 medical students participated in the AS and IPC seminars. After smartphone app introduction, 69% reported using the app as their preferred source of antibiotic information. Approximately 70% of students felt comfortable prescribing antibiotics for a known infection compared with 40% at baseline (P = .02), and approximately 83% were able to identify the appropriate personal protective equipment for specific scenarios. Approximately 99% agreed that they have a role in promoting patient safety and preventing healthcare-associated infections as medical students. At 20 months, appropriateness of trainee antibiotic prescriptions increased by 20% (P \u003C .01). Almost all ID fellows indicated that the AS and IPC seminar was a vital training supplement. Uptake of internist antibiotic recommendations using AS decision support tools was approximately 70%. CONCLUSIONS. All 5 interventions addressed learning objectives and knowledge gaps and are applicable across a range of environments.

In this study we sought to uncover the host transcriptional responses underlying differences between high- and low-pathogenic infections. RESULTS: From a compendium of 12 studies that included responses to influenza A subtype H5N1, reconstructed 1918 influenza A virus, and SARS coronavirus, we used meta-analysis to derive multiple gene expression signatures. We compared these signatures by their capacity to segregate biological conditions by pathogenicity and predict pathogenicity in a test data set. The highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples, suggesting a direct, analog relationship between expression and pathogenicity. This signature comprised 57 genes including a subnetwork of chemokines, implicating dysregulated cell recruitment in injury. CONCLUSIONS: Highly pathogenic viruses elicit expression of many of the same key genes as lower pathogenic viruses but to a higher degree. This increased degree of expression may result in the uncontrolled co-localization of inflammatory cell types and lead to irreversible host damage.","publish_time":"2011-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Stewart T; Tchitchek, Nicolas; Ghosh, Debashis; Benecke, Arndt; Katze, Michael G","journal":"BMC Syst Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a12f8004e57cbdc497edada74fdfd8431f4a9eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3297540.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-5-202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22189154/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host transcriptional responses","inappropriate host responses","high-pathogenicity samples","low-pathogenic infections","increased degree of expression","influenza","irreversible host damage","respiratory viral infections host injury","lower pathogenic viruses","multiple gene expression signatures","key genes","higher degree","dysregulated cell recruitment","uncontrolled co-localization of inflammatory cell types","lead","meta-analysis","SARS coronavirus","subnetwork of chemokines","differences","subtype H5N1","analog relationship","biological conditions","capacity","BACKGROUND","test data set","compendium","continuum","studies","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","study"],"language":"en"},

For diagnose of AiV-A from water samples, mostly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system have been developed. However, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has not been applied. In this study, developed a LAMP method to achieve a rapid, specific and highly sensitive detection of AiV-A. The method developed in this study is aimed specifically at AiV-A. Through a specific and non-specific selection and sensitivity test process for the five prepared LAMP primer sets, one primer set and optimum reaction temperature were selected.

It is unknown whether renal patients would represent a distinct group of patients who share some characteristics that could predispose them to have higher infectivity. In this context, we have encountered 4 dialysis patients contracting SARS in a minor outbreak, which involved 11 patients and 4 health care workers, in a medical ward of a regional hospital. Of these 4 dialysis patients, 1 patient was receiving hemodialysis while the other 3 patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Fever and radiological changes were their dominant presenting features. All were having positive results for SARS-associated coronavirus ribonucleic acid by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed on their nasopharyngeal aspirates or stool samples. It appeared that treatment with high-dose intravenous ribavirin and corticosteroids could only resolve the fever, but it could not stop the disease progression. All 4 patients developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on days 9 through 12. At the end, all of the patients died from sudden cardiac arrest, which was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 2 cases. From this small case series, it appeared that dialysis patients might have an aggressive clinical course and poor outcome after contracting SARS. However, a large-scale study is required to further examine this issue, and further investigation into the immunologic abnormalities associated with the uremic state in this group of patients is also warranted.","publish_time":"2003-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Ping-Nam; Mak, Siu-Ka; Lo, Kin-Yee; Tong, Gensy M.W; Wong, Yuk; Watt, Chi-Leung; Wong, Andrew K.M","journal":"American Journal of Kidney Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2b1853aae556beaf9e1bc9d802642fffe35cf68.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115733.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272638603010849; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272638603010849","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["dialysis patients","renal patients","distinct group of patients","SARS-associated coronavirus ribonucleic acid","Fever","continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis","infected renal patient","major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","respiratory failure","minor outbreak","acute myocardial infarction","reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","aggressive clinical course","medical ward","nasopharyngeal aspirates","Hong Kong","high-dose intravenous ribavirin","radiological changes","corticosteroids","poor outcome","private housing estate","uremic state","mechanical ventilation","health care workers","positive results","dominant presenting features","immunologic abnormalities","treatment","days","sudden cardiac arrest","investigation","regional hospital","stool samples","cases","small case series","hemodialysis","Abstract","characteristics","primary source","higher infectivity","disease progression","large-scale study","issue","context","end"],"language":"en"},

We isolated virus from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens, and characterized the viral sequence, replication properties, and cell culture tropism. We found that the virus replicates to high titer in Vero-CCL81 cells and Vero E6 cells in the absence of trypsin. We also deposited the virus into two virus repositories, making it broadly available to the public health and research communities.

The pregnant sows were immunized once (42\u201349 days before farrowing) or twice (42\u201349 and 7\u201315 days before farrowing) by the oral, intramuscular or conjunctival route with the 188-SG strain. Sows exposed to virulent TGEV in the field and experimentally infected sows (two oral inoculations during pregnancy) were used as positive controls leading to high protection. The neutralizing antibody response to vaccination and/or infection was studied in serum and milk. No protection against mortality was observed in the litters of (1) the nine seronegative, susceptible sows, with piglet mortality of 65/70, (2) the seven once orally vaccinated sows, with mortality of 44/54, (3) the seven sows vaccinated twice by the conjunctival route, with mortality of 55/76.

The children were all aged three years or less. In each case death was preceded by an unexpected increase in ventilatory pressure requirement followed by the development of a similar pulmonary shadowing on chest radiography. The radiological abnormality was felt to be consistent with a pneumonitis associated with some small airway disease. The clustering of these deaths, occurring in a similar unusual manner, was felt to constitute an outbreak warranting investigation. An Incident Committee was established to plan and manage a large multidisciplinary investigation during which the unit was temporarily closed. Following extensive investigation no bacterium, virus, fungus or other pathogen, toxic agent, or any other explanation for the cluster of deaths could be found. The possibility that the cluster occurred by chance remains although this was felt to be unlikely.","publish_time":"1993-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maguire, H.; Watson, J.; George, R.; Taylor, L.; Murray, V.; Penny, D.; Rigby, M.; Taylor, P.; Gaya, H.; Durman, L.","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0195670193900717; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0195670193900717","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cluster of deaths","children","unexplained deaths","extensive investigation","large multidisciplinary investigation","congenital heart disease","similar pulmonary shadowing","small airway disease","similar unusual manner","paediatric intensive care unit","PICU","development","fungus","unexpected increase","ventilatory pressure requirement","virus","toxic agent","pathogen","pneumonitis","chest radiography","cardiac surgical procedures","bacterium","explanation","case death","radiological abnormality","Abstract","years","possibility","chance","Incident Committee","outbreak","clustering"],"language":"en"},

Pigs with PMWS are often infected with a variety of other pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and mycoplasm, in addition to porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). PCV2 and Haemophilus parasuis serovar 4 (HPS4) coinfection remain epidemic in China. METHODS: Here we report construction of a three-week-old naturally farrowed, colostrum-deprived (NFCD) piglet\u2019s infection model and demonstrate that PCV2-infected piglets with the HPS4 coinfection increased the virulence of PCV2 and these pathogens interact acquired PMWS. RESULTS: All the single infected piglets were transiently bacteremic or viremic. All the PCV2/HPS4 coinfected piglets developed PMWS, characterized by dyspnea, anorexia, prostration and lose weight severely. Co-infection with PCV2 and HPS4 resulted in an increased amount of virus in serum and tissues, presented a slower generation and lower levels of antibodies against PCV2. Co-infection with PCV2 and HPS4 resulted in further reductions in total and differential peripheral blood leukocyte counts. Meantime, PCV2/ HPS4 coinfection potentiated the severity of lung and lymphoid lesions by PCV2-associated, increased the virulence of PCV2-antigen and enhanced the incidence of PMWS in piglets. CONCLUSION: Co-infection with PCV2 and HPS4 induce the exacerbation of system injuries and enhance the pathogenicity of PCV2 in piglets.","publish_time":"2017-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Shuqing; Li, Wentao; Wang, Yang; Gu, Changqin; Liu, Xiaoli; Charreyre, Catherine; Fan, Shenxian; He, Qigai","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c492e76efc05b17e67a3e09c7e3ac44cca89e29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5696968.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29157279/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0890-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMWS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["virulence of PCV2","pathogenicity of PCV2","PCV2-infected piglets","HPS4 coinfection","HPS4 coinfected piglets","Co-infection","incidence of PMWS","single infected piglets","piglet\u2019s infection model","pathogens","reductions","severity of lung","differential peripheral blood leukocyte counts","slower generation","mycoplasm","addition","syndrome","lower levels of antibodies","porcine circovirus type","Haemophilus parasuis serovar","exacerbation of system injuries","colostrum","tissues","bacteria","viruses","serum","NFCD","anorexia","Postweaning multisystemic","lymphoid lesions","bacteremic","dyspnea","antigen","emerging disease","prostration","BACKGROUND","variety","RESULTS","viremic","China","CONCLUSION","week-old","construction","weight","swine","METHODS","Pigs"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to develop a practical framework for the ethical evaluation of PH programs. Study design A multidisciplinary team developed an ethical framework to evaluate PH plans from 2015 to 2017. Methods In this study, the multi-method approach was used. First, a list of moral norms in PH policy and practice was drafted and completed in two interactive sessions. Then, the Delphi method was used for consensus about the structural components to be adopted in the framework. After developing the framework, its efficiency was assessed by evaluating Iran\u0027s Fourth Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. Results The framework was developed in the following three sections: (i) determination of the general moral norms in PH practice and policy; (ii) five steps of evaluation; and (iii) a procedural evaluation step to ensure fair decision-making. The ratio of the ethical points of the PH plan increased by 46% after implementation of the framework, and the frequency of ethical points increased significantly after applying the framework (P = 0.001).

We hypothesized that structural changes of the lung might correlate with symptoms and pulmonary function. To answer this question, we correlate findings of high-resolution CT (HRCT) with dyspnea scores and results of pulmonary function tests in patients during recovery from SARS. Design: Retrospective follow-up cohort study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: Nineteen patients who recovered from SARS-related hospitalization. Measurements: The study included HRCT scores (0 to 100), dyspnea scores (1 to 4), static and dynamic lung volumes, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco). Results: The interval between hospital discharge and HRCT study or functional assessment was 31.2 \u00B1 4.8 days (range, 25 to 38 days) [mean \u00B1 SD]. All patients had HRCT abnormalities and were assigned to two groups: ground-glass opacity (GGO) only (n = 7, 36.8%) and GGO with fibrosis (GGO\u002BF) [n = 12, 63.2%]. Most patients (16 of 19, 84.2%) had no zonal predominance. HRCT scores correlated well with dyspnea scores (r = 0.78, p \u003C 0.01) and with a variety of pulmonary functional variables, with Dlco being the most significant (r = \u2212 0.923, p \u003C 0.001). Compared with the GGO group, the GGO\u002BF group showed significantly lower FEV1, FVC, total lung capacity, residual volume, and Dlco. Conclusions: HRCT findings correlate well with functional studies and clinical symptoms during recovery from SARS. Longer-term follow-up studies in a larger cohort of patients should be performed to investigate the clinical outcome of recovered SARS patients.","publish_time":"2004-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsu, Hsian-He; Tzao, Ching; Wu, Chin-Pyng; Chang, Wei-Chou; Tsai, Chen-Liang; Tung, Ho-Jui; Chen, Cheng-Yu","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b2b2560c7372956ac851ab78c8a72cc5dde24d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094423.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215329081; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215329081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University","HRCT","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRCT scores","HRCT study","HRCT findings","dyspnea scores","GGO group","HRCT abnormalities","clinical outcome of recovered SARS patients","larger cohort of patients","Dlco","functional studies","Study objectives","total lung capacity","SARS-related hospitalization","Retrospective follow-up cohort study","recovery period","dynamic lung volumes","functional assessment","F group","results of pulmonary function tests","variety of pulmonary functional variables","clinical symptoms","days","Longer-term follow-up studies","diffusing capacity","hospital discharge","University hospital","findings of high-resolution CT","severe acute respiratory syndrome","FVC","lower FEV1","residual volume","interval","carbon monoxide","ground-glass opacity","groups","infection","Design","nature","fibrosis","Measurements","mean","SD","Setting","question","structural changes","range","Conclusions","zonal predominance"],"language":"en"},

This review, analyzing the main clinical studies, aims at being a state of the art update of the use of probiotic formulations in daily practice. METHODS: In this review we include all the most significant clinical trials involving the use of probiotic formulations for the treatment of several pathologies. RESULTS: Dysbiosis has been observed in irritable bowel syndrome patients. Probiotics may exert a beneficial effect on Crohn\u2019s disease affected patients who have shown gut microbiota antigens and altered wall permeability. Moreover some probiotic formulations seem to enhance the therapy for Helycobacter Pylori reducing its pathogenic potential. Intestinal ecology imbalance has been also linked to cancer induction, allergy, skin and urogenital diseases. In addition probiotics administration seems to be particularly useful to ease post-operative complications. CONCLUSION: Further future clinical trials, involving large numbers of patients, will be mandatory to achieve definite evidence of the preventive and curative role of probiotics in medical practice.","publish_time":"2010-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iannitti, T.; Palmieri, B.","journal":"Clin Nutr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/089fe4ccb73c58ce9e56a931d64f5378465c92a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172412.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261561410000907; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2010.05.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561410000907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20576332/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND","Probiotics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of probiotic formulations","future clinical trials","significant clinical trials","review","AIMS","large numbers of patients","curative role of probiotics","main clinical studies","addition probiotics administration","irritable bowel syndrome patients","medical practice","daily practice","urogenital diseases","spreading of gastrointestinal diseases","gut microbiota antigens","altered wall permeability","allergy","skin","preventive","therapy","beneficial effect","definite evidence","Crohn\u2019s disease","art update","palliation","partial knowledge","Helycobacter Pylori","cancer induction","treatment","pathogenic potential","Dysbiosis","aethiology","pathogenesis","post-operative complications","state","CONCLUSION","effective therapeutic approach","Intestinal ecology imbalance","cure","BACKGROUND","pathologies","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN Cross-sectional survey focused on various elements of respiratory disease preparedness. SETTING Critical access hospital (CAHs) and acute care hospitals (ACHs) in Idaho. METHODS The electronic survey was sent to infection preventionists (IPs) and nurse administrators in 44 hospitals in Idaho. RESULTS In all, 32 (73%) hospitals responded to the survey. Participating facilities reported their preparedness with respect to existing, formalized structures for managing infectious disease incidents-specifically COVID-19-as well as availability of resources, such as isolation rooms and personal protective equipment, for safely managing suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS Hospitals covered by the survey have varying levels of preparedness for managing COVID-19 cases, with differences across the various categories of interest in this study.

In this study, there was a difference in MT content between two rice varieties that correlated with one being susceptible and one being resistant to RSV, which suggested that MT is related to RSV resistance. In addition, a test with two NO biosynthesis inhibitors revealed that NO inhibitor were able to increase the disease incidence of RSV. A pharmacological experiment with exogenous MT and NO showed that increased MT and NO in the MT-pretreated plants led to lower disease incidences; however, only NO increased in a NO-releasing reagent [sodium nitroprusside (SNP)] pretreated plants. The expressions level of OsPR1b and OsWRKY 45 were significantly induced by MT and NO.

No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment. In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed.

Microglia, the resident inflammatory cells of the brain, are important for pathogen detection and initiation of innate immunity, however, a novel role for these cells as immune regulators has also emerged. PD-L1 on microglia has been shown to negatively regulate T-cell activation in models of multiple sclerosis and acute viral encephalitis. In this study, we investigated the role of glial cell PD-L1 in controlling encephalitogenic CD8(\u002B) T-lymphocytes, which infiltrate the brain to manage viral infection, but remain to produce chronic neuroinflammation. Using a model of chronic neuroinflammation following murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-induced encephalitis, we found that CD8(\u002B) T-cells persisting within the brain expressed PD-1. Conversely, activated microglia expressed PD-L1. In vitro, primary murine microglia, which express low basal levels of PD-L1, upregulated the co-inhibitory ligand upon IFN-\u03B3-treatment. Blockade of the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway in microglial: CD8(\u002B) T-cell co-cultures increased T-cell IFN-\u03B3 and interleukin (IL)-2 production. We observed a similar phenomenon following blockade of this co-inhibitory pathway in astrocyte: CD8(\u002B) T-cell co-cultures. Using ex vivo cultures of brain leukocytes, including microglia and CD8(\u002B) T-cells, obtained from mice with MCMV-induced chronic neuroinflammation, we found that neutralization of either PD-1 or PD-L1 increased IFN-\u03B3 production from virus-specific CD8(\u002B) T-cells stimulated with MCMV IE1(168-176) peptide. These data demonstrate that microglia and astrocytes control antiviral T-cell responses and suggest a therapeutic potential of PD1: PD-L1 modulation to manage the deleterious consequences of uncontrolled neuroinflammation.","publish_time":"2014-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schachtele, Scott J.; Hu, Shuxian; Sheng, Wen S.; Mutnal, Manohar B.; Lokensgard, James R.","journal":"Glia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5875cc3e331e8883aeb794a9c9c0e6d479d6cec9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7970ffdbf4b53860197f4315dde20b01a2c19a5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4141010.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24890099/; https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.22701; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4141010?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T-cells","PD-L1 pathway","PD-L1 modulation","role of glial cell PD-L1","T-cell co-cultures","T-cell activation","T-cell IFN-\u03B3","PD-L1 increased IFN-\u03B3 production","antiviral T-cell responses","activated cells","suppression of activated T-lymphocytes","low basal levels of PD","encephalitogenic CD8","primary murine microglia","virus-specific CD8","cultures of brain leukocytes","co-inhibitory pathway","resident inflammatory cells","model of chronic neuroinflammation","inhibitory ligand","MCMV IE1","induced encephalitis","Blockade","deleterious consequences of uncontrolled neuroinflammation","acute viral encephalitis","murine cytomegalovirus","novel role","viral infection","models of multiple sclerosis","pathogen detection","astrocytes","initiation of innate immunity","therapeutic potential of PD1","interleukin","receptor","mechanism","mice","programmed death","similar phenomenon","immune regulators","Engagement","ex","treatment","neutralization","data","peptide","study"],"language":"en"},

We have isolated cl-2-derived variant viruses resistant to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the spike (S) protein of cl-2. The variants MM6 and MM13, selected by the MAbs specific for the JHMV S protein, were revealed to have a point mutation located within the N-terminal 100 amino acids (aa) of the S1 protein. The variants MM56, MM85, and MM78, selected by MAbs specific for the larger S protein of JHMV, were shown to have a deletion composed of about 150 aa located in the middle of the S1 subunit (MM56 and MM85) or one amino acid deletion, aspattic acid at number 543 from the N-terminus of the S1 (MM78). These five MAb-resistant variants were not different from cl-2 in growth pattern on cultured DBT cells. MM6 and MM13 were shown to be highly neurovirulent for 4-week-old Lewis rats, growing to high titers in the brain and causing as high an incidence of neurological disease and death as the parental cl-2. In contrast, MM56 and MM85 were nonneurovirulent for rats. They did not cause any central nervous system disorders nor did they multiply in the rat brains. MM78 showed intermediate neurovirulence as well as intermediate growth potential in the rat brain. However, there was no apparent difference in neurovirulence between the parental and the MAb-resistant variants for mice; all of these viruses showed high neurovirulence for mice. These results suggest that the domain composed of about 150 aa in the middle of the S1 is critical for high neurovirulence of JHMV for rats. Furthermore, it is suggested that the neurovirulence of cl-2 for mice is controlled by a different viral factor.","publish_time":"1995-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taguchi, Fumihiro; Kubo, Hideyuki; Takahashi, Hiromi; Suzuki, Hideka","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682285711300; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285711300","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["JHMV","JHMV S","DBT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JHMV variants","high neurovirulence of JHMV","JHMV S protein","S1 protein","variants MM56","intermediate neurovirulence","variants MM6","MAb-resistant variants","larger S protein of JHMV","MAbs specific","MM85","mice","MM78","high titers","S1 subunit","amino acid deletion","week-old Lewis rats","middle","MM13","cloned virus of murine coronavirus JHMV","derived variant viruses resistant","intermediate growth potential","aspattic acid","growth pattern","amino acids","N-terminal","N-terminus","rat brains","different viral factor","neutralization","monoclonal antibodies","number","incidence of neurological disease","cultured DBT cells","death","nonneurovirulent","spike","comparison","central nervous system disorders","contrast","apparent difference","point mutation","domain","results"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to identify the incidence of hyponatraemia in cases of CAP, to find predictive tools in order to classify the severity and outcome of CAP and to explore possible differences of clinical importance between the two sexes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical files of 54 children (66.4% males), 4.67 \u00B12.88 years old, were retro-prospectively reviewed. RESULTS: 35/54 (64.8%) children with pneumonia had normal values of sodium at admission, 18/54 (33.3%) had mild hyponatraemia and 1 child (1.9%) moderate hyponatraemia. Increased heart rhythm and tachypnoea at admission were correlated with lower values of sodium (z= \u22122.664, p = 0.007 and z = \u22121.705, p = 0.089 respectively). No differences were found between the two sexes concerning the characteristics of pneumonia or the range of sodium in serum at admission. A correlation was found between sodium admission values and: a) C-reactive protein (p = 0.000), and b) leukocyte count (p = 0.006). Sedimentation rate (p = 0.021) was also considered as a possible risk factor affecting the value of sodium at admission to hospital. Finally, a negative association was also observed between the degree of hyponatraemia and the duration of hospitalization (z = \u22123.398, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although studies in larger population groups are needed, in our study increased heart rhythm, tachypnoea, leucocyte count, C-reactive protein, and also erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be considered as possible risk factors influencing the degree of hyponatraemia, and thus the outcome of hospitalized children with CAP.","publish_time":"2010-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sakellaropoulou, Afroditi; Hatzistilianou, Maria; Eboriadou, Maria; Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou, Fanni","journal":"Arch Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51485c1b5e3ce7050422a81c6a16ed00faa768fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3284074.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2010.14471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22371803/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sodium admission values","degree of hyponatraemia","incidence of hyponatraemia","mild hyponatraemia","moderate hyponatraemia","value of sodium","lower values of sodium","normal values of sodium","range of sodium","outcome of CAP","outcome of hospitalized children","tachypnoea","C-reactive protein","possible risk factors","possible differences of clinical importance","cases of CAP","Increased heart rhythm","characteristics of pneumonia","study","sexes","erythrocyte sedimentation rate","leucocyte count","clinical practice","common laboratory","leukocyte count","common electrolyte imbalance","community","studies","larger population groups","order","predictive tools","medical files","severity","duration of hospitalization","CONCLUSIONS","MATERIAL","METHODS","serum","correlation","years old","males","INTRODUCTION","negative association","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Overall, 57% of patients were seropositive for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1; of these, 50% were classified as World Health Organization Aids stage IV. The prevalence of enteric viruses in stool specimens did not differ significantly between patients with and without HIV infection, and was not associated with acute or chronic diarrhoea, or constitutional symptoms. However, a trend (P = 0\u00B714) towards greater frequency of virus in stools from patients in the lower 3 quintiles of the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio was seen.

An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS For this ESTRO \u0026 ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to the consensus process using a modified Delphi process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, the early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of our radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided. CONCLUSION This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guckenberger, Matthias; Belka, Claus; Bezjak, Andrea; Bradley, Jeffrey; Daly, Megan E; DeRuysscher, Dirk; Dziadziuszko, Rafal; Faivre-Finn, Corinne; Flentje, Michael; Gore, Elizabeth; Higgins, Kristin A; Iyengar, Puneeth; Kavanagh, Brian D; Kumar, Sameera; Le Pechoux, Cecile; Lievens, Yolande; Lindberg, Karin; McDonald, Fiona; Ramella, Sara; Rengan, Ramesh; Ricardi, Umberto; Rimner, Andreas; Rodrigues, George B; Schild, Steven E; Senan, Suresh; Simone Ii, Charles B; Slotman, Ben J; Stuschke, Martin; Videtic, Greg; Widder, Joachim; Yom, Sue S; Palma, David","journal":"Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342863/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ESTRO \u0026 ASTRO","SCLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung cancer radiotherapy","radiotherapy staff","postoperative radiotherapy","fractionation of radiotherapy","reduced radiotherapy resources","palliative thoracic radiotherapy","potential adaptations of radiotherapy","prognosis of lung cancer patients","interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID","radiotherapy resource pressures","exposure of cancer patients","pandemic scenarios","common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy","guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice","common lung cancer cases","severe pandemic scenario","risk-mitigation pandemic scenario","altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy","later pandemic scenario","increased risk of COVID","early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation","severe COVID","positive patients","consensus process","advanced NSCLC","balanced consensus recommendations","resection of pN2 NSCLC","increased risks","increased susceptibility","joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation","stage","healthcare staff","infection","reduced resources","Case-specific consensus recommendations","multimodality treatment strategies","relative benefit of radiation","international group of experts","modified Delphi process","prophylactic cranial irradiation","life expectancy","cure","triage","project","important factors","CONCLUSION","minimization of patient","postponement","efforts","challenges","order","performance status","RESULTS","METHODS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The number of affected population is on rising, so is the mortality. This crisis has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructures in many affected countries. Due to overall rising cancer incidence and specific concerns, a cohort of cancer patients forms a distinct subset of the population in whom a correct and timely treatment has a huge impact on the outcome. During this period, oncology care is definitely affected owing to many factors like lockdowns, reduced beds and deferral of elective cases to halt the spread of the pandemic. Surgery remains the best line of defence in many solid organ tumours especially in early stage and is potentially curative. China, the source of this pandemic, has taken more than 3 months to enter the post transitional phase of this pandemic. Deferring cancer surgeries for this long period may have a direct impact on the long-term outcomes of cancer patients. Many surgical oncology associations across the globe have come up with triage guidelines for surgical care of cancer patients; however, these are based on expert opinion rather than actual data. Herein, we intend to review these guidelines with respect to the risk of disease progression in cancer patients. In the absence of actual data on cancer surgery care during this pandemic, clinical decisions should be based on careful consideration of disease-related and patient-related factors. While some of the cancer surgeries can be safely delayed for some time, how long we can delay surgeries safely cannot be answered/ explained by any means. Thorough evaluation and discussion by an expert and experienced multidisciplinary team appears to be the most effective way forward.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shinde, Rajesh S.; Naik, Mekhala D.; Shinde, Shital R.; Bhandare, Manish S.; Chaudhari, Vikram A.; Shrikhande, Shailesh V.; Dcruz, Anil K.","journal":"Indian J Surg Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b99d1e87397107eea595f0d466ddd531c30cec99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7212248.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13193-020-01086-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395064/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["pandemic","cancer surgery care","cohort of cancer patients","surgical care of cancer patients","Deferring cancer surgeries","long-term outcomes of cancer patients","overall rising cancer incidence","oncology care","affected countries","long period","number of affected population","patient-related factors","absence of actual data","surgical oncology associations","huge impact","direct impact","triage guidelines","expert opinion","risk of disease progression","careful consideration of disease","specific concerns","solid organ tumours","reduced beds","early stage","deferral of elective cases","discussion","lockdowns","best line of defence","globe","clinical decisions","timely treatment","distinct subset","experienced multidisciplinary team","post transitional phase","respect","healthcare infrastructures","owing","global health emergency","months","Thorough evaluation","spread","crisis","China","source","effective way","COVID","mortality","means"],"language":"en"},

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection has become an important endemic disease in Southeast Asia and China. We have previously shown that oxidative stress promotes viral replication, and progeny virus induces oxidative stress in host cells. The detailed mechanism for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in infected cells remains elusive. In the current study, we demonstrate that mitochondria were a major ROS source in EV71-infected cells. Mitochondria in productively infected cells underwent morphologic changes and exhibited functional anomalies, such as a decrease in mitochondrial electrochemical potential \u0394\u03A8(m) and an increase in oligomycin-insensitive oxygen consumption. Respiratory control ratio of mitochondria from infected cells was significantly lower than that of normal cells. The total adenine nucleotide pool and ATP content of EV71-infected cells significantly diminished. However, there appeared to be a compensatory increase in mitochondrial mass. Treatment with mito-TEMPO reduced eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation and viral replication, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS act to promote viral replication. It is plausible that EV71 infection induces mitochondrial ROS generation, which is essential to viral replication, at the sacrifice of efficient energy production, and that infected cells up-regulate biogenesis of mitochondria to compensate for their functional defect.","publish_time":"2014-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Mei-Ling; Weng, Shiue-Fen; Kuo, Chih-Hao; Ho, Hung-Yao","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ac54db3298b52d9d78f4255e40447904bd90ad7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4234665.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25401329/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113234","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP"],"locations":["Southeast Asia","China"],"keyphrases":["EV71-infected cells","host cells","normal cells","viral replication","mitochondrial ROS generation","mitochondrial ROS act","EV71 infection","mitochondrial mass","biogenesis of mitochondria","major ROS source","ATP content of EV71","oxidative stress","mitochondrial electrochemical potential \u0394\u03A8","Respiratory control ratio of mitochondria","important host factor","important endemic disease","functional anomalies","compensatory increase","functional defect","reactive oxygen species","outcome of infectious disease","oligomycin-insensitive oxygen consumption","progeny virus","mito-TEMPO reduced eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","decrease","total adenine nucleotide pool","morphologic changes","Southeast Asia","sacrifice of efficient energy production","detailed mechanism","Treatment","China","Redox homeostasis","current study","Enterovirus"],"language":"en"},

It is also the site for quality control of misfolded proteins and entry point of extracellular proteins to the secretory pathway. Hence at any given point of time, endoplasmic reticulum contains two different cohorts of proteins, (i) proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum-specific function, which reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, called as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins and (ii) proteins which are in process of moving to the extracellular space. Thus, endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins must somehow be distinguished from newly synthesized secretory proteins, which pass through the endoplasmic reticulum on their way out of the cell. Approximately only 50% of the proteins used in this study as training data had endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, which shows that these signals are not essentially present in all endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. This also strongly indicates the role of additional factors in retention of endoplasmic reticulum-specific proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum. METHODS: This is a support vector machine based method, where we had used different forms of protein features as inputs for support vector machine to develop the prediction models. During training leave-one-out approach of cross-validation was used. Maximum performance was obtained with a combination of amino acid compositions of different part of proteins. RESULTS: In this study, we have reported a novel support vector machine based method for predicting endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins, named as ERPred. During training we achieved a maximum accuracy of 81.42% with leave-one-out approach of cross-validation. When evaluated on independent dataset, ERPred did prediction with sensitivity of 72.31% and specificity of 83.69%. We have also annotated six different proteomes to predict the candidate endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins in them. A webserver, ERPred, was developed to make the method available to the scientific community, which can be accessed at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/erpred/index.html. DISCUSSION: We found that out of 124 proteins of the training dataset, only 66 proteins had endoplasmic reticulum retention signals, which shows that these signals are not an absolute necessity for endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins to remain inside the endoplasmic reticulum. This observation also strongly indicates the role of additional factors in retention of proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum. Our proposed predictor, ERPred, is a signal independent tool. It is tuned for the prediction of endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins, even if the query protein does not contain specific ER-retention signal.","publish_time":"2017-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Ravindra; Kumari, Bandana; Kumar, Manish","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/465fdc27c98bca041c61f4c5d85671ec92a3b53d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5588793.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28890846/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3561","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prediction of endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins","retention of endoplasmic reticulum-specific proteins","candidate endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins","retention of proteins","endoplasmic reticulum retention signals","synthesized proteins","endoplasmic reticulum-specific function","different cohorts of proteins","synthesized secretory proteins","entry point of extracellular proteins","quality control of misfolded proteins","ERPred","specific ER-retention signal","training dataset","training leave","novel support vector machine","different proteomes","role of additional factors","different forms of protein features","protein synthesis","query protein","method available","important role","prediction models","signal independent tool","study","independent dataset","approach of cross","validation","combination of amino acid compositions of different","extracellular space","secretory pathway","maximum accuracy","Maximum performance","given point of time","inputs","post-translational processing","absolute necessity","cellular processes","site","sensitivity","scientific community","lumen","proposed predictor","METHODS","BACKGROUND","specificity","RESULTS","observation","webserver","DISCUSSION"],"language":"en"},

In this study, through bioactivity guided fractionation of the crude extract, the data demonstrate that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl-\u03B2-D-glucose (PGG) was a primary constituent responsible for hLDH-A inhibition, present at ~9.95 \u00B1 0.34% dry weight. Theoretical molecular docking studies of hLDH-A indicate that PGG acts through competitive binding at the NADH cofactor site, effects confirmed by functional enzyme studies where the IC(50) = 27.32 nM was reversed with increasing concentration of NADH. Moreover, we confirm protein expression of hLDH-A in MDA-231 human breast carcinoma cells and show that PGG was toxic (LC(50) = 94.18 \u00B5M), parallel to attenuated lactic acid production (IC(50) = 97.81 \u00B5M).

We did a systematic review of articles published between 1990 and 2011 reporting at least one of 13 pathogens in children \u003C5 years of age hospitalized with diarrhea. We included 2011 rotavirus data from the Rotavirus Surveillance Network coordinated by WHO. We excluded studies conducted during diarrhea outbreaks that did not discriminate between inpatient and outpatient cases, reporting nosocomial infections, those conducted in special populations, not done with adequate methods, and rotavirus studies in countries where the rotavirus vaccine was used. Age-adjusted median proportions for each pathogen were calculated and applied to 712 000 deaths due to diarrhea in children under 5 years for 2011, assuming that those observed among children hospitalized for diarrhea represent those causing child diarrhea deaths. 163 articles and WHO studies done in 31 countries were selected representing 286 inpatient studies. Studies seeking only one pathogen found higher proportions for some pathogens than studies seeking multiple pathogens (e.g. 39% rotavirus in 180 single-pathogen studies vs. 20% in 24 studies with 5\u201313 pathogens, p\u003C0\u00B70001). The percentage of episodes for which no pathogen could be identified was estimated to be 34%; the total of all age-adjusted percentages for pathogens and no-pathogen cases was 138%.

Numerous antiviral targets and small molecule inhibitors that have efficacy in cell culture have now been identified; however, further studies in this area are required in order to make these suitable for clinical use.","publish_time":"2013-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arias, Armando; Emmott, Edward; Vashist, Surender; Goodfellow, Ian","journal":"Future Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07e425b0a2cb18dc7e27723172b276c1c1c4487a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3904215.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2217/fmb.13.109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24199805/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute infection","antiviral therapy","vaccine candidate","area","years","licensed vaccine","Numerous antiviral targets","immunocompromised patients","developed world","cohort of patients","control infection","Recent work","major cause of acute gastroenteritis","small molecule inhibitors","efficacy","population","long-term infections","example","infectious material","ability","care workers","cell culture","order","trials","development","clinical use","Noroviruses","studies"],"language":"en"},

Objectives This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of children with HMPV infection admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) across the United Kingdom (UK) over a nine-year period and to estimate the associated costs of care. Study design Data were collected from the UK paediatric intensive care audit network (PICANet) and costs calculated using the National Health Service (NHS) reference costing scheme. Results There were 114 admissions in which HMPV was detected. The number of admissions associated with a code of HMPV rose steadily over the study period (three in 2006 to 28 in 2014) and showed significant seasonal variability, with the peak season being from November to May. Children required varying levels of intensive care support from minimal to complex support including invasive ventilation, inotropes, renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). HMPV was associated with five deaths during the study period. The associated costs of PICU admissions were estimated to be between \u00A32,256,823 and \u00A33,997,823 over the study period, with estimated annual costs rising over the study period due to increasing HMPV admissions.

In this study, we generated a VV-based CPV2 vaccine candidate (VV-CPV-VP2) and then evaluated its immunogenicity in mice and dogs. The exogenous vp2 gene of CPV2, which replaced the major virulence gene hemagglutinin (ha) of VV, expressed efficiently and stably in vitro. Subsequently, intramuscular immunization of mice induced robust and lasting systemic immune responses, including neutralizing antibody against both CPV2a and CPV2b, and CPV2-VP2-specific interferon gamma (IFN-\u03B3) secreting T cell. In addition, administration with a high-dose of VV-CPV-VP2 did not cause significant side effects for mice, thus indicating marked safety of this vaccine candidate. Most importantly, a single-dose vaccination of VV-CPV2-VP2 elicited substantial antibody responses and provided comparable protection for dogs with attenuated CPV2 vaccine.

Recently, the age-related changes in several inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. The purposes of this systematic review were two-fold: (1) to describe the patterns of muscle strength loss with age in the general population, and (2) to quantify the loss of muscle strength in rheumatoid arthritis as representative for an underlying inflammatory state. Handgrip strength was used as a proxy for overall muscle strength. RESULTS: Results from 114 studies (involving 90,520 subjects) and 71 studies (involving 10,529 subjects) were combined in a meta-analysis for the general and rheumatoid arthritis population respectively and standardized at an equal sex distribution. For the general population we showed that between the ages of 25 years and 95 years mean handgrip strength declined from 45.5 kg to 23.2 kg for males and from 27.1 kg to 12.8 kg for females. We noted a steeper handgrip strength decline after 50 years of age (rate of 0.37 kg/year). In the rheumatoid arthritis population handgrip strength was not associated with chronological age between the ages of 35 years and 65 years and was as low as 20.2 kg in male and 15.1 in female. Rheumatoid arthritis disease duration was inversely associated with handgrip strength. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows distinct patterns of age-related decrease of handgrip strength in the general population. Handgrip strength is strongly associated with the presence and duration of an inflammatory state as rheumatoid arthritis. The putative link between age-related inflammation and sarcopenia mandates further study as it represents a potential target for intervention to maintain functional independence in old age.","publish_time":"2010-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beenakker, Karel G.M.; Ling, Carolina H.; Meskers, Carel G.M.; de Craen, Anton J.M.; Stijnen, Theo; Westendorp, Rudi G.J.; Maier, Andrea B.","journal":"Ageing Res Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee197c18999212ede96283c636088ae1ee232ea1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105185.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20553969/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2010.05.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568163710000486; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163710000486","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rheumatoid arthritis population handgrip strength","loss of muscle strength","years of age","steeper handgrip strength decline","overall muscle strength","general population","patterns of muscle strength loss","distinct patterns of age-related decrease of handgrip strength","old age","Rheumatoid arthritis disease duration","chronological age","age-related inflammation","age-related changes","meta-analysis","sarcopenia mandates","underlying inflammatory state","inflammatory mediators","pathogenesis of sarcopenia","ages","studies","RESULTS","subjects","serious consequences of sarcopenia","representative","study","functionality","functional independence","intervention","proxy","potential target","putative link","recognition","autonomy","presence","systematic review","CONCLUSIONS","rate","equal sex distribution","purposes","fold","BACKGROUND","females"],"language":"en"},

The extent to which the fitness costs of infection are mediated by key life\u2010history traits such as age or social status is still unclear. Within populations, individual heterogeneity in the outcome of infection is the result of two successive processes; the degree of contact with the pathogen (exposure) and the immune response to infection. In social mammals, because individuals holding high social status typically interact more frequently with group members, they should be more often in contact with infected individuals than those of low social status. However, when access to resources is determined by social status, individuals with a high social status are often better nourished, have a greater opportunity to allocate resources to immune processes and therefore should have a smaller chance of succumbing to infection than individuals with low social status. 2. We investigated the risk and fitness costs of infection during a virulent epidemic of canine distemper virus (CDV) in a social carnivore, the spotted hyena, in the Serengeti National Park. We analysed two decades of detailed life\u2010history data from 625 females and 816 males using a multi\u2010event capture\u2013mark\u2013recapture model that accounts for uncertainty in the assignment of individual infection states. 3. Cubs of mothers with a high social status had a lower probability of CDV infection and were more likely to survive infection than those with low social status. Subadult and adult females with high social status had a higher infection probability than those with low social status. Subadult females and pre\u2010breeder males that had recovered from CDV infection had a lower survival than susceptible ones. 4. Our study disentangles the relative importance of individual exposure and resource allocation to immune processes, demonstrates fitness costs of infection for juveniles, particularly for those with low social status, shows that patterns of infection can be driven by different mechanisms among juveniles and adults and establishes a negative relationship between infection and fitness in a free\u2010ranging mammal.

The association between host immune responses and clinical outcome in severe cases is unknown. METHODS: We utilized gene expression, cytokine profiles and generation of antibody responses following hospitalization in 19 critically ill patients with primary pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza pneumonia for identifying host immune responses associated with clinical outcome. Ingenuity pathway analysis 8.5 (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) was used to select, annotate and visualize genes by function and pathway (gene ontology). IPA analysis identified those canonical pathways differentially expressed (P \u003C 0.05) between comparison groups. Hierarchical clustering of those genes differentially expressed between groups by IPA analysis was performed using BRB-Array Tools v.3.8.1. RESULTS: The majority of patients were characterized by the presence of comorbidities and the absence of immunosuppressive conditions. pH1N1 specific antibody production was observed around day 9 from disease onset and defined an early period of innate immune response and a late period of adaptive immune response to the virus. The most severe patients (n = 12) showed persistence of viral secretion. Seven of the most severe patients died. During the late phase, the most severe patient group had impaired expression of a number of genes participating in adaptive immune responses when compared to less severe patients. These genes were involved in antigen presentation, B-cell development, T-helper cell differentiation, CD28, granzyme B signaling, apoptosis and protein ubiquitination. Patients with the poorest outcomes were characterized by proinflammatory hypercytokinemia, along with elevated levels of immunosuppressory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-1ra) in serum. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest an impaired development of adaptive immunity in the most severe cases of pandemic influenza, leading to an unremitting cycle of viral replication and innate cytokine-chemokine release. Interruption of this deleterious cycle may improve disease outcome.","publish_time":"2010-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Rello, Jordi; Ant\u00F3n, Andres; Almansa, Raquel; Xu, Luoling; Lopez-Campos, Guillermo; Pumarola, Tom\u00E1s; Ran, Longsi; Ramirez, Paula; Banner, David; Cheuk Ng, Derek; Socias, Lorenzo; Loza, Ana; Andaluz, David; Maravi, Enrique; G\u00F3mez-S\u00E1nchez, Maria J; Gord\u00F3n, M\u00F3nica; Gallegos, Maria C; Fernandez, Victoria; Aldunate, Sara; Le\u00F3n, Cristobal; Merino, Pedro; Blanco, Jes\u00FAs; Martin-Sanchez, Fernando; Rico, Lucia; Varillas, David; Iglesias, Veronica; Marcos, Maria \u00C1ngeles; Gand\u00EDa, Francisco; Bobillo, Felipe; Nogueira, Bego\u00F1a; Rojo, Silvia; Resino, Salvador; Castro, Carmen; Ortiz de Lejarazu, Raul; Kelvin, David","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3149d976fd2e03be5159c041a0241f00597e097.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3219262.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20840779/; https://doi.org/10.1186/cc9259","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe patients","adaptive immune responses","severe cases of pandemic influenza","host immune responses","ill patients","majority of patients","severe patient group","IPA analysis","late period of adaptive immune response","clinical outcome","severe lower respiratory complications","number of genes","disease outcome","early period of innate immune response","generation of antibody responses","Ingenuity pathway analysis","B-cell development","impaired expression","impaired development of adaptive immunity","influenza pneumonia","gene expression","rare cases","granzyme B","cytokine profiles","innate cytokine-chemokine release","unremitting cycle of viral replication","Ingenuity Systems","deleterious cycle","late phase","gene ontology","disease onset","comparison groups","persistence of viral secretion","T-helper cell differentiation","pH1N1 specific antibody production","CD28","elevated levels of immunosuppressory cytokines","proinflammatory hypercytokinemia","interleukin","apoptosis","day","antigen presentation","hospitalization","Redwood City","poorest outcomes","canonical pathways","findings","function","association","protein ubiquitination","presence of comorbidities","absence of immunosuppressive conditions","virus","serum","Interruption","CONCLUSIONS","Hierarchical clustering","METHODS","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","Array Tools"],"language":"en"},

Based upon the use of LearnCoil-VMF, as well as other computational tools, we report detailed sequence analyses of coiled-coil-like regions in retrovirus, paramyxovirus and filovirus membrane-fusion proteins. Additionally, sequence analyses of these proteins outside their putative coiled-coil domains illustrate some structural differences between them. Complementing previous crystallographic studies, the coiled-coil-like regions detected by LearnCoil-VMF provide further evidence that the three-stranded coiled coil is a common motif found in many diverse viral membrane-fusion proteins. The abundance and structural conservation of this motif, even in the absence of sequence homology, suggests that it is critical for viral-cellular membrane fusion.

However, prolonged evaluation in the emergency department (ED) may not be required for all patients. As a quality improvement initiative, we implemented an algorithm for rapid assessment of febrile travelers (RAFT) in an ambulatory setting. METHODS: Criteria for RAFT referral include: presentation to the ED, reported fever and travel to the tropics or subtropics within the past year. Exclusion criteria include Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and fulfilment of admission criteria such as unstable vital signs or significant laboratory derangements. We performed a time series analysis preimplementation and postimplementation, with primary outcome of wait time to tropical medicine consultation. Secondary outcomes included number of ED visits averted for repeat malaria testing, and algorithm adherence. RESULTS: From February 2014 to December 2015, 154 patients were seen in the RAFT clinic: 68 men and 86 women. Median age was 36 years (range 16\u201378 years). Mean time to RAFT clinic assessment was 1.2\u00B10.07 days (range 0\u20134 days) postimplementation, compared to 5.4\u00B11.8 days (range 0\u201326 days) prior to implementation (p\u003C0.0001). The RAFT clinic averted 132 repeat malaria screens in the ED over the study period (average 6 per month). Common diagnoses were: traveller\u0027s diarrhoea (n=27, 17.5%), dengue (n=12, 8%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (n=11, 7%), chikungunya (n=10, 6.5%), laboratory-confirmed influenza (n=8, 5%) and lobar pneumonia (n=8, 5%). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to provision of more timely care to ambulatory febrile returned travellers, we reduced ED bed-usage by providing an alternate setting for follow-up malaria screening, and treatment of infectious diseases manageable in an outpatient setting, but requiring specific therapy.","publish_time":"2016-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jazuli, Farah; Lynd, Terence; Mah, Jordan; Klowak, Michael; Jechel, Dale; Klowak, Stefanie; Ovens, Howard; Sabbah, Sam; Boggild, Andrea K","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61d252869a226c4393e4637cb90fa3b4df082ae3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4985841.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27473947/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010302","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["RAFT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RAFT clinic","days","RAFT referral","ambulatory setting","clinic assessment","repeat malaria testing","repeat malaria screens","number of ED visits","ED bed-usage","follow-up malaria screening","Plasmodium falciparum malaria","outpatient setting","alternate setting","Exclusion criteria","postimplementation","Mean time","Fever","years","patients","ambulatory febrile returned travellers","fulfilment of admission criteria","rapid assessment of febrile travelers","emergency department","algorithm adherence","time series analysis preimplementation","potential medical emergency","significant laboratory derangements","unstable vital signs","timely care","prompt attention","treatment of infectious diseases manageable","primary outcome","viral upper respiratory tract infection","provision","presentation","study period","subtropics","addition","tropical medicine consultation","average","Secondary outcomes","traveller\u0027s diarrhoea","life-threatening illnesses","Common diagnoses","prolonged evaluation","past year","month","specific therapy","BACKGROUND","Median age","METHODS","quality improvement initiative","lobar pneumonia","CONCLUSIONS","women","influenza","dengue","chikungunya","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This period has coincided with renewed interest in developing effective interventions, including the isolation of potent monoclonal antibodies and small molecules and the design of novel vaccine candidates.

A number of bacteria cause pathology in the gut of fish and this can be a route of systemic infection in many instances, comparable to that of invasive enteropathogens of mammals. To adhere successfully, colonize, and produce disease, the pathogen must overcome the host defence system. Adhesion of bacteria to surfaces such as epithelial cells involves different types of interaction, depending on the distance separating the bacteria from the surface. The indigenous intestinal flora is prevented from gaining access to other sites in the body by a single epithelial cell layer on the mucosa. The mechanisms that help the bacteria to translocate from the gut to appear in other organs are an important phenomenon in the pathogenesis of opportunistic infections by indigenous intestinal bacteria. Entry into host cells is a specialized strategy for survival and multiplication utilized by a number of pathogens that can exploit existing eukaryotic internalization pathways. Methods including the use of expressed markers such as green fluorescent protein and laser confocal microscopy will provide more definitive analysis of pathways of invasion by pathogens taken up via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Birkbeck, T.

Inflammatory leukocyte infiltrations, hemorrhages and fibrosis of alveolar walls can be observed 2\u201311 days after MHV-A59 infection.

Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a worldwide prevalence of about 1% of the population. The clinical symptoms include multiple motor and one or more phonic (vocal) tics. Germane to this communication is that 85% of patients with GTS have associated psychiatric co-morbidities, many of which are being exacerbated in the current global health crisis. In addition, several symptoms of GTS may mimic COVID-19, such as a dry cough and sniffing (phonic tics), while other symptoms such as spitting, inappropriate touching of others and \u201Cnon-obscene socially inappropriate symptoms\u201D can potentially get patients with GTS into trouble with the law. We suggest that a clear explanation of the COVID-19 illness and GTS is important to enable colleagues of various specialities who tend to patients with GTS. It is important to acknowledge at the outset that the information available on the COVID-19 pandemic changes daily, including cases infected, deaths reported, and how various national health systems are planning and or coping or not. It is fair to say that having read the current medical and lay press we conclude that it is not easy to reassure our patients with absolute certainty.

The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs.

METHODS: We extended and optimized our previous recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5)\u2013based vaccine platform characterized by in vivo amplified and CD40-mediated specific responses to generate MERS-CoV S1 subunit-based vaccine. We generated rAd5 constructs expressing CD40-targeted S1 fusion protein (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L), untargeted S1 (rAd5-S1), and Green Fluorescent Protein (rAd5-GFP), and evaluated their efficacy and safety in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 transgenic (hDPP4 Tg(\u002B)) mice. RESULTS: Immunization of hDPP4 Tg(\u002B) mice with a single dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L elicited as robust and significant specific immunoglobulin G and neutralizing antibodies as those induced with 2 doses of rAd5-S1. After MERS-CoV challenge, both vaccines conferred complete protection against morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by significantly undetectable/reduced pulmonary viral loads compared to the control group. However, rAd5-S1\u2013 but not rAd5-S1/F/CD40L\u2013immunized mice exhibited marked pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage post\u2013MERS-CoV challenge despite the observed protection. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of CD40L into rAd5-based MERS-CoV S1 vaccine targeting molecule and molecular adjuvants not only enhances immunogenicity and efficacy but also prevents inadvertent pulmonary pathology after viral challenge, thereby offering a promising strategy to enhance safety and potency of vaccines.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hashem, Anwar M; Algaissi, Abdullah; Agrawal, Anurodh Shankar; Al-amri, Sawsan S; Alhabbab, Rowa Y; Sohrab, Sayed S; S.

Tracer gas experiments conducted on the eighth floor, where the initial patient was hospitalized, confirmed that the tracer gas spread to adjacent patient rooms and rooms across corridors. In particular, the experiment with an external wind direction and speed similar to those during the hospitalization of the initial patient revealed that the air change rate was 17\u201320 air changes per hour (ACH), with air introduced through the window in the room of the infected patient (room 8104). The tracer gas concentration of room 8110, which was the farthest room, was 7.56% of room 8104, indicating that a high concentration of gas has spread from room 8104 to rooms across the corridor. In contrast, the tracer gas was barely detected in a maternity ward to the south of room 8104, where there was no secondary infected patient. Moreover, MERS is known to spread mainly by droplets through close contact, but long-distance dispersion is probable in certain environments, such as that of a super-spreader patient hospitalized in a room without ventilation, hospitals with a central corridor type, and indoor airflow dispersion due to external wind.","publish_time":"2018-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sung, Minki; Jo, Seongmin; Lee, Sang-Eun; Ki, Moran; Choi, Bo Youl; Hong, JinKwan","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19f5eb39de2aef11b4e3b8c0fa4b92f048057d83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6313554.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15122757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30563206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY0LmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1708223,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"54WIXZ7kvhcpJBgdJU2MFw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_64.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pyeongtaek St. Mary\u2019s Hospital","MERS"],"locations":["South Korea","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["south of room","tracer gas concentration of room","initial patient","farthest room","adjacent patient rooms","super-spreader patient","secondary infected patient","Tracer gas experiments","high concentration of gas","air changes","MERS","study","indoor airflow dispersion","external wind direction","air change rate","long-distance dispersion","airflow investigation","South Korea","central corridor type","Pyeongtaek","Mary\u2019s Hospital","speed similar","hospitals","ventilation","close contact","series of epidemiologic investigations","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","certain environments","hospitalization","floor","corridors","maternity ward","droplets","results","hour","window","contrast","individuals"],"language":"en"},

Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) employs a photosensitizer, light, and oxygen to create a local burst of reactive oxygen species that inactivate microorganisms. The botanical plant extract Orthoquin(TM) is a powerful photosensitizer with antimicrobial properties. Here we report that Orthoquin also has antiviral properties. Photoactivated Orthoquin inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection of target cells in a dose-dependent manner across a broad range of sub-cytotoxic concentrations. HSV inactivation required direct contact between Orthoquin and the inoculum, whereas pre-treatment of target cells had no effect. Orthoquin did not cause appreciable damage to viral capsids or premature release of viral genomes, as measured by qPCR for the HSV-1 genome. By contrast, immunoblotting for HSV-1 antigens in purified virion preparations suggested that higher doses of Orthoquin had a physical impact on certain HSV-1 proteins that altered protein mobility or antigen detection. Orthoquin PDI also inhibited the non-enveloped adenovirus (AdV) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Orthoquin-mediated inhibition of the enveloped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was light-independent. Together, these findings suggest that the broad antiviral effects of Orthoquin-mediated PDI may stem from damage to viral attachment proteins.","publish_time":"2018-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monjo, Andrea L.-A.; Pringle, Eric S.; Thornbury, Mackenzie; Duguay, Brett A.; Monro, Susan M.

METHODS: Of the infants with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) between September 2011 and May 2012, 88 were confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and hospitalized. Systemic interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03B3), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and Treg-type cytokine (IL-10) responses were examined with multiplex assay using acute phase serum samples. RESULTS: Of the 88 patients, 38 had an RV infection (RV group) and 50 had an RSV infection (RSV group). In the RV group, the IFN-\u03B3 and IL-10 concentrations were higher in the patients with than in the patients without wheezing (P=0.022 and P=0.007, respectively). In the RSV group, the differences in IFN-\u03B3 and IL-10 concentrations did not reach statistical significance between the patients with and the patients without wheezing (P=0.105 and P=0.965, respectively).

Yet, in contrast to most other childhood infections as well as other viral and bacterial diseases, prophylactic vaccines or effective antiviral treatments against viral respiratory infections are either still not available, or provide only limited protection. Given the widespread prevalence, a general lack of natural sterilizing immunity, and/or high morbidity and lethality rates of diseases caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses, this difficult situation is a genuine societal challenge. A thorough understanding of the virus-host interactions during these respiratory infections will most probably be pivotal to ultimately meet these challenges. This review attempts to provide a comparative overview of the knowledge about an important part of the interaction between respiratory viruses and their host: the arms race between host innate immunity and viral innate immune evasion. Many, if not all, viruses, including the respiratory viruses listed above, suppress innate immune responses to gain a window of opportunity for efficient virus replication and setting-up of the infection. The consequences for the host\u0027s immune response are that it is often incomplete, delayed or diminished, or displays overly strong induction (after the delay) that may cause tissue damage. The affected innate immune response also impacts subsequent adaptive responses, and therefore viral innate immune evasion often undermines fully protective immunity. In this review, innate immune responses relevant for respiratory viruses with an RNA genome will briefly be summarized, and viral innate immune evasion based on shielding viral RNA species away from cellular innate immune sensors will be discussed from different angles. Subsequently, viral enzymatic activities that suppress innate immune responses will be discussed, including activities causing host shut-off and manipulation of stress granule formation. Furthermore, viral protease-mediated immune evasion and viral manipulation of the ubiquitin system will be addressed. Finally, perspectives for use of the reviewed knowledge for the development of novel antiviral strategies will be sketched.","publish_time":"2019-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kikkert, Marjolein","journal":"Journal of Innate Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7d7becce068c6baa25e2e26becddaf5ae7f55c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6959104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610541/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000503030","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral innate immune evasion","innate immune responses","viral respiratory infections","viral manipulation","affected innate immune response","respiratory viruses","host innate immunity","cellular innate immune sensors","viral protease","immune responses relevant","host\u0027s immune response","viral RNA species","viral enzymatic activities","respiratory syncytial virus","impact of respiratory virus infections","virus-host interactions","childhood infections","subsequent adaptive responses","protective immunity","efficient virus replication","bacterial diseases","reviewed knowledge","RNA genome","review attempts","general lack of natural sterilizing immunity","effective antiviral treatments","lethality rates of diseases","development of novel antiviral strategies","manipulation of stress granule formation","prophylactic vaccines","influenza","coronaviruses","window of opportunity","arms race","difficult situation","high morbidity","rhinoviruses","health of children","comparative overview","delay","genuine societal challenge","widespread prevalence","thorough understanding","ubiquitin system","strong induction","adults","perspectives","consequences","different angles","tissue damage","limited protection","contrast","challenges"],"language":"en"},

We describe the pulmonary pathology of patients who died in the 2003 Toronto outbreak. Autopsy material from the lungs of 20 patients who died between March and July 2003 were characterized by histology, molecular biology, and immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins, thyroid transcription factor-1, CD68, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes simplex viruses. Matched controls were obtained from patients who died of other causes over the same interval. The mean duration of illness was 27 days (range 5\u2013108 days). Post-mortem lung tissues from 19 of 20 patients with probable SARS were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR. Histologically, all patients showed varying degrees of exudative and proliferative phase acute lung injury, evidenced in conventional and immunohistochemical stains by edema, inflammatory infiltrate, pneumocyte hyperplasia, fibrinous exudates, and organization. Eight of 20 patients showed predominantly a diffuse alveolar damage pattern of acute lung injury, six showed predominantly an acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia pattern, and the remainder showed an admixture of the two patterns. Squamous metaplasia and scattered multinucleate giant cells were present in most cases. Vascular fibrin thrombi were a common finding and were often associated with pulmonary infarcts. Special stains demonstrated vascular endothelial damage of both small- and mid-sized pulmonary vessels. Two cases were complicated by invasive fungal disease consistent with Aspergillosis, and another by coinfection with cytomegalovirus. Our findings indicate that the lungs of patients who die of SARS are almost always positive for the SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR, and may show features of both diffuse alveolar damage and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia patterns of acute injury.

In addition to activating the complement, MBL can induce cytokine production and contribute to a deleterious inflammatory response with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. Our aim was to determine if serum MBL levels correlate with the risk of mortality in intensive care units (ICU) patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. METHODS: Prospective observational study was performed in ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Demographic characteristics and severity indices were recorded at ICU admission. MBL was assayed from blood drawn at influenza diagnosis within 24\u201348 h following the ICU admission. Outcomes were compared according to MBL levels. Results are expressed as median and interquartile range. RESULTS: Serum MBL levels were studied in 27 patients (age: 56 [IQR 29] years) with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and in 70 healthy controls. Median admission SAPSII and SOFA scores were 49 [IQR 26] and 12 [IQR 5], respectively. Mortality rate after a 30-day was 37%. MBL was significantly higher in non-survivors (3741 [IQR 2336] ng/ml) vs survivors (215 [IQR 1307] ng/ml), p = 0.006, as well as control group (1814 [IQR 2250] ng/ml), p = 0.01. In contrast, MBL levels in survivors group were significantly lower than the controls group (215 [IQR 1307] ng/ml vs. 1814 [IQR 2250] ng/ml, p = 0.005). MBL cut-off \u003E 1870 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 88.2% for mortality [AUC = 0.82 (95% CI 0.63\u20130.94)].

METHODS: Clinical data were collected from critical infants with EV71 infection. The infants were grouped into PE, non-PE, and control groups. The control group included infants in the preoperative period of elective inguinal hernia surgery. Biochemical changes in PE fluid were evaluated, and Ang-2 levels in serum and PE fluid were measured. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were incubated with serum from the control and PE groups and human recombinant Ang-2 or serum from the PE group and human recombinant Ang-1, and changes in the intercellular junctions were recorded via immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Of the 161 infants with critical EV71 infection admitted to the hospital, 39 had PE. PE fluid was collected from 18 of these infants. The PE fluid-to-serum (P/S) ratio of total protein was 0.9 \u00B1 0.2, and all P/S ratios of albumin were 1.0 \u00B1 0.3. The Ang-2 level was higher in the non-PE group (333.2 \u00B1 79.7 pg/ml) than in the control group (199.9 \u00B1 26.7 pg/ml), although without statistical significance (P = 0.115). The Ang-2 level in the PE group (2819.2 \u00B1 908.7 pg/ml) was higher than those in both the non-PE and the control groups (both, P \u003C 0.001). Serum samples from the PE group had damaged cell junctions of confluent HPMEC monolayers that were reversed by Ang-1. CONCLUSIONS: The PE fluid of infants with EV71-induced PE was protein-rich, and elevated Ang-2 expression was associated with PE.

Despite diuretic therapy, along with aspirin, statins and antibiotics the patient continued to complain of severe dyspnea and had a moderate fever. Thus, diagnostic hypotheses different from acute cardiac failure were considered, in particular non-cardiogenic causes of pulmonary infiltrates. Following suspicion of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, the drug was discontinued and corticosteroid therapy was initiated. Due to the deterioration of the clinical picture, we proceeded to intubation. After few hours from intubation we were forced to institute a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to the worsening of pulmonary function. The patient\u2019s clinical condition improved which allowed us to remove the ECMO after 15 days of treatment. Indications for use of ECMO have expanded considerably. To our knowledge this is the first successful, reported article of a veno-venous ECMO used to treat amiodarone-induced toxicity in an adult.

During the fifth wave, a highly pathogenic H7N9 strain emerged. Meanwhile, the H7N9 virus continues to accumulate mutations, and its affinity for the human respiratory epithelial sialic acid 2\u20136 receptor has increased. Therefore, a pandemic is still possible. In the past 6 years, we have accumulated rich experience in dealing with H7N9, especially in terms of virus tracing, epidemiological research, key site mutation monitoring, critical disease mechanisms, clinical treatment, and vaccine development. In the research fields above, significant progress has been made to effectively control the spread of the epidemic and reduce the fatality rate. To fully document the research progress concerning H7N9, we reviewed the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of H7N9, the key gene mutations of the virus, and H7N9 vaccine, thus providing a scientific basis for further monitoring and prevention of H7N9 influenza epidemics.

Influenza A virus infection evolves into a severe respiratory failure in some young adult patients, related to an exaggerated inflammatory response. Mortality rates remain high despite antiviral treatment and aggressive respiratory support. The influenza A virus (IAV) infection will induce a proinflammatory innate immune response through recognition of viral RNA by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) molecules by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03BAB route). Anti-inflammatory therapies focused on modulating this inflammatory response to \u201Call patients\u201D have not been satisfactory. Steroids should be avoided because they do not improve survival and promote superinfections. Since clinical judgment has often been proven inadequate, interest in the use of biomarkers to monitor host response and to assess severity and complications is growing. It is well known that, if used appropriately, these can be helpful tools to predict not only severity but also mortality. We need more biomarkers that predict host response: it is time to change lactate measurement to proteomics and transcriptomics. Theranostics describes an approach covering both diagnosis and coupled therapy. Death is usually a fatal complication of a dysregulated immune response more than the acute virulence of the infectious agent. Future research demonstrating the usefulness of adjunctive therapy in a subset of critically ill patients with IAV pneumonia is an unmet clinical need.","publish_time":"2016-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valenzuela-S\u00E1nchez, F.; Valenzuela-M\u00E9ndez, B.; Rodr\u00EDguez-Guti\u00E9rrez, J.

However, despite the accumulating body of evidence to suggest that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is associated with pneumonia, the exact role played by this virus in this process is still not fully understood. Therefore, to identify patients at risk, we have conducted a case\u2013control study to characterize patients with HSV-1-positive pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2009, all patients with suspected viral pneumonia were tested for the presence of herpes viruses using a PCR assay approach with respiratory specimens. To identify possible associations, risk factors, and impact of HSV, HSV-1-positive ICU patients (n = 51) were compared to age-, gender-, and department- and season-matched HSV-negative patients (n = 52). RESULTS: HSV-positive patients differed significantly from the HSV-negative ones only in terms of time of mechanical ventilation (13 vs. 6 days, respectively; p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis in the patients aged \u003E60 years and in those without bacterial detection revealed a similar trend (p = 0.01 and p = 0.004, respectively). Mortality did not differ between the groups or between the HSV-1-positive patients treated with aciclovir and those who were not. A viral load \u003E10E\u002B05 geq/ml was associated with mechanical ventilation (20/21 vs. 17/29; p = 0.004), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; 19/21 vs. 18/29; p = 0.005), sepsis (18/21 vs. 14/29; p = 0.008), detection of a bacterial pathogen in the same specimen (10/21 vs. 4/29; p = 0.01) and longer ICU stay (25 vs. 30 days; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Despite several associations with high viral load, the clinical outcome of HSV-1-positive ICU patients did not differ significantly from the clinical outcome of HSV-negative patients. This finding indicates that HSV-1 viral loads in respiratory specimens are a symptom of a clinically poor condition rather than a cause of it. Longitudinal and therapy studies are therefore needed to distinguish between HSV-1 as a causative pathogen and HSV-1 as a bystander of pneumonia/ARDS.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scheithauer, S.; Manemann, A.

However, several limitations regarding off-target effects and immune stimulation of nucleic acid drugs hamper their translation into the clinical practice.

Key to understanding their function is recognition of their pleiotropism and often overlapping and functional redundancies. Classified here into 9 main families, most of the 20 approved cytokine preparations (18 different cytokines; 3 pegylated), all in recombinant human (rh) form, are grouped in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor \u03B2 (TGF\u03B2) families. In the hematopoietin family, approved cytokines are aldesleukin (rhIL-2), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim (rhG-CSF), sargramostim (rhGM-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin) and the rh-erythropoietins, epoetin and darbepoietin alfa. Anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1, is in the IL-1 family; recombinant interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1 and gamma-1 make up the interferon family; palifermin (rhKGF) and becaplermin (rhPDGF) are in the PDGF family; and rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7 represent the TGF\u03B2 family. The main physicochemical features, FDA-approved indications, modes of action and side effects of these approved cytokines are presented. Underlying each adverse events profile is their pleiotropism, potency and capacity to release other cytokines producing cytokine \u2018cocktails\u2019. Side effects, some serious, occur despite cytokines being endogenous proteins, and this therefore demands caution in attempts to introduce individual members into the clinic. This caution is reflected in the relatively small number of cytokines currently approved by regulatory agencies and by the fact that 14 of the FDA-approved preparations carry warnings, with 10 being black box warnings.","publish_time":"2014-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baldo, Brian A.","journal":"Drug Saf","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfeb1497c4a516516379e063b6f2170e71f8b0ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101846.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101846/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzIwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["approved cytokines","different cytokines","small number of cytokines","interferon family","PDGF family","TGF\u03B2 family","FDA-approved preparations","approved cytokine preparations","FDA-approved indications","hematopoietin family","hematopoietic growth factor","growth factor \u03B2","recombinant interferons alfa","platelet-derived growth factor","pleiotropism","rh-erythropoietins","recombinant human","rh-leptin","darbepoietin alfa","key","rhIL","rhBMP","main families","caution","effects","recombinant receptor antagonist","rhG-CSF","rhGM-CSF","tbo-filgrastim","endogenous proteins","small MW","main physicochemical features","black box warnings","immunity","cellular activities","infection","rhKGF","potency","modes of action","aldesleukin","inflammation","individual members","sargramostim","metreleptin","kDa","epoetin","form","rhPDGF","palifermin","capacity","adverse events profile","regulatory agencies","malignancy","becaplermin","attempts","Anakinra","recognition","clinic","functional redundancies","gamma","beta","oprelvekin","cocktails\u2019"],"language":"en"},

One hypothesis suggests that CMV-P is an immunopathological condition that is common in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) under the effects of an abnormally regenerating immune system that reacts against CMV infected lung tissue. Such a hypothesis implicates CD4 T lymphocytes as one of the critical cell populations involved in immunopathology and also suggests that this process would be aborted by CD4 T cell deficiency in HIV infection. However, studies correlating the onset of CMV-P with lymphocyte reconstitution following BMT have revealed that CD4 cells are present at very low frequencies in the blood during the early period after transplantation when most cases of CMV-P occur. Furthermore, studies directly investigating bronchoalveolar lavage cell types during episodes of CMV-P in BMT patients have also failed to demonstrate significant CD4 involvement and, instead, have emphasized a predominance of natural killer (NK) cells and CD8 cells. These findings serve as the basis for questioning the validity of a CD4-driven immunopathological model of CMV-P in BMT. On the other hand, a variety of experimental and clinical observations support the protective role of CMV-specific CD3(\u002B) CD8 T lymphocytes against CMV in both immunocompetent individuals and BMT patients. In a murine BMT model, adoptive transfer of syngeneic BM cells was associated with massive increases in lung CD8 cells which resulted in the resolution rather than the exacerbation of existing CMV-P. In the light of these findings a more plausible hypothesis for CMV-P in BMT is that during the early period after transplantation adequate protective CD8 responses are absent and an uncontrolled CMV proliferation is allowed to develop. Once a critical viral load is reached a cytokine \u2018storm\u2019 may be triggered in the lung tissue that aggravates direct CMV-associated cytopathic effects. Likely candidates for this process would include the release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03B1) from alveolar macrophages stimulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03B3) released from NK cells that are reconstituted early after BMT.

Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy, the outcomes of HSCT for XIAP deficiency remain unsatisfactory compared with those for SLAM-associated protein deficiency and familial HLH. AIM: To investigate the outcomes and adverse events of HSCT for patients with XIAP deficiency, a national survey was conducted. METHODS: A spreadsheet questionnaire was sent to physicians who had provided HSCT treatment for patients with XIAP deficiency in Japan. RESULTS: Up to the end of September 2016, 10 patients with XIAP deficiency had undergone HSCT in Japan, 9 of whom (90%) had survived. All surviving patients had received a fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. Although 5 patients developed post-HSCT HLH, 4 of them survived after etoposide administration. In addition, the IBD associated with XIAP deficiency improved remarkably after HSCT in all affected cases. CONCLUSION: The RIC regimen and HLH control might be important factors for successful HSCT outcomes, with improved IBD, in patients with XIAP deficiency.

Prediction of severe aGvHD as early as possible is crucial to allow timely initiation of treatment. Here we report on a multicentre validation of an aGvHD-specific urinary proteomic classifier (aGvHD_MS17) in 423 patients. Samples (n=1106) were collected prospectively between day \u002B7 and day \u002B130 and analyzed using capillary electrophoresis coupled on-line to mass spectrometry. Integration of aGvHD_MS17 analysis with demographic and clinical variables using a logistic regression model led to correct classification of patients developing severe aGvHD 14 days before any clinical signs with 82.4% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity. Multivariate regression analysis showed that aGvHD_MS17 positivity was the only strong predictor for aGvHD grade III or IV (P\u003C0.0001). The classifier consists of 17 peptides derived from albumin, \u03B22-microglobulin, CD99, fibronectin and various collagen \u03B1-chains, indicating inflammation, activation of T cells and changes in the extracellular matrix as early signs of GvHD-induced organ damage. This study is currently the largest demonstration of accurate and investigator-independent prediction of patients at risk for severe aGvHD, thus allowing preemptive therapy based on proteomic profiling.

Increased global travel has resulted in an escalation in the number of imported cases seen in developed countries. Patients with malaria may present for surgery in both endemic and non-endemic countries. This article reviews the perioperative considerations when managing patients with malaria. SOURCE: A literature review of anesthesia, perioperative care, and malaria-related articles was performed using the MEDLINE(\u00AE), EMBASE\u2122, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant articles published in English during 1945-2014. Of the 303 articles matching the search criteria, 265 were excluded based on title and abstract. Eleven of the remaining 38 articles were relevant to anesthesia/perioperative care, and 27 articles were identified as having direct relevance to critical care medicine. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The majority of imported malaria cases are caused by the falciparum species, which is associated with the greatest degree of morbidity and mortality. Various organ systems may be impacted as a consequence of changes in the structure and function of parasitized erythrocytes. Preoperative assessment should focus on establishing the species of malaria, the severity of disease, assessing the degree of end-organ impairment, and initiating treatment of malaria prior to surgery. Intravenous artesunate is the treatment of choice for severe falciparum malaria. Quinine is a second-line agent but has a narrow therapeutic index and particularly hazardous side effects. Intraoperatively, attention should focus on fluid management, dynamics of cerebral blood flow, and avoidance of hypoglycemia. Postoperative care of severe cases should ideally take place in a critical care unit as there may be ongoing requirements for multi-organ support, including renal replacement therapy, ventilation, and/or inotropic support. The safety of neuraxial anesthesia has not been well studied in the setting of malaria. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide. Multiple organ systems can be impacted as a consequence of changes in structure and function of parasitized erythrocytes. Safe perioperative management requires a sound knowledge of all these potential system effects.","publish_time":"2014-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soltanifar, Daniel; Carvalho, Brendan; Sultan, Pervez","journal":"Can J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c28a5a90513758f40aa52e13ce686ae85022111e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102007.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102007/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species of malaria","setting of malaria","malaria-related articles","severe falciparum malaria","perioperative care","initiating treatment of malaria","majority of imported malaria cases","relevant articles","Postoperative care of severe cases","critical care unit","critical care medicine","perioperative considerations","organ impairment","Safe perioperative management","multi-organ support","Various organ systems","Multiple organ systems","structure","number of imported cases","surgery","function of parasitized erythrocytes","consequence of changes","falciparum species","Patients","literature review of anesthesia","life-threatening infectious disease","non-endemic countries","safety of neuraxial anesthesia","treatment of choice","fluid management","degree of end","severity of disease","inotropic support","developed countries","potential system effects","greatest degree of morbidity","devastating infectious diseases","sound knowledge","dynamics of cerebral blood flow","renal replacement therapy","ongoing requirements","narrow therapeutic index","ventilation","escalation","direct relevance","line agent","Web of Science databases","avoidance of hypoglycemia","Plasmodium parasite","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","EMBASE","mortality","Intravenous artesunate","SOURCE","MEDLINE","PURPOSE","global travel","Quinine","attention","search criteria","English","Preoperative assessment","title","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term neurodevelopment of patients with SCID following myeloablative chemotherapy and HSCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen pediatric patients diagnosed with SCID were tested using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the validated Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) pre- and 1-year post-HSCT. Three years post-HSCT, there were 11 patients available for testing and four patients available 5 years post-HSCT. Patients greater than 3 years of age were administered the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Both raw scores and scaled scores were analyzed. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease 1 year post-HSCT in the Bayley Mental Developmental Index (MDI) [92.5 (pre) vs. 70.81 (1 year post), p \u003C 0.0001] and the VABS [99.73 (pre) vs. 79.87 (1 year post), p = \u003C0.0001]. There was a significant decrease over time in the MDI [95.00 (pre) vs. 72.64 (1 year post) vs. 71.82 (3 years post), p \u003C 0.0001], but no significant change between 1 and 3 years post-HSCT. There was no change in the Bayley Psychomotor Development Scale (PDI) [82.4 (pre) vs. 84.8 (1 year post), p = 0.68]. The PDI scores decreased over time [86.29 (pre) vs. 86 (1 year post) vs. 74.14 (3 years post), p = 0.045]. Although there was a decrease in scaled scores, there was not a loss of skills. Analysis of raw scores showed that there was an increase in the raw test scores, which indicated that these children acquired developmental skills, but at a slower rate than normal infants and toddlers. Younger children had a more significant decrease in adaptive scores compared with older children. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may reflect the effects of the isolation and prolonged hospitalization that characterizes the immediate post-transplant period. Patients miss out on social interactions and learning opportunities that normally occur at their respective stages of development. These restrictions keep patients from acquiring developmentally appropriate cognitive skills as well as gross and fine motor developmental milestones. Longitudinal follow-up will be important to quantify acquisition of skills.","publish_time":"2008-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Malinda; Epport, Karen; Azen, Colleen; Parkman, Robertson; Kohn, Donald B.; Shah, Ami J.","journal":"J Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc7bb6b3118dfc95392cfbc36a89919e85881486.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102058.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102058/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT","Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales","Wechsler Preschool","VABS","PDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["year post-HSCT","years post-HSCT","patients available","pediatric patients","Patients greater","adaptive scores","PDI scores","scaled scores","significant decrease","raw test scores","Analysis of raw scores","developmental skills","years of age","long-term neurodevelopment of patients","SCID","significant change","acquisition of skills","loss of skills","Bayley Scales of Infant Development","Bayley Psychomotor Development Scale","immediate post-transplant period","Bayley Mental Developmental Index","VABS","MDI","appropriate cognitive skills","older children","Younger children","time","respective stages of development","fine motor developmental milestones","validated Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales","Primary Scale of Intelligence","Wechsler Preschool","prolonged hospitalization","slower rate","Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","severe combined immunodeficiency","cure","testing","myeloablative chemotherapy","effects","normal infants","toddlers","BACKGROUND","social interactions","increase","learning opportunities","study","isolation","MATERIALS","METHODS","Longitudinal follow-up","findings","restrictions","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","purpose"],"language":"en"},

In contrast to virus genetics determinants, host genetic factors with clinical impact remained unexplored until recently. The association between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and influenza outcome in a European population was investigated in the present study. All samples were collected during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 post-pandemic period 2010\u201311 and a sufficient number of severe and fatal cases was included. Host genomic DNA was isolated from pharyngeal samples of 110 patients from northern Greece with severe (n = 59) or mild (n = 51) influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 disease, at baseline, and the genotype of CD55 rs2564978, C1QBP rs3786054 and FCGR2A rs1801274 SNPs was investigated. Our findings suggest a relationship between the two complement-related SNPs, namely, the rare TT genotype of CD55 and the rare AA genotype of C1QBP with increased death risk. No significant differences were observed for FCGR2A genotypes neither with fatality nor disease severity. Additional large-scale genetic association studies are necessary for the identification of reliable host genetic risk factors associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outcome. Prophylactic intervention of additional high-risk populations, according to their genetic profile, will be a key achievement for the fight against influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2018-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chatzopoulou, Fani; Gioula, Georgia; Kioumis, Ioannis; Chatzidimitriou, Dimitris; Exindari, Maria","journal":"Med Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db54ae914686012f83d30685df55e0581b07222e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102177.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzMzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza"],"locations":["Greece"],"keyphrases":["influenza outcome","host genetic factors","extensive study of influenza viruses","H1N1","genetic profile","pdm09 disease","pdm09 outcome","identification of reliable host genetic risk factors","rare AA genotype of C1QBP","genotype of CD55 rs2564978","rare TT genotype of CD55","Additional large-scale genetic association studies","FCGR2A rs1801274 SNPs","Host genomic DNA","complement-related SNPs","C1QBP rs3786054","FCGR2A genotypes","pharyngeal samples","pdm09 post-pandemic period","present study","disease severity","increased death risk","sufficient number of severe","Prophylactic intervention of additional high-risk populations","virus genetics determinants","human health","northern Greece","clinical impact","patients","key achievement","single nucleotide polymorphisms","baseline","European population","fatal cases","contrast","fatality","important threat","production of effective vaccines","fight","relationship","significant differences","findings"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty adult patients (nine women and 11 men; mean age 43.5\u00B116.4 years) with a diagnosis of H1N1 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab came to our attention from September to November 2009 and were followed up until September 2010. All patients were hospitalised in consideration of the severity of clinical findings, and all underwent chest X-ray. Twelve of them underwent at least one computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. RESULTS: In 75% of cases (15/20), there was complete resolution of the clinical and radiological findings. Twenty-five percent of patients (5/20) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which progressed to predominantly peripheral pulmonary fibrosis in 10% (2/20; one died and one had late-onset pulmonary fibrosis, documented on day 68). Moreover, in one patient with a CT diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, we observed progressive regression of radiological findings over 4 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with H1N1 pneumonia, post-ARDS pulmonary fibrosis is not a rare complication. Therefore, a CT scan should be performed in all patients with severe clinical findings. Our study demonstrated that in these patients, fibrosis could present a different spatial distribution and a different temporal trend, with delayed late onset; moreover, in one case, the signs of interstitial lung disease partially regressed over time. Therefore, CT should be considered not only in the diagnostic stage, but also during the follow-up.","publish_time":"2011-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mineo, G.; Ciccarese, F.; Modolon, C.; Landini, M.

With the intention of generating an anti-tumor immune response, ICIs can also lead to inflammatory side effects involving a wide variety of organs in the body, termed immune-related adverse events. Although no prospective clinical trial exists to guide recommendations for optimal and more specific immunosuppressive treatments rather than corticosteroids, further studies may lead to a more mechanistic-based approach towards these toxicities in the future. In relation to current practice, we recommend adherence to the recent published guidelines which emphasize the importance of early recognition and administration of temporary immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids in most cases, depending on the organ system involved, and the severity of toxicity. Recognition of these toxicities is increasingly important as the use of these agents expand within different indications for patients with lung cancers, and to other tumor types.","publish_time":"2018-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wills, Beatriz; Brahmer, Julie R.; Naidoo, Jarushka","journal":"Curr Treat Options Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28069706de2fb2310f1d037970867265f3f47e43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102206.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["corticosteroids","toxicities","anti-tumor immune response","Immune checkpoint inhibitors","immune-related adverse events","tumor types","specific immunosuppressive treatments","importance of early recognition","administration of temporary immunosuppressive therapy","recommendations","body","different indications","lung cancers","adherence","agents","patients","wide variety of organs","cases","ICIs","recent published guidelines","effects","use","mechanistic-based approach","prospective clinical trial","management of advanced NSCLC","current practice","organ system","studies","intention","severity of toxicity","relation","future"],"language":"en"},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with pulmonary metastases (PM) from HCC who had undergone curative PM-ectomy at National Taiwan University Hospital between 1990 and 2004. Univariate (log-rank) and multivariate (Cox\u2019s model) analyses of survival were used to identify the significant prognostic factors. RESULTS: In total, 34 patients were eligible for curative PM-ectomy. The overall survival rates (Kaplan-Meier) after PM-ectomy were 65.2% and 27.5% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. High alpha-fetoprotein level, positive hepatic resection margin, and short disease-free interval (DFI) were unfavorable factors for overall survival from univariate analysis, however, only DFI (P = 0.028) was identified as an independently prognostic factor by multivariate analysis. Bilateral distribution and more PMs were unfavorable factors for PM-free survival from univariate analysis, with only PM number identified as an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis (P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Patients with longer DFIs and fewer PMs can benefit from PM-ectomy in HCC.","publish_time":"2006-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuo, Shuenn-Wen; Chang, Yih-Leong; Huang, Pei-Ming; Hsu, Hsao-Hsun; Chen, Jin-Shin; Lee, Jang-Ming; Lee, Po-Huang; Lee, Yung-Chie","journal":"Ann Surg Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/507ec4769026bf913eec878987b8fb0c2f00756f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102208.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102208/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCC","National Taiwan University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["curative PM-ectomy","PM number","PM-free survival","univariate analysis","multivariate analysis","unfavorable factors","significant prognostic factors","HCC","analyses of survival","overall survival rates","independent prognostic factor","retrospective review of patients","pulmonary metastases","fewer PMs","pulmonary metastasectomy","positive hepatic resection margin","short disease-free interval","High alpha-fetoprotein level","Kaplan-Meier","National Taiwan University Hospital","longer DFIs","Cox\u2019s model","log-rank","hepatocellular carcinoma","Bilateral distribution","total","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS","PURPOSE","years"],"language":"en"}]}

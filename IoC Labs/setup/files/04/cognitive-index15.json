We assessed the public and philanthropic investments awarded to UK institutions for respiratory infectious disease research to identify areas of underinvestment. We aimed to identify projects and categorise them by pathogen, disease and position along the research and development value chain. SETTING: The UK. PARTICIPANTS: Institutions that host and carry out infectious disease research. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The total amount spent and number of studies with a focus on several different respiratory pathogens or diseases, and to correlate these against the global burden of disease; also the total amount spent and number of studies relating to the type of science, the predominant funder in each category and the mean and median award size. RESULTS: We identified 6165 infectious disease studies with a total investment of \u00A32\u00B76 billion. Respiratory research received \u00A3419 million (16.1%) across 1192 (19.3%) studies. The Wellcome Trust provided greatest investment (\u00A3135.2 million; 32.3%). Tuberculosis received \u00A3155 million (37.1%), influenza \u00A380 million (19.1%) and pneumonia \u00A327.8 million (6.6%). Despite high burden, there was relatively little investment in vaccine-preventable diseases including diphtheria (\u00A30.1 million, 0.03%), measles (\u00A35.0 million, 1.2%) and drug-resistant tuberculosis. There were 802 preclinical studies (67.3%) receiving \u00A3273 million (65.2%), while implementation research received \u00A381 million (19.3%) across 274 studies (23%). There were comparatively few phase I\u2013IV trials or product development studies. Global health research received \u00A368.3 million (16.3%). Relative investment was strongly correlated with 2010 disease burden. CONCLUSIONS: The UK predominantly funds preclinical science. Tuberculosis is the most studied respiratory disease. The high global burden of pneumonia-related disease warrants greater investment than it has historically received. Other priority areas include antimicrobial resistance (particularly within tuberculosis), economics and proactive investments for emerging infectious threats.","publish_time":"2014-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Head, Michael G; Fitchett, Joseph R; Cooke, Mary K; Wurie, Fatima B; Hayward, Andrew C; Lipman, Marc C; Atun, Rifat","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/789ca66c03e2a2aaf30da4cf0df1d25b6b37b9d5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9449746a1b41b08251ce0e1cb8fc5654b2faf043.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3975787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3975787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease burden","infectious disease studies","respiratory infectious disease research","Respiratory research","related disease","studied respiratory disease","large global burden of disease","number of studies","preclinical studies","total investment","Global health research","high burden","implementation research","product development studies","high global burden of pneumonia","Respiratory infections","little investment","greater investment","greatest investment","Relative investment","UK institutions","different respiratory pathogens","emerging infectious threats","preclinical science","drug-resistant tuberculosis","proactive investments","philanthropic investments","type of science","priority areas","areas of underinvestment","vaccine-preventable diseases","development value chain","mean","category","economics","focus","position","predominant funder","SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES","antimicrobial resistance","trials","median award size","diphtheria","Wellcome Trust","OBJECTIVES","phase","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","projects","PARTICIPANTS","SETTING","influenza","measles"],"language":"en"},

Initially, tetherin was shown to restrict replication of various enveloped viruses by inhibiting the release of budding virions from infected cells. More recently, it has become clear that tetherin also acts as a pattern recognition receptor inducing NF-\u03BAB-dependent proinflammatory gene expression in virus infected cells. Whereas the ability to restrict virion release is highly conserved among mammalian tetherin orthologs and thus probably an ancient function of this protein, innate sensing seems to be an evolutionarily recent activity. The potent and broad antiviral activity of tetherin is reflected by the fact that many viruses evolved means to counteract this restriction factor. A continuous arms race with viruses has apparently driven the evolution of different isoforms of tetherin with different functional properties. Interestingly, tetherin has also been implicated in cellular processes that are unrelated to immunity, such as the organization of the apical actin network and membrane microdomains or stabilization of the Golgi apparatus. In this review, I summarize our current knowledge of the different functions of tetherin and describe the molecular strategies that viruses have evolved to antagonize or evade this multifunctional host restriction factor.","publish_time":"2014-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sauter, Daniel","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6dbe5c842f58c1846c7659a0fb4f0da62d137c73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3989765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3989765/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different functions of tetherin","mammalian tetherin orthologs","evolution of different isoforms of tetherin","broad antiviral activity of tetherin","interferon-inducible restriction factor tetherin","multifunctional host restriction factor","replication of various enveloped viruses","virus infected cells","different functional properties","virion release","recent activity","release of budding virions","antiviral immune response","dependent proinflammatory gene expression","NF-\u03BAB","membrane microdomains","stabilization","apical actin network","ancient function","pattern recognition receptor","current knowledge","immunity","innate sensing","protein","organization","key component","CD317","Golgi apparatus","cellular processes","molecular strategies","continuous arms race","BST","HM1","review","ability"],"language":"en"},

Several of the co-opted host factors bind to the viral RNA, which plays multiple roles, including mRNA function, as an assembly platform for the viral replicase (VRC), template for RNA synthesis, and encapsidation during infection. It is likely that remodeling of the viral RNAs and RNA-protein complexes during the switch from one step to another requires RNA helicases. In this paper, we have discovered a second group of cellular RNA helicases, including the eIF4AIII-like yeast Fal1p and the DDX5-like Dbp3p and the orthologous plant AtRH2 and AtRH5 DEAD box helicases, which are co-opted by tombusviruses. Unlike the previously characterized DDX3-like AtRH20/Ded1p helicases that bind to the 3\u2032 terminal promoter region in the viral minus-strand (\u2212)RNA, the other class of eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases bind to a different cis-acting element, namely the 5\u2032 proximal RIII(\u2212) replication enhancer (REN) element in the TBSV (\u2212)RNA. We show that the binding of AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases to the TBSV (\u2212)RNA could unwind the dsRNA structure within the RIII(\u2212) REN. This unique characteristic allows the eIF4AIII-like helicases to perform novel pro-viral functions involving the RIII(\u2212) REN in stimulation of plus-strand (\u002B)RNA synthesis. We also show that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases are components of the tombusvirus VRCs based on co-purification experiments. We propose that eIF4AIII-like helicases destabilize dsRNA replication intermediate within the RIII(\u2212) REN that promotes bringing the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal (\u2212)RNA sequences in close vicinity via long-range RNA-RNA base pairing. This newly formed RNA structure promoted by eIF4AIII helicase together with AtRH20 helicase might facilitate the recycling of the viral replicases for multiple rounds of (\u002B)-strand synthesis, thus resulting in asymmetrical viral replication.","publish_time":"2014-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kovalev, Nikolay; Nagy, Peter D.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5534fcf5c7e7df182da3c253d2312cd5662259b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3990711.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3990711/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzExMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","TBSV","RIII","REN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA synthesis","RNA sequences","strand RNA viruses","long-range RNA-RNA base pairing","group of cellular RNA helicases","AtRH5 helicases","formed RNA structure","RNA-protein complexes","Ded1p helicases","asymmetrical viral replication","viral RNAs","viral replicases","viral minus-strand","AtRH5 DEAD box helicases","eIF4AIII helicase","strand synthesis","class of eIF4AIII","replication enhancer","dsRNA replication intermediate","novel pro-viral functions","proximal RIII","AtRH20 helicase","binding of AtRH2","co-opted host factors","dsRNA structure","TBSV","orthologous plant AtRH2","recruited host factors","multiple roles","multiple rounds","terminal promoter region","different cis-acting element","tombusvirus VRCs","close vicinity","template","assembly platform","mRNA function","Dbp3p","recycling","components","critical steps","DDX5","co-purification experiments","switch","encapsidation","remodeling","yeast Fal1p","characterized DDX3","infection","stimulation","unique characteristic","tombusviruses","paper"],"language":"en"},

However, they do not reach clinical trials because of their low delivery, poor specificity or their incapacity to bypass the plasma membrane. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are an open door for cell-impermeable compounds to reach intracellular targets. Putting all these together, research is sailing in the direction of the design of systems with the capacity to transport new drugs into a target cell.

In this paper, we present the new R package OutbreakTools, which aims to provide a basis for outbreak data management and analysis in R. OutbreakTools is developed by a community of epidemiologists, statisticians, modellers and bioinformaticians, and implements classes and methods for storing, handling and visualizing outbreak data. It includes real and simulated outbreak datasets. Together with a number of tools for infectious disease epidemiology recently made available in R, OutbreakTools contributes to the emergence of a new, free and open-source platform for the analysis of disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2014-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jombart, Thibaut; Aanensen, David M.; Baguelin, Marc; Birrell, Paul; Cauchemez, Simon; Camacho, Anton; Colijn, Caroline; Collins, Caitlin; Cori, Anne; Didelot, Xavier; Fraser, Christophe; Frost, Simon; Hens, Niel; Hugues, Joseph; H\u00F6hle, Michael; Opatowski, Lulla; Rambaut, Andrew; Ratmann, Oliver; Soubeyrand, Samuel; Suchard, Marc A.; Wallinga, Jacco; Ypma, Rolf; Ferguson, Neil","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4058532.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4058532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of disease outbreaks","investigation of infectious disease outbreaks","infectious disease epidemiology","outbreak data management","visualizing outbreak data","diverse data","disease transmission processes","new R package OutbreakTools","new prospects","number of tools","simulated outbreak datasets","unified platform","number of different","open-source platform","bioinformaticians","modellers","handling","insights","public health policies","complementary approaches","statisticians","methods","classes","community of epidemiologists","emergence","basis","paper","potential"],"language":"en"},

Most notably, extracts of the roots of P. sidoides have commonly been applied for the treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea but only occasionally for respiratory complaints. Clinical trials have shown that a modern aqueous-ethanolic formulation of P. sidoides extracts (EPs(\u00AE) 7630) is an efficacious treatment for disorders of the respiratory tract, for example bronchitis and sinusitis. It should be noted that EPs(\u00AE) 7630 is the most widely investigated extract and therefore is the focus of this review. In order to provide a rationale for its therapeutic activity extracts have been evaluated for antibacterial activity and for their effects on non-specific immune functions. Only moderate direct antibacterial capabilities against a spectrum of bacteria, including Mycobacteria strains, have been noted. In contrast, a large body of in vitro studies has provided convincing evidence for an anti-infective principle associated with activation of the non-specific immune system. Interestingly, significant inhibition of interaction between bacteria and host cells, a key to the pathogenesis of respiratory tract infections, has emerged from recent studies. In addition, antiviral effects have been demonstrated, including inhibition of the replication of respiratory viruses and the enzymes haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Besides, an increase of cilliary beat frequency of respiratory cells may contribute to the beneficial effects of P. sidoides extracts. This example provides a compelling argument for continuing the exploration of Nature and traditional medical systems as a source of therapeutically useful herbal medicines.","publish_time":"2011-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kolodziej, Herbert","journal":"Pharmaceuticals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/181d47c4050ebc63d4831f8dd0df88b785bf4985.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4060126.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4060126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southern African"],"keyphrases":["sidoides extracts","respiratory complaints","frequency of respiratory cells","replication of respiratory viruses","therapeutic activity extracts","pathogenesis of respiratory tract infections","antibacterial activity","beneficial effects of","non-specific immune system","antiviral effects","EPs","traditional medical systems","long-standing medical system","non-specific immune functions","spectrum of bacteria","large population","host cells","large body of","example bronchitis","recent studies","efficacious treatment","treatment of dysentery","traditional healing practices","significant inhibition of interaction","moderate direct antibacterial capabilities","source","key","exploration of Nature","modern aqueous-ethanolic formulation of","activation","anti-infective principle","convincing evidence","health care","enzymes haemagglutinin","Southern African region","rationale","diarrhoea","disorders","compelling argument","increase of cilliary","useful herbal medicines","focus","neuraminidase","Mycobacteria strains","sinusitis","Pelargonium species","Clinical trials","investigated extract","contrast","addition","roots of","review"],"language":"en"},

Depending on the signal, the frameshifting frequency can vary over a wide range, from less than 1% to more than 50%. The present study combines experimental and bioinformatics approaches to carry out (i) a systematic analysis of the frameshift propensity of all possible motifs (16 Z_ZZN tetramers and 64 X_XXZ_ZZN heptamers) in Escherichia coli and (ii) the identification of genes potentially using this mode of expression amongst 36 Enterobacteriaceae genomes.

A good and unexploited target is the platelet collagen receptor, GPVI, which promotes thrombus formation. To identify inhibitors of GPVI that are safe and bioavailable, we docked a FDA-approved drug library into the GPVI collagen-binding site in silico. We now report that losartan and cinanserin inhibit GPVI-mediated platelet activation in a selective, competitive and dose-dependent manner. This mechanism of action likely underpins the cardioprotective effects of losartan that could not be ascribed to its antihypertensive effects.

The CEA family is divided into two groups, the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins. The CEA family members are implicated in pleiotropic (patho)physiological functions including cell\u2013cell adhesion, pregnancy, immunity, neovascularization, regulation of insulin homeostasis, and carcinogenesis. In general, the CEA-encoded proteins are composed of an extracellular region with Ig variable and constant-like domains and a cytoplasmic region containing signaling motifs. Of particular interest, the well-studied human and mouse CEA genes are arranged in clusters in a single chromosome. Taking into account this characteristic, we made an effort to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the CEA gene family. Toward this end, the publicly available genomes were searched extensively for CEA homologs. The domain organization of the retrieved protein sequences was analyzed, and, subsequently, comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the entire length CEA homologous proteins were performed. A series of evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues, functionally important, were identified. The relative positioning of these residues on the modeled tertiary structure of novel CEA protein domains revealed that they are, also, spatially conserved. Furthermore, the chromosomal arrangement of CEA genes was examined, and it was found that the CEA genes are preserved in terms of position, transcriptional orientation, and number in all species under investigation.","publish_time":"2014-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pavlopoulou, Athanasia; Scorilas, Andreas","journal":"Genome Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6c62ca4653ef469da8a131bcd9fe168e439e3a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4079198.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4079198/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CEA homologs","CEA gene family","CEA family members","mouse CEA genes","CEA-encoded proteins","chromosomal arrangement of CEA genes","entire length CEA homologous proteins","modeled tertiary structure of novel CEA protein domains","amino acid residues","carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules","vast number of glycoproteins","pregnancy-specific glycoproteins","amino acid composition","extracellular region","Ig variable","cytoplasmic region","retrieved protein sequences","neovascularization","codes","immunity","CEACAMs","physiological functions","well-studied human","regulation of insulin homeostasis","patho","comprehensive phylogenetic analyses","superfamily","terms of position","immunoglobulin","clusters","evolutionary history","groups","transcriptional orientation","domain organization","available genomes","effort","carcinogenesis","species","series","relative positioning","characteristic","single chromosome","end","investigation","motifs","account"],"language":"en"},

The present study evaluated the effects of genetic adjuvanting with Myd88 on the immune responses to a plasmid DNA rabies vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasmids encoding rabies glycoprotein alone (pIRES-Rgp) or a fragment of Myd88 gene in addition (pIRES-Rgp-Myd) were constructed and administered intramuscularly or intrademally in Swiss albino mice (on days 0, 7, and 21). Rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titres were estimated in the mice sera on days 14 and 28 by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. The protective efficacy of the constructs was evaluated by an intracerebral challenge with challenge virus standard virus on day 35. RESULTS: Co-expression of Myd88 increased RVNA responses to pIRES-Rgp by 3- and 2-folds, following intramuscular and intradermal immunization, respectively. pIRES-Rgp protected 80% of the mice following intramuscular and intradermal immunizations, while pIRES-Rgp-Myd afforded 100% protection following similar administrations.

Whilst most respiratory viruses carry IFN antagonists, reports on human metapneumovirus (HMPV) have been conflicting. Using deep sequencing, we have demonstrated that HMPV particles accumulate excessive amounts of defective interfering RNA (DIs) rapidly upon in vitro passage, and that these are associated with IFN induction. Importantly, the DIs were edited extensively; up to 70 % of the original A and T residues had mutated to G or C, respectively. Such high editing rates of viral RNA have not, to our knowledge, been reported before. Bioinformatics and PCR assays indicated that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) was the most likely editing enzyme. HMPV thus has an unusually high propensity to generate DIs, which are edited at an unprecedented high frequency. The conflicting published data on HMPV IFN induction and antagonism are probably explained by DIs in virus stocks. The interaction of HMPV DIs with the RNA-editing machinery and IFN responses warrants further investigation.","publish_time":"2014-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Hoogen, Bernadette G.; van Boheemen, Sander; de Rijck, Jonneke; van Nieuwkoop, Stefan; Smith, Derek J.; Laksono, Brigitta; Gultyaev, Alexander; Osterhaus, Albert D.

However, the mechanisms underlying the actions of GLN remain unclear, and may depend upon the route of GLN administration and the model of acute lung injury (ALI) used. The aim of this study was to investigate whether short-term GLN supplementation had an ameliorative effect on the inflammation induced by direct acid and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in mice. METHODS: Female BALB/c mice were divided into two groups, a control group and a GLN group (4.17% GLN supplementation). After a 10-day feeding period, ALI was induced by intratracheal administration of hydrochloric acid (pH 1.0; 2 mL/kg of body weight [BW]) and LPS (5 mg/kg BW). Mice were sacrificed 3 h after ALI challenge. In this early phase of ALI, serum, lungs, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the mice were collected for further analysis. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that ALI-challenged mice had a significant increase in myeloperoxidase activity and expression of interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 in the lung compared with unchallenged mice. Compared with the control group, GLN pretreatment in ALI-challenged mice reduced the levels of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and IL-1\u03B2 production in BALF, with a corresponding decrease in their mRNA expression. The GLN group also had markedly lower in mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and NADPH oxidase-1. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the benefit of dietary GLN may be partly contributed to an inhibitory effect on RAGE expression and pro-inflammatory cytokines production at an early stage in direct acid and LPS-induced ALI in mice.","publish_time":"2014-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chuang, Yin-Ching; Shaw, Huey-Mei; Chen, Chi-Chung; Pan, He-Jia; Lai, Wei-Chih; Huang, Hui-Ling","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63c89d2b2cd50114c4707577fefb8bae448c6c4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4109782.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4109782/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["GLN","NADPH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GLN group","GLN pretreatment","actions of GLN","ALI challenge","c mice","unchallenged mice","LPS-induced ALI","route of GLN administration","short-term GLN supplementation","benefit of dietary GLN","early phase of ALI","RAGE expression","IL","control group","RESULTS","direct acid","expression of interleukin","mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase","\u03B2 production","BALF","study","BW","intratracheal administration of hydrochloric acid","early stage","ameliorative effect","inhibitory effect","pro-inflammatory cytokines production","model of acute lung injury","advanced glycation end-products","lungs","serum","levels of receptor","myeloperoxidase activity","lipopolysaccharide","significant increase","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","inflammation","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","corresponding decrease","METHODS","Female BALB","groups","experimental sepsis outcomes","period","NADPH oxidase","body weight","day","BACKGROUND","Glutamine","mechanisms","aim","CONCLUSIONS","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Maternally-derived antibodies (MDAs) can decrease the transmission of pathogens between individuals by reducing shedding from infected animals and/or susceptibility of na\u00EFve animals. Only a limited number of studies, however, have been carried out to quantify the level of protection conferred by PI in terms of transmission. In the present study, an original modeling framework was designed to estimate parameters governing the transmission of infectious agents in the presence and absence of PI. This epidemiological model accounts for the distribution of PI duration and two different forces of infection depending on the serological status of animals after colostrum intake. A Bayesian approach (Metropolis-Hastings algorithm) was used for parameter estimation. The impact of PI on hepatitis E virus transmission in piglets was investigated using longitudinal serological data from six pig farms. A strong impact of PI was highlighted, the efficiency of transmission being on average 13 times lower in piglets with maternally-derived antibodies than in fully susceptible animals (range: 5\u201321). Median infection-free survival ages, based on herd-specific estimates, ranged between 8.7 and 13.8 weeks in all but one herd. Indeed, this herd exhibited a different profile with a relatively low prevalence of infected pigs (50% at slaughter age) despite the similar proportions of passively immune individuals after colostrum intake. These results suggest that the age at HEV infection is not strictly dependent upon the proportion of piglets with PI but is also linked to farm-specific husbandry (mingling of piglets after weaning) and hygiene practices. The original methodology developed here, using population-based longitudinal serological data, was able to demonstrate the relative impact of MDAs on the transmission of infectious agents.","publish_time":"2014-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andraud, Mathieu; Casas, Maribel; Pavio, Nicole; Rose, Nicolas","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d392425fe3005f145fdfa835421ff0aa5fe0104.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4140806.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140806/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["absence of PI","transmission of pathogens","strong impact of PI","efficiency of transmission","terms of transmission","transmission of infectious agents","distribution of PI duration","colostrum intake","infected animals","serological status of animals","mingling of piglets","proportion of piglets","susceptible animals","longitudinal serological data","hepatitis E virus transmission","different forces of infection","HEV infection","susceptibility of na\u00EFve animals","relative impact of MDAs","derived antibodies","herd-specific estimates","immune individuals","different profile","slaughter age","piglet protection","level of protection","original methodology","Median infection-free survival ages","original modeling framework","farm-specific husbandry","low prevalence of infected pigs","similar proportions","Metropolis-Hastings algorithm","weaning","parameters","population","presence","Bayesian approach","present study","epidemiological model accounts","pig farms","average","shedding","hygiene practices","times","parameter estimation","limited number of studies","results","range","Passive immunity","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefit of FTY720 occurs by preventing the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes thereby inhibiting the infiltration of disease-causing lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). We hypothesized that FTY720 treatment would affect lymphocyte migration to the CNS and influence disease severity in a mouse model of viral-induced neurologic disease. METHODS: Mice were infected intracranially with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Infected animals were treated with increasing doses (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) of FTY720 and morbidity and mortality recorded. Infiltration of inflammatory virus-specific T cells (tetramer staining) into the CNS of FTY720-treated mice was determined using flow cytometry. The effects of FTY720 treatment on virus-specific T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity were also determined. The severity of neuroinflammation and demyelination in FTY720-treated mice was examined by flow cytometry and histopathologically, respectively, in the spinal cords of the mice. RESULTS: Administration of FTY720 to JHMV-infected mice resulted in increased clinical disease severity and mortality. These results correlated with impaired ability to control viral replication (P \u003C 0.05) within the CNS at days 7 and 14 post-infection, which was associated with diminished accumulation of virus-specific CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells (P \u003C 0.05) into the CNS. Reduced neuroinflammation in FTY720-treated mice correlated with increased retention of T lymphocytes within draining cervical lymph nodes (P \u003C 0.05). Treatment with FTY720 did not affect virus-specific T cell proliferation, expression of IFN-\u03B3, TNF-\u03B1 or cytolytic activity. FTY720-treated mice exhibited a reduction in the severity of demyelination associated with dampened neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that FTY720 mutes effective anti-viral immune responses through impacting migration and accumulation of virus-specific T cells within the CNS during acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis. FTY720 treatment reduces the severity of neuroinflammatory-mediated demyelination by restricting the access of disease-causing lymphocytes into the CNS but is not associated with viral recrudescence in this model.","publish_time":"2014-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blanc, Caroline A; Rosen, Hugh; Lane, Thomas E","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b147a9e7654ef4257a7c45cae6606543a7864c80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4148542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4148542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Food and Drug Administration","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS of FTY720","FTY720-treated mice","Administration of FTY720","effects of FTY720 treatment","therapeutic benefit of FTY720","virus-specific T cell proliferation","severity of demyelination","severity of neuroinflammation","Infiltration of inflammatory virus-specific T cells","JHMV-infected mice","influence disease severity","FTY720 mutes effective anti-viral immune responses","increased retention of T lymphocytes","specific CD4","diminished accumulation of virus","increased clinical disease severity","mouse model of viral","viral replication","severity of neuroinflammatory","viral recrudescence","treatment of patients","infiltration of disease-causing lymphocytes","neurologic disease","egress of lymphocytes","access of disease-causing lymphocytes","acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis","neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","mediated demyelination","Drug Administration","cytolytic activity","Reduced neuroinflammation","flow cytometry","dampened neuroinflammation","Infected animals","mortality","RESULTS","human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis","impacting migration","lymphocyte migration","draining cervical lymph nodes","oral drug","expression of IFN","cytokine production","form","CD8","tetramer staining","TNF-\u03B1","central nervous system","findings","Food","reduction","impaired ability","relapsing","fingolimod","post-infection","increasing doses","days","spinal cords","Evidence","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","morbidity","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Despite the fact that bats carry and shed highly pathogenic viruses including Ebola, Nipah and SARS, they rarely display clinical symptoms of infection. Host factors influencing viral replication are poorly understood in bats and are likely to include both pre- and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. MicroRNAs are a major mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation, however very little is known about them in bats. RESULTS: This study describes 399 microRNAs identified by deep sequencing of small RNA isolated from tissues of the Black flying fox, Pteropus alecto, a confirmed natural reservoir of the human pathogens Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. Of the microRNAs identified, more than 100 are unique amongst vertebrates, including a subset containing mutations in critical seed regions. Clusters of rapidly-evolving microRNAs were identified, as well as microRNAs predicted to target genes involved in antiviral immunity, the DNA damage response, apoptosis and autophagy. Closer inspection of the predicted targets for several highly supported novel miRNA candidates suggests putative roles in host-virus interaction. CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNAs are likely to play major roles in regulating virus-host interaction in bats, via dampening of inflammatory responses (limiting the effects of immunopathology), and directly limiting the extent of viral replication, either through restricting the availability of essential factors or by controlling apoptosis. Characterisation of the bat microRNA repertoire is an essential step towards understanding transcriptional regulation during viral infection, and will assist in the identification of mechanisms that enable bats to act as natural virus reservoirs. This in turn will facilitate the development of antiviral strategies for use in humans and other species.

Perennial species are poorly adapted to fire in this system, and post\u2010fire shifts in species composition have been substantial but variable across community types. To generalize across a range of conditions, we investigated whether simple life\u2010history traits could predict how species responded to fire. Further, we classified species into plant functional types (PFTs) based on combinations of life\u2010history traits and evaluated whether these groups exhibited a consistent fire\u2010response. Six life\u2010history traits varied significantly between burned and unburned areas in short (up to 4 years) or long\u2010term (up to 52 years) post\u2010fire datasets, including growth form, lifespan, seed size, seed dispersal, height, and leaf longevity. Forbs and grasses consistently increased in abundance after fire, while cacti were reduced and woody species exhibited a variable response. Woody species were classified into three PFTs based on combinations of life\u2010history traits. Species in Group 1 increased in abundance after fire and were characterized by short lifespans, small, wind\u2010dispersed seeds, low height, and deciduous leaves. Species in Group 2 were reduced by fire and distinguished from Group 1 by longer lifespans and evergreen leaves. Group 3 species, which also decreased after fire, were characterized by long lifespans, large non\u2010wind dispersed seeds, and taller heights. Our results show that PFTs based on life\u2010history traits can reliably predict the responses of most species to fire in the Mojave Desert.

The isothermal RPA was applied to amplify specific target sequences from the pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using genomic DNA. Additionally, a positive plasmid control was established as an internal control. The four targets were amplified simultaneously in a quadruplex reaction. The amplicon is labeled during on-chip RPA by reverse oligonucleotide primers coupled to a fluorophore. Both amplification and spatially resolved signal generation take place on immobilized forward primers bount to expoxy-silanized glass surfaces in a pump-driven hybridization chamber. The combination of microarray technology and sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 38 \u00B0C allows for a multiparameter analysis on a rather small area. The on-chip RPA was characterized in terms of reaction time, sensitivity and inhibitory conditions. A successful enzymatic reaction is completed in \u003C20 min and results in detection limits of 10 colony-forming units for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica and 100 colony-forming units for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

They not only specialize in the production of ribosomal subunits but also play roles in many fundamental cellular activities. Concerning ribosome biosynthesis, particular stages of this process, i.e., ribosomal DNA transcription, primary RNA transcript processing, and ribosome assembly proceed in precisely defined nucleolar subdomains. Although eukaryotic nucleoli are conservative in respect of their main function, clear morphological differences between these structures can be noticed between individual kingdoms. In most cases, a plant nucleolus shows well-ordered structure in which four main ultrastructural components can be distinguished: fibrillar centers, dense fibrillar component, granular component, and nucleolar vacuoles. Nucleolar chromatin is an additional crucial structural component of this organelle. Nucleolonema, although it is not always an unequivocally distinguished nucleolar domain, has often been described as a well-grounded morphological element, especially of plant nucleoli. The ratios and morphology of particular subcompartments of a nucleolus can change depending on its metabolic activity which in turn is correlated with the physiological state of a cell, cell type, cell cycle phase, as well as with environmental influence. Precise attribution of functions to particular nucleolar subregions in the process of ribosome biosynthesis is now possible using various approaches. The presented description of plant nucleolar morphology summarizes previous knowledge regarding the function of nucleoli as well as of their particular subdomains not only in the course of ribosome biosynthesis.","publish_time":"2014-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"St\u0119pi\u0144ski, Dariusz","journal":"Protoplasma","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1f1806e2d4561bb8cd2f4025586b9b6278e5a72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4209244.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nucleoli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["particular nucleolar subregions","Nucleolar chromatin","nucleolar vacuoles","plant nucleoli","process of ribosome biosynthesis","defined nucleolar subdomains","function of nucleoli","particular subdomains","distinguished nucleolar domain","eukaryotic nucleoli","course of ribosome biosynthesis","presented description of plant nucleolar morphology","ribosome assembly","plant nucleolus","particular stages","morphology of particular subcompartments","granular component","cell type","dense fibrillar component","main function","cell cycle phase","fibrillar centers","additional crucial structural component","eukaryotic cells","ribosomal DNA transcription","main ultrastructural components","clear morphological differences","well-grounded morphological element","production of ribosomal subunits","primary RNA transcript processing","previous knowledge","well-ordered structure","respect","roles","structures","nuclear domains present","Precise attribution of functions","physiological state","turn","organelle","various approaches","fundamental cellular activities","cases","ratios","metabolic activity","individual kingdoms","environmental influence","Nucleolonema"],"language":"en"},

We used diverse techniques, including fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cryoelectron tomography, immunolabeling and biochemical methodologies to investigate the role of autophagy in host\u2013virus interactions. Hallmarks of autophagy are induced during the lytic phase of E. huxleyi viral infection, concomitant with up-regulation of autophagy-related genes (ATG genes). Pretreatment of the infected cells with an autophagy inhibitor causes a major reduction in the production of extracellular viral particles, without reducing viral DNA replication within the cell. The host-encoded Atg8 protein was detected within purified virions, demonstrating the pivotal role of the autophagy-like process in viral assembly and egress. We show that autophagy, which is classically considered as a defense mechanism, is essential for viral propagation and for facilitating a high burst size.

Prenatal care could be a very good opportunity for TB care, especially for women who have limited access to health services. The aim of this review was to gather and evaluate studies on TB care for pregnant women. METHODS: We used a combination of the terms \u201Ctuberculosis\u201D and \u201Cpregnancy\u201D, limited to human, to search for published articles. Studies reflecting original data and focusing on TB care for pregnant women were included. All references retrieved were collected using the Reference Manager software (Version 11). RESULTS: Thirty five studies were selected for review and their data showed that diagnosis was often delayed because TB symptoms during pregnancy were not typical. TB prophylaxis and anti-TB therapy appeared to be safe and effective for pregnant women and their babies when suitable follow up and early initiation were present, but the compliance rate to TB prophylaxis is still low due to lack of follow up and referral services. TB care practices in the reviewed studies were in line in principle with the WHO International Standards for Tuberculosis Care (ISTC). CONCLUSIONS: Integration of TB care within prenatal care would improve TB diagnosis and treatment for pregnant women. To improve the quality of TB care, it is necessary to develop national level guidelines based on the ISTC with detailed guidelines for pregnant women.

Hepcidin is a \u03B2-defensin-like antimicrobial peptide and acts as a principal iron regulatory hormone. Hepcidin is mostly produced by hepatocytes, but is also expressed by other cells, such as airway epithelial cells. However, nothing is known about its function in lung infections and inflammatory diseases. We therefore sought to investigate the role of airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin in sepsis-induced acute lung injury. METHODS: Acute lung injury was induced by polymicrobial sepsis via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery. Adenovirus-mediated short hairpin RNA specific for the mouse hepcidin gene hepc1 and control adenovirus were intratracheally injected into mice. The adenovirus-mediated knockdown of hepcidin in airway epithelial cells was evaluated in vivo. Lung injury and the seven-day survival rate were assessed. The levels of hepcidin-related iron export protein ferroportin were measured, and the iron content and function of alveolar macrophages were evaluated. RESULTS: The hepcidin level in airway epithelial cells was upregulated during polymicrobial sepsis. The knockdown of airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin aggravated the polymicrobial sepsis-induced lung injury and pulmonary bacterial infection and increased mortality (53.33% in Ad-shHepc1-treated mice versus 12.5% in Ad-shNeg-treated mice, P \u003C0.05). The knockdown of hepcidin in airway epithelial cells also led to reduced ferroportin degradation and a low intracellular iron content in alveolar macrophages. Moreover, alveolar macrophages form the airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin knockdown mice showed impaired phagocytic ability than those from the control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin plays an important role in CLP-induced acute lung injury. The severe lung injury in the airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin knockdown mice is at least partially related to the altered intracellular iron level and function of alveolar macrophages.","publish_time":"2014-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Qi Xing; Song, Sheng Wen; Chen, Qing Hua; Zeng, Cong Li; Zheng, Xia; Wang, Jun Lu; Fang, Xiang Ming","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d725cbad904550149fb46b71ec99629edbed74ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4243715.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243715/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airway epithelial cells","knockdown of airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin","airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin knockdown mice","role of airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin","hepcidin level","levels of hepcidin","adenovirus-mediated knockdown of hepcidin","acute lung injury","polymicrobial sepsis-induced lung injury","severe lung injury","lung infections","control mice","treated mice","mouse hepcidin gene hepc1","function of alveolar macrophages","low intracellular iron content","altered intracellular iron level","control adenovirus","related iron export protein ferroportin","pulmonary infection","important role","principal iron regulatory hormone","CLP","pulmonary bacterial infection","important component","Ad-shNeg","Ad-shHepc1","reduced ferroportin degradation","production of antimicrobial peptides","acts","innate immune response","short hairpin RNA specific","impaired phagocytic ability","puncture","increased mortality","cecal ligation","\u03B2-defensin","inflammation","inflammatory diseases","CONCLUSIONS","surgery","INTRODUCTION","day survival rate","METHODS","RESULTS","hepatocytes"],"language":"en"},

It has been reported that miRNAs are involved in host-virus interaction, but evidence that cellular miRNAs promote virus replication has been limited. Here, we found that miR-23a promoted the replication of human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in HeLa cells, as demonstrated by a plaque-formation assay and quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), an innate antiviral molecule, is targeted by miR-23a to facilitate viral replication. MiR-23a binds to the 3\u2032UTR of IRF1 and down-regulates its expression. Suppression of IRF1 expression reduced RSAD2 gene expression, augmenting HSV-1 replication. Ectopic expression of IRF1 abrogated the promotion of HSV-1 replication induced by miR-23a. Notably, IRF1 contributes to innate antiviral immunity by binding to IRF-response elements to regulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and apoptosis, revealing a complex interaction between miR-23a and HSV-1. MiR-23a thus contributes to HSV-1 replication through the regulation of the IRF1-mediated antiviral signal pathway, which suggests that miR-23a may represent a promising target for antiviral treatments.","publish_time":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ru, Jing; Sun, Huahui; Fan, Hongxia; Wang, Chunmei; Li, Yixuan; Liu, Min; Tang, Hua","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1bceb4ec14b80d88dd6375165847aa049588738.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4252059.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4252059/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus replication","Suppression of IRF1 expression","Ectopic expression of IRF1","expression of interferon","UTR of IRF1","viral replication","RSAD2 gene expression","promotion of HSV","antiviral immunity","antiviral treatments","innate antiviral molecule","replication of human herpes simplex virus type","host-virus interaction","cellular miRNAs","antiviral signal pathway","complex interaction","interferon regulatory factor","evidence","non-coding RNAs","plaque-formation assay","apoptosis","binding","IRF-response elements","stimulated genes","quantitative real-time PCR","ISGs","regulation","promising target","HeLa cells","MicroRNAs","binds"],"language":"en"},

Measuring adverse events is necessary for quality improvement, but current detection methods are inaccurate, untimely and expensive. The advent of electronic health records and the development of automated methods for encoding and classifying electronic narrative data, such as natural language processing, offer an opportunity to identify potentially better methods. The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of using automated methods for detecting three highly prevalent adverse events: a) hospital-acquired pneumonia, b) catheter-associated bloodstream infections, and c) in-hospital falls. METHODS/DESIGN: This validation study will be conducted at two large Canadian academic health centres: the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) and The Ottawa Hospital (TOH). The study population consists of all medical, surgical and intensive care unit patients admitted to these centres between 2008 and 2014. An automated detection algorithm will be developed and validated for each of the three adverse events using electronic data extracted from multiple clinical databases. A random sample of MUHC patients will be used to develop the automated detection algorithms (cohort 1, development set). The accuracy of these algorithms will be assessed using chart review as the reference standard. Then, receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to identify optimal cut points for each of the data sources. Multivariate logistic regression and the areas under curve (AUC) will be used to identify the optimal combination of data sources that maximize the accuracy of adverse event detection. The most accurate algorithms will then be validated on a second random sample of MUHC patients (cohort 1, validation set), and accuracy will be measured using chart review as the reference standard. The most accurate algorithms validated at the MUHC will then be applied to TOH data (cohort 2), and their accuracy will be assessed using a reference standard assessment of the medical chart. DISCUSSION: There is a need for more accurate, timely and efficient measures of adverse events in acute care hospitals. This is a critical requirement for evaluating the effectiveness of preventive interventions and for tracking progress in patient safety through time.","publish_time":"2015-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rochefort, Christian M; Buckeridge, David L; Forster, Alan J","journal":"Implement Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc589336315df8e93a0fcd4fda5442bf982e9b6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4296680.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296680/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["McGill University Health Centre","MUHC","TOH"],"locations":["The Ottawa Hospital"],"keyphrases":["prevalent adverse events","electronic data","accuracy of adverse event detection","automated detection algorithms","development of automated methods","TOH data","accurate algorithms","current detection methods","efficient measures of adverse events","cohort","electronic narrative data","random sample of MUHC patients","better methods","medical chart","hospitalized patients","chart review","optimal combination of data sources","validation study","reference standard assessment","advent of electronic health records","intensive care unit patients","development set","validation set","Ottawa Hospital","hospital falls","study population","large Canadian academic health centres","McGill University Health Centre","acute care hospitals","optimal cut points","catheter-associated bloodstream infections","quality improvement","tracking progress","significant morbidity","areas","effectiveness of preventive interventions","mortality","cost","opportunity","natural language processing","patient safety","multiple clinical databases","time","pneumonia","Multivariate logistic regression","need","DESIGN","critical requirement","characteristic curves","receiver","AUC","BACKGROUND","DISCUSSION","objective"],"language":"en"},

However, genome size in RNA viruses is likely limited by a high mutation rate, resulting in the evolution of various mechanisms to increase complexity while minimising genome expansion. Here we conduct a large-scale analysis of the genome sequences of 99 animal rhabdoviruses, including 45 genomes which we determined de novo, to identify patterns of genome expansion and the evolution of genome complexity. All but seven of the rhabdoviruses clustered into 17 well-supported monophyletic groups, of which eight corresponded to established genera, seven were assigned as new genera, and two were taxonomically ambiguous. We show that the acquisition and loss of new genes appears to have been a central theme of rhabdovirus evolution, and has been associated with the appearance of alternative, overlapping and consecutive ORFs within the major structural protein genes, and the insertion and loss of additional ORFs in each gene junction in a clade-specific manner. Changes in the lengths of gene junctions accounted for as much as 48.5% of the variation in genome size from the smallest to the largest genome, and the frequency with which new ORFs were observed increased in the 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 direction along the genome. We also identify several new families of accessory genes encoded in these regions, and show that non-canonical expression strategies involving TURBS-like termination-reinitiation, ribosomal frame-shifts and leaky ribosomal scanning appear to be common. We conclude that rhabdoviruses have an unusual capacity for genomic plasticity that may be linked to their discontinuous transcription strategy from the negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, and propose a model that accounts for the regular occurrence of genome expansion and contraction throughout the evolution of the Rhabdoviridae.","publish_time":"2015-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker, Peter J.; Firth, Cadhla; Widen, Steven G.; Blasdell, Kim R.; Guzman, Hilda; Wood, Thomas G.; Paradkar, Prasad N.; Holmes, Edward C.; Tesh, Robert B.; Vasilakis, Nikos","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/997f6355fdf8531d31a8bdadd1067f651e2e3d41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4334499.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome size","genome sequences","largest genome","evolution of genome complexity","minimising genome expansion","patterns of genome expansion","regular occurrence of genome expansion","new ORFs","loss of new genes","new genera","negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome","RNA viruses","new families of accessory genes","consecutive ORFs","loss of additional ORFs","evolution of various mechanisms","animal rhabdoviruses","major structural protein genes","central theme of rhabdovirus evolution","ribosomal frame","genomic diversity","genomic plasticity","leaky ribosomal scanning","lengths of gene junctions","TURBS","insertion","contraction","non-canonical expression strategies","termination-reinitiation","smallest","well-supported monophyletic groups","discontinuous transcription strategy","regions","unusual capacity","model","frequency","clade-specific manner","Changes","genomes","high mutation rate","novo","large-scale analysis","variation","acquisition","appearance of alternative","Rhabdoviridae","direction"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to assess the efficacy of corticosteroids treatment for H1N1 infection. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis were used to estimate the efficacy of corticosteroids for the prevention of mortality in H1N1 infection. Databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials and so on, and bibliographies of retrieved articles, from April 2009 to October 2014. We included both cohort studies and case-control studies reported in English or Chinese that compared treatment effects between corticosteroids and non-corticosteroids therapy in inpatients with H1N1 virus infection. Cohort studies employed mortality as outcome, and case-control studies employed deaths as cases and survivors as controls; both were assessed in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: In total twenty-three eligible studies were included. Both cohort studies (nine studies, n = 1,405) and case-control studies (14 studies, n = 4,700) showed a similar trend toward increased mortality (cohort studies relative risk was 1.85 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46 to 2.33; case-control studies odds ratio was 4.22 with 95% CI 3.10 to 5.76). The results from both subgroup analyses and sensitive analyses were consistent with each other, showing that steroid treatment is associated with mortality. However, considering the fact that corticosteroids were tend to be used in sickest case-patients and heterogeneity was observed between studies, we cannot make a solid conclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence did not support the use of corticosteroids as standard care for patients with severe influenza. We conclude that further research is required.

Two epidemic waves of Human H7N9 infections have taken place in Eastern and South Central China during the years of 2013 and 2014. In this study, we report on the first four human cases of influenza H7N9 in Shantou, Guangdong province, which occurred during the second H7N9 wave, and the subsequent analysis of the viral isolates. METHODS: Viral genomes were subjected to multisegment amplification and sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq. Later, phylogenetic analyses of influenza H7N9 viruses were performed to establish the evolutionary context of the disease in humans. RESULTS: The sequences of the isolates from Shantou have closer evolutionary proximity to the predominant Eastern H7N9 cluster (similar to A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9)) than to the Southern H7N9 cluster (similar to A/Guangdong/1/2013 (H7N9)). CONCLUSIONS: Two distinct phylogenetic groups of influenza H7N9 circulate currently in China and cause infections in humans as a consequence of cross-species spillover from the avian disease. The Eastern cluster, which includes the four isolates from Shantou, presents a wide geographic distribution and overlaps with the more restricted area of circulation of the Southern cluster. Continued monitoring of the avian disease is of critical importance to better understand and predict the epidemiological behaviour of the human cases.

The renal response to persistent leptospiral colonization, as measured by urinary protein biosignatures, has not been systematically studied. Urinary exosomes--bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles--contain cell-state specific cargo that additively reflect formation all along the nephron. We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exosome protein content from 24 hour urine samples of Leptospira-infected rats was compared with that of uninfected rats using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical models were used to identify significantly dysregulated proteins in Leptospira-infected and uninfected rat urine exosomes. In all, 842 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS proteomics of total rat urine and 204 proteins associated specifically with exosomes. Multivariate analysis showed that 25 proteins significantly discriminated between uninfected control and infected rats. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also known as CD13 topped this list with the highest score, a finding we validated by Western immunoblotting. Whole urine analysis showed Tamm-Horsfall protein level reduction in the infected rat urine. Total urine and exosome proteins were significantly different in male vs. female infected rats. CONCLUSIONS: We identified exosome-associated renal tubule-specific responses to Leptospira infection in a rat chronic colonization model. Quantitative differences in infected male and female rat urine exosome proteins vs. uninfected controls suggest that urine exosome analysis identifies important differences in kidney function that may be of clinical and pathological significance.","publish_time":"2015-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"RamachandraRao, Satish P.; Matthias, Michael A.; Mondrogon, Chanthel-Kokoy; Aghania, Eamon; Park, Cathleen; Kong, Casey; Ishaya, Michelle; Madrigal, Assael; Horng, Jennifer; Khoshaba, Roni; Bounkhoun, Anousone; Basilico, Fabrizio; De Palma, Antonella; Agresta, Anna Maria; Awdishu, Linda; Naviaux, Robert K.; Vinetz, Joseph M.; Mauri, Pierluigi","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e64a2ab805fe19fae40eb382eccb7ea82a997a1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4368819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4368819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Infectious Leptospira"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["urine analysis","Leptospira-infected","urine exosome analysis","Total urine","uninfected rat urine exosomes","female rat urine exosome proteins","content of urine exosomes","uninfected rats","female infected rats","hour urine samples of Leptospira","MS proteomics of total rat urine","infected male","Leptospira-infection","Leptospira infection","Infectious Leptospira","dysregulated proteins","Exosome protein content","LC-MS","Urinary exosomes","Leptospira-induced alterations","uninfected controls","rat chronic colonization model","urinary protein biosignatures","Multivariate analysis","important differences","renal tubule-specific responses","Quantitative differences","renal response","Tamm-Horsfall protein level reduction","persistent leptospiral colonization","cell-state specific cargo","bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles","liquid chromatography","tandem mass spectrometry","SDS-PAGE","kidney function","novel pathways","clues","kidneys of reservoir","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","formation","METHODOLOGY","bacterial-host interactions","highest score","accidental hosts","list","CD13","aminopeptidase","BACKGROUND","Western immunoblotting","pathological significance","humans","Alanyl","Statistical models","nephron","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus and the secretory vesicles, expand not only the membrane components but also the protein machinery required for increased protein production and transport. Increased protein load causes an ER stress response akin to the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Recent work has implicated several bZip transcription factors in the regulation of protein components of the early secretory pathway necessary to alleviate this stress. Here, we highlight eight bZip transcription factors in regulating secretory pathway component genes. These include components of the three canonical branches of the UPR-ATF4, XBP1, and ATF6, as well as the five members of the Creb3 family of transcription factors.We review findings from both invertebrate and vertebrate model systems suggesting that all of these proteins increase secretory capacity in response to increased protein load. Finally, we propose that the Creb3 family of factors may have a dual role in secretory cell differentiation by also regulating the pathways necessary for cell cycle exit during terminal differentiation.

Degradation of Dicer protein is facilitated during vaccinia virus (VV) infection. A C-terminal cleaved product of Dicer protein was detected in the presence of MG132 during VV infection. Thus, it is possible that Dicer protein is cleaved by a viral protease followed by proteasome degradation of the cleaved product. There is a potential I7 protease cleavage site in the C-terminus of Dicer protein. Indeed, reduction of Dicer protein was detected when Dicer was co-expressed with I7 protease but not with an I7 protease mutant protein lack of the protease activity. Mutation of the potential I7 cleavage site in the C-terminus of Dicer protein resisted its degradation during VV infection. Furthermore, Dicer protein was reduced dramatically by recombinant VV vI7Li after the induction of I7 protease. If VV could facilitate the degradation of Dicer protein, the process of miRNA should be affected by VV infection. Indeed, accumulation of precursor miR122 was detected after VV infection or I7 protease expression. Reduction of miR122 would result in the suppression of HCV sub-genomic RNA replication, and, in turn, the amount of viral proteins. As expected, significant reduction of HCVNS5A protein was detected after VV infection and I7 protease expression. Therefore, our results suggest that VV could cleave Dicer protein through I7 protease to facilitate Dicer degradation, and in turn, suppress the processing of miRNAs. Effect of Dicer protein on VV replication was also studied. Exogenous expression of Dicer protein suppresses VV replication slightly while knockdown of Dicer protein does not affect VV replication significantly.","publish_time":"2015-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jhih-Si; Li, Hui-Chun; Lin, Shu-I; Yang, Chee-Hing; Chien, Wan-Yu; Syu, Ciao-Ling; Lo, Shih-Yen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3faebf3f78e4b42abd134372119fde0ed298fa4b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4376780.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4376780/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dicer"],"organizations":["VV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Degradation of Dicer protein","reduction of Dicer protein","knockdown of Dicer protein","Effect of Dicer protein","Dicer degradation","VV infection","Exogenous expression of Dicer protein","VV replication","I7 protease expression","I7 protease mutant protein lack","C-terminal cleaved product of Dicer protein","induction of I7 protease","viral protease","protease activity","significant reduction of HCVNS5A protein","recombinant VV vI7Li","potential I7 protease cleavage site","potential I7 cleavage site","proteasome degradation","C-terminus","Reduction of miR122","turn","suppression of HCV sub-genomic RNA replication","process of miRNA","miRNA pathway","viral proteins","accumulation of precursor miR122","vaccinia virus","key component","Mutation","presence of MG132","processing of miRNAs","results"],"language":"en"},

To assess whether these procedures are performed, a valid set of quality indicators (QIs) is required. The goal of this study was to select a set of key recommendations that can be systematically translated into QIs to measure the quality of infectious disease outbreak response from the perspective of disaster emergency responders and infectious disease control professionals. METHODS: Applying the Rand modified Delphi procedure, the following steps were taken to systematically select a set of key recommendations: extraction of recommendations from relevant literature; appraisal of the recommendations in terms of relevance through questionnaires to experts; expert meeting to discuss recommendations; prioritization of recommendations through a second questionnaire; and final expert meeting to approve the selected set. Infectious disease physicians and nurses, policymakers and communication experts participated in the expert group (n = 48). RESULTS: In total, 54 national and international publications were systematically searched for recommendations, yielding over 200 recommendations. The Rand modified Delphi procedure resulted in a set of 65 key recommendations. The key recommendations were categorized into 10 domains describing the whole response pathway from outbreak recognition to aftercare. CONCLUSION: This study provides a set of key recommendations that represents \u2018good quality of response to an infectious disease outbreak\u2019. These key recommendations can be systematically translated into QIs.

However, which pathogens are related to asthma exacerbation in adults remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The relation between various infections and adult asthma exacerbations was investigated in clinical practice. METHODS: The study subjects included 50 adult inpatients due to asthma exacerbations and 20 stable outpatients for comparison. The pathogens from a nasopharyngeal swab were measured by multiplex PCR analysis. RESULTS: Asthma exacerbations occurred after a common cold in 48 inpatients. The numbers of patients with viral, bacterial, or both infections were 16, 9, and 9, respectively. The dominant viruses were rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and metapneumovirus. The major bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Compared to pathogen-free patients, the patients with pathogens were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, lower IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had a higher incidence of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 50% of stable outpatients, but a higher incidence of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus infections was observed in asthma exacerbation inpatients. H. influenzae was observed in stable asthmatic patients. Other bacteria, especially S. pneumoniae, were important in asthma exacerbation inpatients. CONCLUSION: Viral or bacterial infections were observed in 70% of inpatients with an asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Infection with S. pneumoniae was related to adult asthma exacerbation.","publish_time":"2015-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iikura, Motoyasu; Hojo, Masayuki; Koketsu, Rikiya; Watanabe, Sho; Sato, Ayano; Chino, Haruka; Ro, Shoki; Masaki, Haruna; Hirashima, Junko; Ishii, Satoru; Naka, Go; Takasaki, Jin; Izumi, Shinyu; Kobayashi, Nobuyuki; Yamaguchi, Sachiko; Nakae, Susumu; Sugiyama, Haruhito","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1edf39ded74b76134cc304dd347a4eb20bae012.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4406689.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4406689/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma exacerbation inpatients","adult asthma exacerbations","adult inpatients","stable outpatients","metapneumovirus infections","bacterial infections","stable asthmatic patients","pneumoniae","pathogens","higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis","various infections","numbers of patients","Viral infection","respiratory syncytial virus","higher incidence of smoking","higher incidence of rhinovirus","influenza virus","COPD","pathogen-free patients","clinical practice","influenzae","dominant viruses","major bacteria","lower FeNO levels","lower IgE titers","later onset of disease","rhinoviruses","relation","nasopharyngeal swab","risk factors","study subjects","multiplex PCR analysis","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","comparison","adults","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Reflecting their importance for host defense, pathogens encode various countermeasures to evade or inhibit these immune effectors. PRRs directly engaged by pathogen inhibitors often evolve under recurrent bouts of positive selection that have been described as molecular \u2018arms races.\u2019 Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) was recently identified as a key PRR. Upon binding cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from various viruses, cGAS generates the small nucleotide secondary messenger cGAMP to signal activation of innate defenses. Here we report an evolutionary history of cGAS with recurrent positive selection in the primate lineage. Recent studies indicate a high degree of structural similarity between cGAS and 2\u2019-5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), a PRR that detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), despite low sequence identity between the respective genes. We present comprehensive comparative evolutionary analysis of cGAS and OAS1 primate sequences and observe positive selection at nucleic acid binding interfaces and distributed throughout both genes. Our data revealed homologous regions with strong signatures of positive selection, suggesting common mechanisms employed by unknown pathogen encoded inhibitors and similar modes of evasion from antagonism. Our analysis of cGAS diversification also identified alternately spliced forms missing multiple sites under positive selection. Further analysis of selection on the OAS family in primates, which comprises OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and OASL, suggests a hypothesis where gene duplications and domain fusion events result in paralogs that provide another means of escaping pathogen inhibitors. Together our comparative evolutionary analysis of cGAS and OAS provides new insights into distinct mechanisms by which key molecular sentinels of the innate immune system have adapted to circumvent viral-encoded inhibitors.","publish_time":"2015-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hancks, Dustin C.; Hartley, Melissa K.; Hagan, Celia; Clark, Nathan L.; Elde, Nels C.","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb0d926b1fa6dc7d9f86a001f8ccd69407c5ed86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4420275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of selection","recurrent positive selection","analysis of cGAS diversification","evolutionary history of cGAS","recurrent bouts of positive selection","comprehensive comparative evolutionary analysis of cGAS","strong signatures of positive selection","unknown pathogen","means of escaping pathogen inhibitors","innate immune system","viral-encoded inhibitors","crucial innate immune responses","OAS1 primate sequences","immune effectors","PRRs","key PRR","activation of innate defenses","key molecular sentinels","double-stranded RNA","binding cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA","distinct mechanisms","common mechanisms","nucleic acids","OAS family","nucleic acid binding interfaces","various viruses","host defense","various countermeasures","host organisms","primate lineage","respective genes","oligoadenylate synthase","Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase","dsDNA","small nucleotide secondary messenger cGAMP","spliced forms","hypothesis","dsRNA","new insights","domain fusion events","gene duplications","homologous regions","low sequence identity","similar modes of evasion","high degree of structural similarity","diverse subset of pattern recognition receptors","paralogs","OASL","pathogens","multiple sites","primates","data","OAS3","OAS2","Recent studies","antagonism","importance","arms races"],"language":"en"},

These peptides experienced liberation by the proteasome and transport by the peptide transporter TAP. However, there are multiple roads that lead to Rome, illustrated by the increasing number of alternative processing pathways that have been reported during last years. Interestingly, TAP-deficient individuals do not succumb to viral infections, suggesting that CD8 T cell immunity is sufficiently supported by alternative TAP-independent processing pathways. To date, a diversity of viral and endogenous TAP-independent peptides have been identified in the grooves of different MHC class I alleles. Some of these peptides are not displayed by normal TAP-positive cells and we therefore called them TEIPP, for \u201CT-cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing.\u201D TEIPPs are hidden self-antigens, are derived from normal housekeeping proteins, and are processed via unconventional processing pathways. Per definition, TEIPPs are presented via TAP-independent pathways, but recent data suggest that part of this repertoire still depend on proteasome and metalloprotease activity. An exception is the C-terminal peptide of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane-spanning ceramide synthase Trh4 that is surprisingly liberated by the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), the proteolytic enzyme involved in cleaving leader sequences. The intramembrane cleaving SPP is thereby an important contributor of TAP-independent peptides. Its family members, like the Alzheimer\u2019s related presenilins, might contribute as well, according to our preliminary data. Finally, alternative peptide routing is an emerging field and includes processes like the unfolded protein response, the ER-associated degradation, and autophagy-associated vesicular pathways. These data convince us that there is a world to be discovered in the field of unconventional antigen processing.","publish_time":"2015-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oliveira, Cl\u00E1udia C.; van Hall, Thorbald","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/138200f99f62c51776c9afec55d856e854ea8ff1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4457021.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4457021/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","SPP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TAP-independent pathways","alternative TAP-independent processing pathways","peptide transporter TAP","unconventional processing pathways","endogenous TAP-independent peptides","impaired peptide processing","increasing number of alternative processing pathways","important contributor of TAP","alternative peptide routing","TAP-deficient individuals","field of unconventional antigen processing","vesicular pathways","normal TAP-positive cells","conventional antigen-processing pathway","C-terminal peptide","signal peptide peptidase","peptides experienced liberation","T-cell epitopes","proteasome","cell surface","ER-associated degradation","TEIPPs","recent data","preliminary data","CD8 T cell immunity","intramembrane cleaving SPP","viral infections","diversity of viral","emerging field","grooves of different MHC class","cleaving leader sequences","normal housekeeping proteins","proteolytic enzyme","endoplasmic reticulum","unfolded protein response","processes","autophagy","Rome","alleles","molecules","Alzheimer\u2019s related presenilins","family members","self-antigens","ceramide synthase Trh4","exception","repertoire","metalloprotease activity","multiple roads","date","definition","world","years"],"language":"en"},

We herein aimed to determine the modalities of death in septic shock. METHODS: This was a 6-year (2008\u20132013) monocenter retrospective study. All consecutive patients diagnosed for septic shock within the first 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included. Early and late deaths were defined as occurring within or after 3 days following ICU admission, respectively. The main cause of death in the ICU was determined from medical files. A multinomial logistic regression analysis using the status alive as the reference category was performed to identify the prognostic factors associated with early and late deaths. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-three patients were included, with a mean age of 66 \u00B1 15 years and a high proportion (67 %) of comorbidities. The in-ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were 37.2 and 45 %, respectively. Deaths occurred early for 78 (32 %) and later on for 166 (68 %) patients in the ICU (n = 124) or in the hospital (n = 42). Early deaths were mainly attributable to intractable multiple organ failure related to the primary infection (82 %) and to mesenteric ischemia (6.4 %). In-ICU late deaths were directly related to end-of-life decisions in 29 % of patients and otherwise mostly related to ICU-acquired complications, including nosocomial infections (20.4 %) and mesenteric ischemia (16.6 %). Independent determinants of early death were age, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, no pathogen identification, and initial severity. Among 3-day survivors, independent risk factors for late death were age, cirrhosis, no pathogen identification, and previous corticosteroid treatment.

That is, to play more significant roles in disaster risk reduction (DRR). Preparedness efforts focus on changing human behaviors in ways that reduce people\u2019s risk and increase their ability to cope with hazard consequences. While preparedness initiatives have used behavioral theories to facilitate DRR, many theories have been used and little is known about which behavioral theories are more commonly used, where they have been used, and why they have been preferred over alternative behavioral theories. Given that theories differ with respect to the variables used and the relationship between them, a systematic analysis is an essential first step to answering questions about the relative utility of theories and providing a more robust evidence base for preparedness components of DRR strategies. The goal of this systematic review was to search and summarize evidence by assessing the application of behavioral theories to disaster and emergency health preparedness across the world. Methods: The protocol was prepared in which the study objectives, questions, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and sensitive search strategies were developed and pilot-tested at the beginning of the study. Using selected keywords, articles were searched mainly in PubMed, Scopus, Mosby\u2019s Index (Nursing Index) and Safetylit databases. Articles were assessed based on their titles, abstracts, and their full texts. The data were extracted from selected articles and results were presented using qualitative and quantitative methods. Results: In total, 2040 titles, 450 abstracts and 62 full texts of articles were assessed for eligibility criteria, whilst five articles were archived from other sources, and then finally, 33 articles were selected. The Health Belief Model (HBM), Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Social Cognitive Theories were most commonly applied to influenza (H1N1 and H5N1), floods, and earthquake hazards. Studies were predominantly conducted in USA (13 studies). In Asia, where the annual number of disasters and victims exceeds those in other continents, only three studies were identified. Overall, the main constructs of HBM (perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers), EPPM (higher threat and higher efficacy), TPB (attitude and subjective norm), and the majority of the constructs utilized in Social Cognitive Theories were associated with preparedness for diverse hazards. However, while all the theories described above describe the relationships between constituent variables, with the exception of research on Social Cognitive Theories, few studies of other theories and models used path analysis to identify the interdependence relationships between the constructs described in the respective theories/models. Similarly, few identified how other mediating variables could influence disaster and emergency preparedness. Conclusions: The existing evidence on the application of behavioral theories and models to disaster and emergency preparedness is chiefly from developed countries. This raises issues regarding their utility in countries, particularly in Asisa and the Middle East, where cultural characteristics are very different to those prevailing in the Western countries in which theories have been developed and tested. The theories and models discussed here have been applied predominantly to disease outbreaks and natural hazards, and information on their utility as guides to preparedness for man-made hazards is lacking.

Intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida induced highly increased levels of cytokine mRNAs during a 72-hour postinfection (hpi) period. In contrast, only the fish-specific tlr22a2 and the downstream factor irak1 featured clearly increased transcript levels, while the mRNA concentrations of many other tlr genes decreased. Flow cytometry quantified cell trafficking after infection indicating a dramatic influx of myeloid cells into the peritoneum and a belated low level immigration of lymphoid cells. T and B lymphocytes were differentiated with RT-qPCR revealing that B lymphocytes emigrated from and T lymphocytes immigrated into head kidney.

METHODS: Adult male Akita transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing specifically hnRNP F in their renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs) were studied. Non-Akita littermates and Akita mice served as controls. Immortalised rat RPTCs stably transfected with plasmid containing either rat Hnrnpf cDNA or rat Ace-2 gene promoter were also studied. RESULTS: Overexpression of hnRNP F attenuated systemic hypertension, glomerular filtration rate, albumin/creatinine ratio, urinary angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin (Ang) II levels, renal fibrosis and profibrotic gene (Agt, Tgf-\u03B21, TGF-\u03B2 receptor II [Tgf-\u03B2rII]) expression, stimulated anti-profibrotic gene (Ace-2 and Ang 1\u20137 receptor [MasR]) expression, and normalised urinary Ang 1\u20137 level in Akita Hnrnpf-Tg mice as compared with Akita mice. In vitro, hnRNP F overexpression stimulated Ace-2 gene promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression, and attenuated Agt, Tgf-\u03B21 and Tgf-\u03B2rII gene expression. Furthermore, hnRNP F overexpression prevented TGF-\u03B21 signalling and TGF-\u03B21 inhibition of Ace-2 gene expression. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate that hnRNP F stimulates Ace-2 gene transcription, prevents TGF-\u03B21 inhibition of Ace-2 gene transcription and induction of kidney injury in diabetes. HnRNP F may be a potential target for treating hypertension and renal fibrosis in diabetes.

Sitewise constraints exist in a non-spatial gradient from diverse to conserved in evolved antibody repertoires; yet non-antibody scaffolds generally do not implement this strategy in combinatorial libraries. Despite the fact that biased amino acid distributions, typically elevated in tyrosine, serine, and glycine, have gained wider use in synthetic scaffolds, these distributions are still predominantly applied uniformly to diversified sites. While select sites in fibronectin domains and DARPins have shown benefit from sitewise designs, they have not been deeply evaluated. Inspired by this disparity between diversity distributions in natural libraries and synthetic scaffold libraries, we hypothesized that binders resulting from discovery and evolution would exhibit a non-spatial, sitewise gradient of amino acid diversity. To identify sitewise diversities consistent with efficient evolution in the context of a hydrophilic fibronectin domain, \u003E10(5) binders to six targets were evolved and sequenced. Evolutionarily favorable amino acid distributions at 25 sites reveal Shannon entropies (range: 0.3\u20133.9; median: 2.1; standard deviation: 1.1) supporting the diversity gradient hypothesis. Sitewise constraints in evolved sequences are consistent with complementarity, stability, and consensus biases. Implementation of sitewise constrained diversity enables direct selection of nanomolar affinity binders validating an efficient strategy to balance inter- and intra-molecular interaction demands at each site.","publish_time":"2015-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woldring, Daniel R.; Holec, Patrick V.; Zhou, Hong; Hackel, Benjamin J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94f67a30df65c02cf339d2276e04afda40f59072.json; document_parses/pdf_json/68c511101e72f75c7c7146306567114789e25be4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4575168.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4575168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shannon"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diversity distributions","Sitewise constraints","sitewise gradient of amino acid diversity","sitewise designs","favorable amino acid distributions","Implementation of sitewise constrained diversity","sitewise diversities consistent","sites","biased amino acid distributions","non-antibody scaffolds","non-spatial gradient","diversity gradient hypothesis","synthetic scaffolds","combinatorial libraries","efficient strategy","efficient evolution","natural libraries","synthetic scaffold libraries","evolved antibody repertoires","evolved sequences","balance","small protein scaffolds","combinatorial library","fibronectin domains","direct selection of nanomolar affinity binders","favorable intermolecular interactions","hydrophilic fibronectin domain","appropriate mutations","complementarity","context","DARPins","intra-molecular interaction","stability","benefit","wider use","Shannon entropies","new binding function","glycine","intramolecular integrity","range","tyrosine","fact","disparity","consensus biases","discovery","standard deviation","serine","targets"],"language":"en"},

We studied 282 psychiatric outpatients (156 with suicide attempts and 126 without suicide attempts). Sera of patients were analyzed for the presence of anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies by using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay. One of the 156 (0.6%) suicide attempters and 1 (0.8%) of the 126 controls were positive for anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies (OR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.04\u201313.02; P = 1.00).

OBJECTIVE: To describe how pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 [A(H1N1)pdm09] activity varied during the 2009\u20132010 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed influenza virological data compiled by the World Health Organization from June 2009\u2013August 2010. We calculated weekly proportions of A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010positive specimens out of all A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010positive specimens detected during the study period for each country. We compared parameters of pandemic activity (e.g., peak A[H1N1]pdm09 weekly proportion [peak activity], number of weeks between the 5th and 95th percentiles of A(H1N1)pdm09 cumulative weekly proportion [duration of activity]) between countries in temperate and tropical\u2013subtropical regions. We quantified the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 out of all influenza A specimens by country and correlated it with countries\u0027 central latitudes. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 80 countries (47 temperate, 33 tropical\u2013subtropical). The median proportion of cases identified during the peak week was higher in temperate (0\u00B712) than in tropical\u2013subtropical (0\u00B709) regions (P \u003C 0\u00B701). The median duration of activity was longer in tropical\u2013subtropical (27 weeks) than in temperate countries (20 weeks) (P \u003C 0\u00B701). In most temperate countries (98%), peak pandemic activity occurred during the fall\u2013winter period. There was a positive correlation between country central latitude and proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 out of all influenza A specimens (r: 0\u00B776; P \u003C 0\u00B701). CONCLUSIONS: The transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 exhibited similarities with seasonal influenza transmission in that activity varied between temperate and tropical\u2013subtropical countries and by time of year.

From January 2012 to November 2014, 1876 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (NPAs) were collected from hospitalized children with RTIs. Among the 1876 NPAs, EV-D68 was detected in 19 samples (1.0%, 19/1876). Of these, 13 samples were detected in September and October 2014 (9.8%, 13/132). Phylogenetic analysis showed that all 13 strains detected in the 2014 Chongqing had high homology with the main strains of the 2014 US outbreak. Among the children with EV-D68 infection, 13 (68%) had a history of recurrent wheezing. A total of 13 children had a discharge diagnosis of asthma. Of these, 11 children were diagnosed with acute asthma exacerbation. EV-D68 was the predominant pathogen that evoked asthma exacerbation in September and October 2014.

Although not fully characterized, these innate antiviral responses are fine-tuned by dynamic ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes. In this study, we report ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) 15 is involved in regulation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-dependent type I IFN induction pathway. Knockdown of endogenous USP15 augmented cellular antiviral responses. Overexpression of USP15 inhibited the transcription of IFN-\u03B2. Further analyses identified histidine 862 as a critical residue for USP15\u2019s catalytic activity. Interestingly, USP15 specifically removed lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I among the essential components in RIG-I-like receptor-dependent pathway. In addition, we demonstrated that in contrast to USP15 de-ubiquitinating (DUB) activity, USP15-mediated inhibition of IFN signaling was not abolished by mutations eliminating the catalytic activity, indicating that a fraction of USP15-mediated IFN antagonism was independent of the DUB activity. Catalytically inactive USP15 mutants, as did the wild-type protein, disrupted virus-induced interaction of RIG-I and IFN-\u03B2 promoter stimulator 1. Taken together, our data demonstrate that USP15 acts as a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling via DUB-dependent and independent mechanisms.","publish_time":"2015-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Huan; Wang, Dang; Zhong, Huijuan; Luo, Rui; Shang, Min; Liu, Dezhi; Chen, Huanchun; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7b980605c4ba138f35378e5f56b95e677cc87c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4650652.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4650652/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzczMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fraction of USP15","USP15 acts","Overexpression of USP15","USP15-mediated inhibition of IFN","transcription of IFN","USP15 de-ubiquitinating","Knockdown of endogenous USP15","inactive USP15 mutants","DUB activity","transcription of type","DUB-dependent","dependent type","mediated IFN antagonism","IFN induction pathway","negative regulator of RIG","s catalytic activity","IFN-\u03B2 promoter stimulator","receptor-dependent pathway","disrupted virus-induced interaction of RIG","transcription factors nuclear factor-\u03BAB","wild-type protein","cellular antiviral responses","innate antiviral responses","NF-\u03BAB","independent mechanisms","interferon regulatory factor","critical residue","dynamic ubiquitination","contrast","retinoic acid-inducible gene","linked polyubiquitin chains","regulation","IRF3","lysine","ubiquitin-specific protease","series","deubiquitination processes","histidine","interferons","IFNs","essential components","mutations","Viral infection","cascades","study","analyses","data","addition"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we focused on CARD9, a signaling adaptor known to regulate innate immune activation through multiple innate sensor proteins, and investigated its role in anti-IFV defense and lung pathogenesis in a mouse model recapitulating severe influenza pneumonia with ARDS. We found that influenza pneumonia was dramatically attenuated in Card9-deficient mice, which showed improved mortality with reduced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the infected lungs. However, viral clearance, type-I interferon production, and the development of anti-viral B and T cell immunity were not compromised by CARD9 deficiency. Syk or CARD9-deficient DCs but not macrophages showed impaired cytokine but not type-I interferon production in response to IFV in vitro, indicating a possible role for the Syk-CARD9 pathway in DCs in excessive inflammation of IFV-infected lungs.

Guidelines recommend high-dose steroids treatment despite unproven benefit. We hypothesized that previous immunosuppression and the administration of high-dose steroids adversely affect IPF-AE outcome. METHODS: We studied all consecutive patients hospitalized in our department for IPF deterioration from 2007 to June 2013. Our protocol consisted of immediate cessation of immunosuppression (if any), best supportive care, broad-spectrum antimicrobials and thorough evaluation to detect reversible causes of deterioration. Patients were followed-up for survival; post-discharge none received immunosuppression. RESULTS: Twenty-four out of 85 admissions (28 %) fulfilled IPF-AE criteria. IPF-AE were analyzed both as unique events and as unique patients. As unique events 50 % survived; 3 out of 12 (25 %) in the group previously treated with immunosuppression whereas nine out of 12 (75 %) in the group not receiving immunosuppression (p = 0.041). As unique patients 35.3 % survived; 3 out of 6 (50 %) in the never treated group whereas three out of 11 (27.3 %) in the group receiving immunosuppression (p = 0.685).

The server resides in a cluster of 64 cores and is equipped with an interactive, collapsible, and expandable tree display. It is capable of comparing the tree branching order with prokaryotic classification at all taxonomic ranks from domains down to species and strains. CVTree3 allows for inquiry by taxon names and trial on lineage modifications. In addition, it reports a summary of monophyletic and non-monophyletic taxa at all ranks as well as produces print-quality subtree figures. After giving an overview of retrospective verification of the CVTree approach, the power of the new server is described for the mega-classification of prokaryotes and determination of taxonomic placement of some newly-sequenced genomes. A few discrepancies between CVTree and 16S rRNA analyses are also summarized with regard to possible taxonomic revisions.

To understand HRV and HEV molecular epidemiology in this setting, we enrolled febrile pediatric patients participating in a large prospective cohort assessing the causes of fever in Tanzanian children. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs were systematically collected and tested by real-time RT-PCR for HRV and HEV. Viruses from positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were then applied to highlight the HRV and HEV types as well as recombinant or divergent strains. Thirty-eight percent (378/1005) of the enrolled children harboured an HRV or HEV infection. Although some types were predominant, many distinct types were co-circulating, including a vaccinal poliovirus, HEV-A71 and HEV-D68. Three HRV-A recombinants were identified: HRV-A36/HRV-A67, HRV-A12/HRV-A67 and HRV-A96/HRV-A61. Four divergent HRV strains were also identified: one HRV-B strain and three HRV-C strains.

The modulation of host-virus interactions is a promising strategy to combat the virus; however, the interactions between the host and avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV) are unclear. Using genome-wide transcriptome studies in combination with a bioinformatic analysis, we identified proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) to be an important modulator of ILTV infection. Src controls the virulence of ILTV and is phosphorylated upon ILTV infection. Functional studies revealed that Src prolongs the survival of host cells by increasing the threshold of virus-induced cell death. Therefore, Src is essential for viral replication in vitro and in ovo but is not required for ILTV-induced cell death. Furthermore, our results identify a positive-feedback loop between Src and the tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is necessary for the phosphorylation of either Src or FAK and is required for Src to modulate ILTV infection. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify a key host regulator controlling host-ILTV interactions. We believe that our findings have revealed a new potential therapeutic target for ILT control and therapy. IMPORTANCE Despite the extensive administration of live attenuated vaccines starting from the mid-20th century and the administration of recombinant vaccines in recent years, infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) outbreaks due to avian ILT herpesvirus (ILTV) occur worldwide annually. Presently, there are no drugs or control strategies that effectively treat ILT. Targeting of host-virus interactions is considered to be a promising strategy for controlling ILTV infections. However, little is known about the mechanisms governing host-ILTV interactions. The results from our study advance our understanding of host-ILTV interactions on a molecular level and provide experimental evidence that it is possible to control ILT via the manipulation of host-virus interactions.","publish_time":"2015-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hai; Wang, Fengjie; Han, Zongxi; Gao, Qi; Li, Huixin; Shao, Yuhao; Sun, Nana; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c3132687a4cd25b59f39f851b6b924c99afe345.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4702564.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4702564/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILTV","ILT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host-ILTV interactions","host-virus interactions","ILT control","ILTV infections","virulence of ILTV","understanding of host","manipulation of host","modulation of host","ILTV-induced cell death","avian ILT herpesvirus","important modulator of ILTV infection","survival of host cells","key host regulator","proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src","threshold of virus","control strategies","tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase","infectious laryngotracheitis","FAK","therapy","promising strategy","results","administration of recombinant vaccines","novel strategies","Functional studies","extensive administration of live attenuated vaccines","genome-wide transcriptome studies","recent years","new potential therapeutic target","combination","outbreaks","bioinformatic analysis","molecular level","century","positive-feedback loop","experimental evidence","viral replication","effects of vaccination","findings","IMPORTANCE","ovo","phosphorylation","study","mechanisms","drugs","best","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

It was the first oncogenic virus recognized and has been incriminated in the causation of tumors of both lymphatic and epithelial nature. It was reported in some previous studies that 95% of the population worldwide are serologically positive to the virus. Clinically, EBV primary infection is almost silent, persisting as a life-long asymptomatic latent infection in B cells although it may be responsible for a transient clinical syndrome called infectious mononucleosis. Following reactivation of the virus from latency due to immunocompromised status, EBV was found to be associated with several tumors. EBV linked to oncogenesis as detected in lymphoid tumors such as Burkitt\u0027s lymphoma (BL), Hodgkin\u0027s disease (HD), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) and T-cell lymphomas (e.g. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas; PTCL and Anaplastic large cell lymphomas; ALCL). It is also linked to epithelial tumors such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), gastric carcinomas and oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL). In vitro, EBV many studies have demonstrated its ability to transform B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Despite these malignancies showing different clinical and epidemiological patterns when studied, genetic studies have suggested that these EBV- associated transformations were characterized generally by low level of virus gene expression with only the latent virus proteins (LVPs) upregulated in both tumors and LCLs. In this review, we summarize some clinical and epidemiological features of EBV- associated tumors. We also discuss how EBV latent genes may lead to oncogenesis in the different clinical malignancies","publish_time":"2015-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ali, Abdelwahid Saeed; Al-Shraim, Mubarak; Al-Hakami, Ahmed Musa; Jones, Ian M","journal":"Open Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2511d6e6a5faa918701cd2bf6e2641ba7f4c9cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4740969.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740969/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTCL","ALCL","EBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated tumors","EBV latent genes","epithelial tumors","EBV- associated transformations","oncogenic virus","epidemiological features of EBV","latent virus proteins","EBV primary infection","lymphoid tumors","causation of tumors","Epstein-Barr virus","different clinical malignancies","Peripheral T-cell lymphomas","Anaplastic large cell lymphomas","low level of virus gene expression","lymphoblastoid cell lines","B cells","asymptomatic latent infection","transient clinical syndrome","oncogenesis","genetic studies","LCLs","previous studies","epidemiological patterns","epithelial nature","human pathogen","human herpesvirus","PTCL","gastric carcinomas","HD","PTLD","subfamily gammaherpesvirinae","post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders","family herpesviridae","Hodgkin\u0027s disease","NPC","order herpesvirales","Burkitt\u0027s lymphoma","nasopharyngeal carcinoma","oral hairy leukoplakia","latency","ability","OHL","infectious mononucleosis","member","ALCL","immunocompromised status","LVPs","genus lymphocytovirus","HHV4","population","reactivation","review"],"language":"en"},

Mass spectrometry has recently emerged as a central method and has permitted fundamental discoveries in virology. Here, we review mass spectrometry-based approaches that have recently allowed a better understanding of the composition of the herpesvirus virion.

Additionally, for many RNA viruses, replication to high titers results in the production of defective interfering particles (DIs) that also attenuate infection. We hypothesized that fidelity, recombination, and DI production are tightly linked. We show that a Sindbis virus mutator replicating at a high multiplicity of infection manifests an earlier and greater accumulation of DIs than its wild-type counterpart. The isolated DIs interfere with the replication of full-length virus in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the ability of the mutator virus to overproduce DIs could be linked to an increased recombination frequency. These data confirm that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fidelity and recombination are inversely correlated for this mutator. Our findings suggest that defective interference resulting from higher recombination rates may be more detrimental to RNA virus mutators than the increase in mutational burden. IMPORTANCE Replication, adaptation, and evolution of RNA viruses rely in large part on their low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses artificially modified in their polymerases to decrease fidelity (mutator viruses) are attenuated in vivo, demonstrating the important role of fidelity in viral fitness. However, attenuation was attributed solely to the modification of the viral mutation rate and the accumulation of detrimental point mutations. In this work, we described an additional phenotype of mutator viruses: an increased recombination rate leading to defective interfering particle (DI) overproduction. Because DIs are known for their inhibitory effect on viral replication, our work suggests that fidelity variants may be attenuated in vivo via several mechanisms. This has important implications in the development of fidelity variants as live attenuated vaccine strains.","publish_time":"2016-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poirier, Enzo Z.; Mounce, Bryan C.; Rozen-Gagnon, Kathryn; Hooikaas, Peter Jan; Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Moratorio, Gonzalo; Vignuzzi, Marco","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/281303193aa29253bb0b00328b48e892d0cf4f85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4810721.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4810721/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fidelity","Low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","RNA virus mutators","evolution of RNA viruses","development of fidelity variants","important role of fidelity","Sindbis virus mutator","viral replication","increased recombination rate","replication of full-length virus","increased recombination frequency","additional phenotype of mutator viruses","isolated DIs","greater accumulation of DIs","higher recombination rates","IMPORTANCE Replication","attenuated phenotypes","viral mutation rate","increased mutation rates","defective interference","production of defective interfering particles","dose-dependent manner","DI production","viral fitness","work","live attenuated vaccine strains","high multiplicity of infection","accumulation of detrimental point mutations","important implications","high titers results","adaptation","inhibitory effect","modification","overproduction","wild-type counterpart","mutational burden","data","findings","ability","attenuation","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Based on the effects of 4 shRNAs targeting different regions of HTNV genomic RNA on viral replication, the most effective RNA interference fragments of the S and M genes were constructed in pSilencer-3.0-H1 vectors, and designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M, respectively. The antiviral effect of pSilencer-S/M against HTNV was evaluated in both HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells and mice. RESULTS: In HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells, pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M targeted the viral nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins, respectively, as revealed in the immunofluorescence assay. Transfection with pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (1, 2, 4 \u03BCg) markedly inhibited the viral antigen expression in dose- and time-dependent manners. Transfection with either plasmid (2 \u03BCg) significantly decreased HTNV-RNA level at 3 day postinfectin (dpi) and the progeny virus titer at 5 dpi. In mice infected with lethal doses of HTNV, intraperitoneal injection of pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (30 \u03BCg) considerably increased the survival rates and mean time to death, and significantly reduced the mean virus yields and viral RNA level, and alleviated virus-induced pathological lesions in lungs, brains and kidneys.

Such emitters are commonly used as labels in assays for detection of chemical and biological species. Their interaction with surface plasmons allows amplifying fluorescence signal (brightness) that accompanies molecular binding events by several orders of magnitude. In conjunction with interfacial architectures for the specific capture of target analyte on a metallic surface, plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) that is also referred to as metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) represents an attractive method for shortening detection times and increasing sensitivity of various fluorescence-based analytical technologies.

The current status in many countries is to prepare influenza vaccine using cell-based or egg-based killed vaccine. However, traditional influenza vaccine platforms have several limitations. To overcome these limitations, many researchers have tried various approaches to develop alternative production platforms. One of the alternative approach, we reported the efficacy of influenza HA vaccination using a baculoviral DNA vaccine (AcHERV-HA). However, the immune response elicited by the AcHERV-HA vaccine, which only targets the HA antigen, was lower than that of the commercial killed vaccine. To overcome the limitations of this previous vaccine, we constructed a human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) envelope-coated, baculovirus-based, virus-like-particle (VLP)\u2013forming DNA vaccine (termed AcHERV-VLP) against pandemic influenza A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1). BALB/c mice immunized with AcHERV-VLP (1\u00D710(7) FFU AcHERV-VLP, i.m.) and compared with mice immunized with the killed vaccine or mice immunized with AcHERV-HA. As a result, AcHERV-VLP immunization produced a greater humoral immune response and exhibited neutralizing activity with an intrasubgroup H1 strain (PR8), elicited neutralizing antibody production, a high level of interferon-\u03B3 secretion in splenocytes, and diminished virus shedding in the lung after challenge with a lethal dose of influenza virus. In conclusion, VLP-forming baculovirus DNA vaccine could be a potential vaccine candidate capable of efficiently delivering DNA to the vaccinee and VLP forming DNA eliciting stronger immunogenicity than egg-based killed vaccines.","publish_time":"2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gwon, Yong-Dae; Kim, Sehyun; Cho, Yeondong; Heo, Yoonki; Cho, Hansam; Park, Kihoon; Lee, Hee-Jung; Choi, Jiwon; Poo, Haryoung; Kim, Young Bong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5edd56f96660760a5f8ae69efd7d9e976a00c4ee.json; document_parses/pdf_json/106b81593063e1df0817b8ca2e0a90823003201d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4858234.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4858234/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzkyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AcHERV-HA vaccine","baculovirus DNA vaccine","previous vaccine","baculoviral DNA vaccine","commercial killed vaccine","traditional influenza vaccine platforms","AcHERV-VLP immunization","termed AcHERV-VLP","FFU AcHERV-VLP","influenza pandemic","pandemic influenza","potential vaccine candidate capable","efficacy of influenza HA vaccination","lethal dose of influenza virus","HA antigen","outbreak of influenza H1N1","limitations","killed vaccines","egg","alternative production platforms","diminished virus","c mice","elicited neutralizing antibody production","neutralizing activity","greater humoral immune response","alternative approach","high level of interferon","PR8","\u03B3 secretion","intrasubgroup H1 strain","stronger immunogenicity","various approaches","envelope","lung","splenocytes","human endogenous retrovirus","challenge","countries","vaccinee","researchers","California","BALB","result","conclusion","particle","cell","current status","century","individuals","lives","pH1N1"],"language":"en"},

Acute inflammation is a form of innate immune defence and represents one of the primary responses to injury, infection and irritation, largely mediated by granulocyte effector cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils. Failure to remove an inflammatory stimulus (often resulting in failed resolution of inflammation) can lead to chronic inflammation resulting in tissue injury caused by high numbers of infiltrating activated granulocytes. Successful resolution of inflammation is dependent upon the removal of these cells. Under normal physiological conditions, apoptosis (programmed cell death) precedes phagocytic recognition and clearance of these cells by, for example, macrophages, dendritic and epithelial cells (a process known as efferocytosis). Inflammation contributes to immune defence within the respiratory mucosa (responsible for gas exchange) because lung epithelia are continuously exposed to a multiplicity of airborne pathogens, allergens and foreign particles. Failure to resolve inflammation within the respiratory mucosa is a major contributor of numerous lung diseases. This review will summarise the major mechanisms regulating lung inflammation, including key cellular interplays such as apoptotic cell clearance by alveolar macrophages and macrophage/neutrophil/epithelial cell interactions. The different acute and chronic inflammatory disease states caused by dysregulated/impaired resolution of lung inflammation will be discussed. Furthermore, the resolution of lung inflammation during neutrophil/eosinophil-dominant lung injury or enhanced resolution driven via pharmacological manipulation will also be considered.","publish_time":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robb, C.

The hNPCs used in that study were derived by a novel direct differentiation method (direct differentiation, DD-NPCs) that resulted in a unique gene expression pattern when compared to hNPCs derived by conventional methods. Since the therapeutic potential of human NPCs may differ greatly depending on the method of derivation and culture, we wanted to determine whether NPCs differentiated using conventional methods would be similarly effective in improving clinical outcome under neuroinflammatory demyelinating conditions. For the current study, we utilized hNPCs differentiated from a human induced pluripotent cell line via an embryoid body intermediate stage (EB-NPCs). Intraspinal transplantation of EB-NPCs into mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) resulted in decreased accumulation of CD4\u002B T cells in the central nervous system that was concomitant with reduced demyelination at the site of injection. Dampened neuroinflammation and remyelination was correlated with a transient increase in CD4\u002BFOXP3\u002B regulatory T cells (Tregs) concentrated within the peripheral lymphatics. However, compared to our earlier study, pathological improvements were modest and did not result in significant clinical recovery. We conclude that the genetic signature of NPCs is critical to their effectiveness in this model of viral-induced neurologic disease. These comparisons will be useful for understanding what factors are critical for the sustained clinical improvement.","publish_time":"2016-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plaisted, Warren C.; Zavala, Angel; Hingco, Edna; Tran, Ha; Coleman, Ronald; Lane, Thomas E.; Loring, Jeanne F.; Walsh, Craig M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0444a2148ffe99348088aa7c04e21dcea70d602.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4911106.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911106/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EB-NPCs","DD-NPCs","therapeutic potential of human NPCs","genetic signature of NPCs","hNPCs","sustained clinical recovery","human embryonic stem cells","clinical outcome","regulatory T cells","sustained clinical improvement","significant clinical recovery","transplantation of neural precursor cells","remyelination","viral model","model of viral","human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis","dampened neuroinflammation","earlier study","current study","conventional methods","human induced pluripotent cell line","novel direct differentiation method","Intraspinal transplantation of EB","neurologic disease","method of derivation","decreased accumulation of CD4","neuroinflammatory demyelinating conditions","embryoid body intermediate stage","FOXP3","neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","central nervous system","concomitant","JHMV","Tregs","mice","hESCs","reduced demyelination","transient increase","pathological improvements","unique gene expression pattern","factors","effectiveness","site of injection","peripheral lymphatics","culture","comparisons"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, we not only define the theoretical dimensions of these innovation processes but also the functional outputs in the form of tangible technologies/devices. But while the intellectual components of these processes are critical, what does this mean for the future of humanitarian medicine and innovation? The fact of the matter is that the deployment of innovation processes in conflict and crisis situations will likely consist of an amalgam of these processes that is utilized as a catalyst for high-functioning problem-solving in the field. The reality is that crisis and conflict situations are not black and white; thus the solutions developed in the field are likely to reflect this. This is where we examine the field-based applications of these technologies and their specific capacities to preserve human life. But before we delve into these medical devices, who are these devices meant for? There are three critical stakeholders in any humanitarian healthcare operation: humanitarian practitioners (i.e., doctors, nurses, aides, relief workers), community health workers (i.e., frontline public health workers from indigenous communities), and crisis-stricken communities themselves. While the scope and capacity to utilize devices varies among these groups, nonetheless, it is vital that each one of these stakeholders be properly retrofitted with the most basic of equipment, technology, and devices. In this book we take this a step further and examine how we can not only enhance the retrofitting of humanitarian operators but also their respective problem-solving and innovation processes to create \u201Cadaptive solutions.\u201D We define these as high-utility, unconventional solutions that are derived in resource-poor settings. The reality is that while we can provide frugal devices to individuals, how do we stimulate continued innovation and the implementation of adaptive solutions on the ground? The innovation process is just as important as the device itself\u2014a paradigm that is often overlooked.","publish_time":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramadurai, Krish W.; Bhatia, Sujata K.","journal":"Reimagining Innovation in Humanitarian Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ccf06d97597c4def89d4c70af568a6eb983d586.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7139446.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7139446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frugal innovation","various innovation processes","deployment of innovation processes","reverse innovation","continued innovation","novel innovation paradigms","frugal devices","medical devices","humanitarian practitioners","crisis situations","unconventional solutions","implementation of adaptive solutions","relief workers","community health workers","humanitarian healthcare operation","conflict situations","retrofitting of humanitarian operators","future of humanitarian medicine","crisis-stricken communities","critical stakeholders","reality","frontline public health workers","field-based applications","indigenous communities","high-utility","form of tangible technologies","functional outputs","nurses","aides","doctors","specific capacities","human life","technology","matter","ground","intellectual components","individuals","catalyst","theoretical dimensions","resource-poor settings","basic of equipment","previous chapter","groups","scope","capacity","amalgam","book","step","fact"],"language":"en"},

By comparing with the Western urban discourse, we clarify the process of how Tokyo became divided in terms of residential conditions. The national government focused on the growth of major metropolitan areas, stimulating suburban development and homeownership in the suburbs from the 1950s to the 1980s. However, after the late 1990s, the target shifted from the suburbs to the city centers. Alongside global competition among cities, the long-term recession of the Japanese economy, and social changes, continuous investment to grow central Tokyo has increased in importance. In contrast, suburban neighborhoods are facing challenges related to an aging population and an increase in housing vacancies. Although government intervention is necessary, there are limited possibilities for the outer suburbs to revitalize and re-grow. The sharp contrast between the growth in city centers and the shrinking suburbs, and specifically the divided Tokyo, will become more obvious in the next decade.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kubo, Tomoko","journal":"Divided Tokyo","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/503fd489285f808a975524f3900a2452a3773e86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7143446.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7143446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Tokyo"],"keyphrases":["outer suburbs","shrinking suburbs","divided Tokyo","central Tokyo","city centers","national government","s onward","urban planning","social changes","long-term recession","suburban development","long-term trajectories","suburban neighborhoods","housing vacancies","sharp contrast","government intervention","re-grow","Western urban discourse","growth of major metropolitan areas","municipal policies","Japanese economy","land use","continuous investment","challenges","aging population","limited possibilities","generation of Tokyo\u2019s division","increase","time","cities","homeownership","process","terms of residential conditions","global competition","chapter","outcomes","target","importance","decade"],"language":"en"},

Infections could be a trigger of the inflammation. The main aim of this study was to describe the presence of infections in children with KD, and to analyse the clinical characteristics and the presence of coronary abnormalities in these cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed within the Kawasaki Disease network (KAWA-RACE (2011-2016). An analysis was performed that included patients with positive microbiological findings (PMF) during the acute phase, as well as those with a previous recent infection (PRI) during the 4 weeks preceding KD diagnosis. RESULTS: The study included a total of 621 children with KD, with PMF being found in 101 (16.3%) patients, and a PRI in 107 (17.2%). Significantly less echocardiographic abnormalities were found in the group with a PRI, when compared to those without a PRI (23 vs. 35%, P = .01) and also a lower proportion of overall coronary artery lesions (16 vs. 25%, P = .054). No significant differences were found in the proportion of aneurysms in either of these groups (PRI or PMF) when compared to those without infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, no differences were found in the incidence of coronary aneurysms in either of the groups, with or without PRI or PMF. Therefore, if KD is suspected, appropriate treatment should be started despite having a confirmed infection.","publish_time":"2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fern\u00E1ndez-Cooke, Elisa; Tasc\u00F3n, Ana Barrios; Ant\u00F3n-L\u00F3pez, Jordi; Grasa Lozano, Carlos Daniel; S\u00E1nchez-Manubens, Judith; Calvo, Cristina","journal":"An Pediatr (Engl Ed)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146762.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146762/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","Kawasaki Disease","PMF","KD","PRI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PMF","coronary artery abnormalities","presence of coronary abnormalities","PATIENTS","retrospective study","present study","incidence of coronary aneurysms","weeks preceding KD diagnosis","children","proportion of aneurysms","presence of infections","echocardiographic abnormalities","groups","confirmed infection","lower proportion of overall coronary artery lesions","Kawasaki Disease network","previous recent infection","significant differences","multisystem vasculitis","positive microbiological findings","KAWA-RACE","clinical characteristics","total","METHODS","INTRODUCTION","cases","acute phase","trigger","main aim","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","appropriate treatment","inflammation","analysis"],"language":"en"},

The literature generally suggests that most health professionals\u2019 knowledge of infection control principles and standards is poor or, at the very least, inadequate. There is a paucity of research examining paramedic knowledge of infection control principles and standards, particularly in the Australian pre-hospital context. The purpose of this study was to determine paramedic knowledge of standard infection control definitions and principles in an Australian emergency medical system (EMS). A confidential and anonymous mail survey was distributed to all paramedics working in a State-wide Australian ambulance service (n=2274) A total of 1258 surveys were returned - a response rate of 55.3%. Only 46.2% (n=581) of the participants identified the correct components of the \u2019chain of infection\u2019. Correct identification of the definition of \u2019nosocomial\u2019 was made by 27,9% (n=347) of participants. Less than one-fifth (17.2%, n=217) of participants identified \u0027standards and additional precautions\u2019 as the current system of infection control. Less than half (41.6%, n=523) of the sample correctly identified hand washing as the primary\u2019 infection control strategy\u2019 to prevent cross-infection. This study suggests knowledge of fundamental principles and standards of infection control among paramedics is poor in this jurisdiction and recommends the introduction of comprehensive in-service education programmes in infection control. Further research is required to investigate if, and how, these results may be realised in practice.","publish_time":"2016-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaban, Ramon Z.","journal":"Aust Infect Control","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["standards of infection control","infection control strategy","paramedic knowledge of infection control principles","cross-infection","chain of infection","current system of infection control","health professionals\u2019 knowledge of infection control principles","paramedic knowledge of standard infection control definitions","knowledge of fundamental principles","participants","paramedics","study","Australian emergency medical system","State-wide Australian ambulance service","Australian pre-hospital context","correct components","Correct identification","paucity of research","essential component of health care","introduction of comprehensive in-service education programmes","additional precautions\u2019","primary","hand washing","jurisdiction","EMS","anonymous mail survey","surveys","sample","response rate","literature","total","results","practice","purpose","half"],"language":"en"},

In this paper we present a legal search problem where professionals monitor news articles with constant queries on a periodic basis. Firstly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using traditional retrieval models against the Boolean search of documents in chronological order. In an attempt to capture the complex information needs of users, a learning to rank approach is adopted with user specified relevance criteria as features. This approach, however, only achieves mediocre results compared to the traditional models. However, we find that by fine-tuning a contextualised language model (e.g. BERT), significantly improved retrieval performance can be achieved, providing a flexible solution to satisfying complex information needs without explicit feature engineering.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanchez, Luis; He, Jiyin; Manotumruksa, Jarana; Albakour, Dyaa; Martinez, Miguel; Lipani, Aldo","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2928c8d4a116265bd208cdafcd2d76cacde4fad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148065/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Web search","traditional retrieval models","complex information needs of users","traditional models","legal search problem","Boolean search of documents","professional search tasks","dedicated search strategies","improved retrieval performance","professionals monitor news articles","constant queries","BERT","solutions","explicit feature engineering","systems","user specified relevance criteria","rapid advances","features","chronological order","learning","flexible solution","periodic basis","mediocre results","contextualised language model","common issues","paper","effectiveness","attempt","approaches"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge graph embedding has been an active research area for knowledge graph completion, with great improvement from the early TransE to the current state-of-the-art ConvKB. ConvKB considers a knowledge graph as a set of triples, and employs a convolutional neural network to capture global relationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relations in the knowledge graph. However, it only utilizes the triple information, and ignores the rich information contained in relation paths. In fact, a path of one relation describes the relation from some aspect in a fine-grained way. Therefore, it is beneficial to take relation paths into consideration for knowledge graph embedding. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network-based embedding model PConvKB, which improves knowledge graph embedding by incorporating relation paths locally and globally. Specifically, we introduce attention mechanism to measure the local importance of relation paths. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective measure DIPF to compute the global importance of relation paths.

Currently, two classes of approaches exist to classify a relation between words (concepts) X and Y: (1) path-based and (2) distributional. While the path-based approaches look at word-paths connecting X and Y in text, the distributional approaches look at statistical properties of X and Y separately, not necessary in the proximity of each other. Here, we suggest how both types can be improved and empirically compare them using several standard benchmarking datasets. For our distributional approach, we are suggesting using an attention-based transformer. While they are known to be capable of supporting knowledge transfer between different tasks, and recently set a number of benchmarking records in various applications, we are the first to successfully apply them to the task of recognizing semantic relations. To improve a path-based approach, we are suggesting our original neural word path model that combines useful properties of convolutional and recurrent networks, and thus addressing several shortcomings from the prior path-based models.

It aims to enhance the performance of text-based image retrieval by boosting the rank of relevant images using visual information. Hypergraph has been widely used for relevance estimation, where textual results are taken as vertices and the re-ranking problem is formulated as a transductive learning on the hypergraph. The potential of the hypergraph learning is essentially determined by the hypergraph construction scheme. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel data representation technique named adaptive collaborative representation for hypergraph learning. Compared to the conventional collaborative representation, we consider the data locality to adaptively select relevant and close samples for a test sample and discard irrelevant and faraway ones. Moreover, at the feature level, we impose a weight matrix on the representation errors to adaptively highlight the important features and reduce the effect of redundant/noisy ones. Finally, we also add a nonnegativity constraint on the representation coefficients to enhance the hypergraph interpretability. These attractive properties allow constructing a more informative and quality hypergraph, thereby achieving better retrieval performance than other hypergraph models. Extensive experiments on the public MediaEval benchmarks demonstrate that our re-ranking method achieves consistently superior results, compared to state-of-the-art methods.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouhlel, Noura; Feki, Ghada; Amar, Chokri Ben","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8cc7fe29cd4a7c1480cf6f36b698db6103b1a53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148239.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148239/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hypergraph learning","quality hypergraph","hypergraph models","hypergraph interpretability","hypergraph construction scheme","representation errors","representation coefficients","adaptive collaborative representation","conventional collaborative representation","Visual re-ranking","re-ranking method","re-ranking problem","novel data representation technique","transductive learning","better retrieval performance","superior results","data locality","textual results","performance of text","visual information","faraway ones","noisy ones","based image retrieval","rank of relevant images","test sample","public MediaEval benchmarks","considerable attention","vertices","effect of redundant","close samples","weight matrix","Extensive experiments","important features","recent years","relevance estimation","paper","state-of-the-art methods","nonnegativity constraint","feature level","attractive properties","potential","end"],"language":"en"},

However, both strategies solely rely on the input words to predict the lexical semantic relation. In this paper, we make the hypothesis that the decision process should not only rely on the input words but also on their K closest neighbors in some semantic space. For that purpose, we present different binary and multi-task classification strategies that include two distinct attention mechanisms based on PageRank. Evaluation results over four gold-standard datasets show that average improvements of 10.6% for binary and 8% for multi-task classification can be achieved over baseline approaches in terms of F[Formula: see text].

By 2020, COPD will be the third leading cause of death and the fifth leading cause of disability. It is \u2013 along with chronic congestive heart failure \u2013 one of the most common causes of unscheduled hospital readmissions, and as such it represents a significant economic burden for the health-care system. Exacerbations of COPD are important events in the natural history of this prevalent condition. DISCUSSION: This review provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art look at prevention and management of COPD exacerbations. Treatment of these episodes has to be tailored to the severity of the clinical presentation. We now have a wide range of therapeutic available options, based on the results of clinical trials. Management of the acute event should include the necessary measures (mainly the administration of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, inhaled or oral corticosteroids, and antibiotics), with or without oxygen and ventilator support. CONCLUSIONS: To improve the management of COPD exacerbations, the focus of care must be shifted from the episodic acute complications to their systematic prevention. The management of COPD, which is often associated with multiple co-morbidities, is complex and requires a tailored, multifaceted and multidisciplinary approach. Integrated care for COPD also requires that patients be informed about their condition, that they participate actively in their care, and that they have easy access to the necessary health-care services.","publish_time":"2011-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belmonte, Gelorma; Muratori, Marilena; Leandri, Paolo; Pasquale, Angelo; Reta, Massimo; Nardi, Roberto","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c599ba9638065f9d9fce6a191e9b94e71085ae9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Exacerbations of COPD","management of COPD exacerbations","leading cause of death","leading cause of hospitalization","leading cause of disability","focus of care","Integrated care","health-care system","necessary health-care services","necessary measures","systematic prevention","acute event","prevalent condition","clinical presentation","episodic acute complications","results of clinical trials","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","chronic congestive heart failure","administration of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators","Internal Medicine departments","Italy","comprehensive state-of-the-art look","natural history","important events","wide range of therapeutic available options","common causes of unscheduled hospital readmissions","oral corticosteroids","review","INTRODUCTION","significant economic burden","easy access","oxygen","antibiotics","multiple co-morbidities","multidisciplinary approach","patients","ventilator support","DISCUSSION","severity","word","Treatment","episodes","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The oral mucosa manifests local or systemic disease and derangements produced by therapeutic agents. A significant proportion of therapy-related oral drug reactions appear to be lichenoid reactions, erythema multiforme, and bullous lesions similar to idiosyncratic or immune-mediated skin reactions. Inflammation of the oral cavity (stomatitis) may involve the buccal mucosa, the gingiva, the tongue, and the peridontal tissues. Stomatitis can be induced by systemic administration of high doses of therapeutic agents. Anticonvulsant drugs may also produce changes in the dentition of humans and experimental animals. Discoloration of the teeth and bone is a well-described adverse effect of tetracycline administration and it has also been reported in patients who were treated with the semisynthetic derivative, minocycline. Drug-induced overgrowth of the gingival tissues is a well-described phenomenon in both humans and laboratory animals, including dogs, cats, and rats. Sessile or pedunculated squamous papillomas and infiltrating squamous carcinomas are occasionally found in the oral cavity of most laboratory animals, including rodents, rabbits, and beagle dogs.","publish_time":"2007-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greaves, Peter","journal":"Histopathology of Preclinical Toxicity Studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/feb5fe50c9b52f37dec75d7d3c4c7601195f6106.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158326.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158326/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oral cavity","related oral drug reactions","drug-induced changes","laboratory animals","Drug-induced overgrowth","lichenoid reactions","oral mucosa manifests local","experimental animals","stomatitis","well-described phenomenon","systemic administration of high doses of therapeutic agents","systemic disease","well-described adverse effect of tetracycline administration","immune-mediated skin reactions","gingival tissues","squamous carcinomas","dentition of humans","buccal mucosa","beagle dogs","peridontal tissues","pedunculated squamous papillomas","bullous lesions similar","erythema multiforme","bone","derangements","significant proportion of therapy","rodents","rabbits","tongue","teeth","cats","digestive system","Inflammation","chapter","semisynthetic derivative","minocycline","Discoloration","Anticonvulsant drugs","rats","patients"],"language":"en"},

Intermediates between these modes exist. Convergent evolution has occasionally occurred, as shown by high ecological similarity of species in different taxonomic sections within Pinus. However, the analogies between species are imperfect, suggesting the importance of constraint by shared ancestry and divergence produced by a diversity of environments.","publish_time":"1988-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCune, Bruce","journal":"Am J Bot","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d333de27b119f40040d16936882a42f8e2ccda0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159465/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pinus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tolerant species","resilient species","fire\u2010resistant species","high ecological similarity of species","fast\u2010growing mesophytic species","species of southern mesic sites","North American species of pine","Ecological groups","ecological traits","large cones","small seeds","dispersed seeds","long needles","dry sites","serotinous cones","adaptive modes","high shade tolerance","short persistence of needles","fast growth","heavy wood","multivariate analysis","stress","different taxonomic sections","divergence","importance of constraint","precocious reproducers","animal","shared ancestry","Pinus","diversity of environments","analogies","Convergent evolution","Intermediates"],"language":"en"},

Approach \u2013 The chapter begins with a rhetorical analysis of one particularly influential account of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Therein, we learn that the race to discover the outbreak\u0027s aetiology was tainted by scientific malpractice; that an esteemed Chinese microbiologist, Dr. Hong, apparently promoted his own, patently false, aetiological discovery, stifled debate on the matter and, in doing so, held the international response to the outbreak back by a number of weeks. But how was this account rhetorically constructed? And how did it engage with Dr. Hong\u0027s own research work? Findings \u2013 Does Hong deserve to be remembered as an inept scientist? Subsequent accounts have been quick to repeat this one, founding text\u0027s account, suggesting that \u2018yes, he does\u2019. This chapter, however, returns to the primary data, examines the ways in which the original account troped those data and moves to suggest that \u2018no, he does not\u2019. Contributions to the field \u2013 Teasing out the more general implications of this particular case study, the chapter concludes with a discussion of the analytical gains that might accrue if other popular scientific histories of emerging epidemics were approached as \u2018topics\u2019 rather than \u2018resources\u2019.","publish_time":"2010-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Attenborough, Frederick","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161675.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chapter","ways","influential account","primary data","original account","text\u0027s account","popular scientific histories of emerging epidemics","primary historical data","understanding","generations of popular science histories of emerging epidemics","scientific malpractice","severe acute respiratory syndrome","stifled debate","SARS","particular case study","esteemed Chinese microbiologist","aetiological discovery","general implications","outbreak\u0027s aetiology","rhetorical analysis","matter","transformations impact","discussion","topics\u2019","analytical gains","Subsequent accounts","Hong\u0027s","research work","field","ability","race","international response","number of weeks","Purpose","aims","inept scientist","Contributions","resources\u2019","Findings","Approach","does\u2019"],"language":"en"},

In virus\u2010infected cells in culture, a special membrane compartment is seen to accumulate. Our studies with rat liver show a similar response to temperature both in situ with slices and in vitro with isolated transitional endoplasmic relticulum fractions. With isolated transitional endoplasmic reticulum fractions, when incubated in the presence of nucleoside triphosphate and a cytosol fraction, temperature dependent formation of vesicles occurred with a Q(10) of \u22122 but was apparent only at temperatures greater than 12\u00B0C. A similar response was seen in situ at 12\u00B0C and 16\u00B0C where fusion of transition vesicles with cis Golgi apparatus, but not their formation, was blocked and transition vesicles accumulated in large numbers. At 18\u00B0C and below and especially at 8\u00B0C and 12\u00B0C, the cells responded by accumulating smooth tubular transitional membranes near the cis Golgi apparatus face. With cells and tissue slices at 20\u00B0C neither transition vesicles nor the smooth tubular elements accumulated.

Fresh produce has been identified as an important vehicle for their transmission. In order to supply a basis to identify possible prevention and control strategies, this review intends to demonstrate the fate of foodborne viruses in the farm to fork chain of fresh produce, which include the introduction routes (contamination sources), the viral survival abilities at different stages, and the reactions of foodborne viruses towards the treatments used in food processing of fresh produce. In general, the preharvest contamination comes mainly from soli fertilizer or irrigation water, while the harvest and postharvest contaminations come mainly from food handlers, which can be both symptomatic and asymptomatic. Foodborne viruses show high stabilities in all the stages of fresh produce production and processing. Low\u2010temperature storage and other currently used preservation techniques, as well as washing by water have shown limited added value for reducing the virus load on fresh produce. Chemical sanitizers, although with limitations, are strongly recommended to be applied in the wash water in order to minimize cross\u2010contamination. Alternatively, radiation strategies have shown promising inactivating effects on foodborne viruses. For high\u2010pressure processing and thermal treatment, efforts have to be made on setting up treatment parameters to induce sufficient viral inactivation within a food matrix and to protect the sensory and nutritional qualities of fresh produce to the largest extent.","publish_time":"2015-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Dan; De Keuckelaere, Ann; Uyttendaele, Mieke","journal":"Compr Rev Food Sci Food Saf","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e28d950992ed9dbeac66a89d6c83dc3648f64bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162173.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chemical"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["food processing of fresh produce","chain of fresh produce","important foodborne viruses","stages of fresh produce production","reactions of foodborne viruses","fate of foodborne viruses","nutritional qualities of fresh produce","food matrix","contamination sources","food handlers","irrigation water","high\u2010pressure processing","wash water","preharvest contamination","order","different stages","control strategies","virus load","radiation strategies","treatment parameters","thermal treatment","important vehicle","sufficient viral inactivation","viral survival abilities","used preservation techniques","promising inactivating effects","farm","treatments","limited added value","washing","soli fertilizer","temperature storage","possible prevention","postharvest contaminations","introduction routes","high stabilities","basis","review","efforts","cross","HAV","largest extent","hepatitis","Chemical sanitizers","limitations","transmission","Norovirus"],"language":"en"},

Data from these collections were used to examine spatial and temporal patterns in species assemblage structure and abundance. The years 2001\u20132005 were unusual because the EBS water temperature was \u2018warm\u2019 compared with the long\u2010term mean temperature. In contrast, 2007 was a \u2018cold\u2019 year. The abundance of the five most numerous taxa at 12 stations common to all years sampled (1996\u20132005, 2007) were significantly different among years. Larval and early juvenile stage Theragra chalcogramma (walleye pollock), a commercially important gadid, were by far the most abundant fish in all years. Bottom depth alone best explained assemblage structure in most years, but in others, bottom depth and water column temperature combined and percent sea\u2010ice coverage were most important. Abundance of T. chalcogramma larvae increases with water column temperature until 5\u00B0C and then becomes level. Higher abundances of Gadus macrocephalus (Pacific cod) larvae occur in years with the greatest percent sea\u2010ice cover as indicated by GAM analysis. Larvae of Lepidopsetta polyxystra (northern rock sole) increase in abundance with increasing maximum wind speed, but decrease at a later date during the last winter storm. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that oceanographic conditions, specifically water temperature and sea\u2010ice coverage, affect the spatial and temporal pattern of larval abundances. In general, ichthyoplankton species assemblages can be important early indicators of environmental change in the Bering Sea and potentially other subarctic seas as well.","publish_time":"2014-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Busby, M.

Over the years we have achieved relative success with the majority of these species. The maintenance and breeding of duikers has proved to be difficult at best. The major problems that we have experienced concern diet, stress\u2010related medical conditions, neonatal mortality, and postanesthetic pneumonia. As concentrate selectors, duikers have a diet relatively low in fiber, a well\u2010developed ability to forage selectively, a rumen bypass that is functionally important, a rapid passage and high fermentation rate for starch, and frequently encountered toxins. From an examination of the captive diet of duikers it is evident that the domestic fruits fed to duikers in captivity are not well suited for them. Duikers are highly susceptible to the slightest amount of stress. The group size in which duikers are managed has proved to be critical in the successful management of these species. In our earlier years of duiker management we often kept five or more animals together in a single exhibit. This would at times result in stress\u2010related jaw abscesses. Our group size has since been reduced to no more than three animals in any one exhibit. Since 1977, the Los Angeles Zoo has had 92 duiker births. The survival rate past 6 months of age has been 61%. Of the 36 neonatal deaths, 42% were stillborn or died within a few hours of birth. Hypothermia and maternal neglect have been linked to infant mortality. Duikers are also easily prone to capture myopathy and regurgitation during anesthesia or capture, which can often lead to aspiration pneumonia. If at all possible, the capture and restraint of a duiker should be avoided. However, there are times when the capture or restraint (chemically or manually) of a duiker is required.

Special attention is focussed on the shelduck and sheldgeese (Tadornini), perching duck (Cairinini), diving duck (Aythyini), sea duck (Mergini), eiders (Somateriini) and stifftails (Oxyurini). Two kinds of response could be distinguished at Slimbridge. In one, egg\u2010laying began sometime in spring, when daylengths reached a stimulatory level, and continued until the corresponding daylengths in summer or autumn were reached, that is, the egg\u2010laying season extended symmetrically on either side of the summer solstice. This is regarded as a \u201Cprimitive\u2010type\u201D response and is characteristic of phylogenetic lines which are thought to have evolved in, and radiated from, the tropics; the comb duck, muscovy duck, ringed teal and southern pochard are examples. The second kind of response was characterized by the cessation of egg\u2010laying when daylengths still remained stimulatory, that is, a characteristic photo\u2010refractoriness to long days developed, and egg\u2010laying occurred during the first half of the year at Slimbridge. We term this a \u201Ctemperate\u2010type\u201D response, and examples are provided by nearly all the sheldgeese and shelduck, by the mandarin, Carolina, white\u2010winged wood duck and all Aythya and the sea duck. Only a few examples of apparently intermediate breeding response were noted and these transitional species are discussed, for example the Andean goose, Abyssinian blue\u2010winged goose and Radjah shelduck. The egg\u2010laying cycles can be described as entrained rhythms and their phase angles measured in relation to seasonal daylength changes at Slimbridge. In Aythya, the onset of reproductive activity was strongly correlated with the latitude of origin whereas the end of breeding was not. This was because refractoriness developed at about the same time in all species, even though they began breeding in response to different photoperiods. For this reason, the length of breeding season expressed at Slimbridge was correlated with the midlatitude of the breeding range in the wild but even more strongly with the photoperiod under which egg\u2010laying was initiated. The onset of breeding in the sheldgeese and perching duck was not related to latitude, perhaps because species have had time to modify their ranges. However, the end of breeding in perching duck was related to latitude. Cessation of breeding corresponds to the onset of moult and the secretion of thyroid hormones. We suggest that as waterfowl radiated to higher latitudes their \u201Cbiological clocks\u201D became entrained to the new light regimes and a host of physiological functions were ordered in an adaptive rather than competitive sequence. It is because so many biological functions are liable to compete for scarce environmental energy supplies that some kind of endogenous partitioning is necessary. This endogenous component is seen when different species are kept under standard lighting conditions. It follows that the photo\u2010response of a species reflects its evolutionary history and so the discussion broaches zoogeographical and taxonomic topics. For example, it seems unlikely that the white\u2010winged wood duck evolved in the tropics, and likely that the sheldgeese and shelduck radiated from a post\u2010","publish_time":"2009-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murton1,\u2020, R.

Infections of the mucosal surfaces of the larynx, trachea, and bronchial tree account for the majority of all infections in this age group and can be associated with considerable morbidity and even mortality in certain populations. Many viral upper respiratory tract pathogens can also involve the middle and lower respiratory tract, particularly for children experiencing their first infection with the pathogen. Laryngitis may cause sore throat and hoarse voice but can also be associated with tracheitis and even bronchiolitis as the pathogen, infection, and host responses move further down the respiratory tree. Bronchiolitis may also occur as a separate infection in the lower airways presenting as respiratory distress in a young infant with prominent wheezing. Many respiratory viral diseases occur with seasonal patterns, with most cases occurring in the fall, winter, and early spring in temperate climates. In the tropics, some viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), may cause disease sporadically, year round, but epidemics still occur during \u201Crainy\u201D seasons. Bacterial infections can also involve the middle airway. Epiglottitis is a feared condition due to the potential for sudden airway obstruction. Fortunately, the diagnosis of epiglottitis has become quite rare since the introduction of routine childhood immunization against Haemophilus influenzae, serotype B, was once the most common cause of epiglottitis. Bacterial tracheitis can be a secondary bacterial infection following an acute viral infection of the trachea or a consequence of prolonged endotracheal intubation. While the mechanism of injury to the trachea is different, both processes lead to disruption of mucosal integrity, predisposing the patient to a tracheal infection caused by bacteria that normally only colonize the airway.","publish_time":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tristram, Debra","journal":"Introduction to Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b5cd2e0271351a1d6e9b383589d92b6e1e9f249.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153039.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153039/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory tree","lower respiratory tract","respiratory distress","respiratory viral diseases","separate infection","tracheal infection","Bacterial infections","acute viral infection","secondary bacterial infection","viral upper respiratory tract pathogens","respiratory syncytial virus","middle airway","common cause of epiglottitis","Bacterial tracheitis","lower airways","children","diagnosis of epiglottitis","bronchiolitis","sudden airway obstruction","common location","mucosal surfaces","bronchial tree account","disruption of mucosal integrity","Haemophilus influenzae","introduction of routine childhood immunization","early spring","winter","serotype B","potential","young infant","processes","majority","larynx","seasonal patterns","host responses","sore throat","mortality","considerable morbidity","fall","cases","consequence of prolonged endotracheal intubation","viruses","RSV","patient","infants","hoarse voice","certain populations","temperate climates","prominent wheezing","feared condition","Laryngitis","age group","mechanism of injury","epidemics","year","seasons","tropics"],"language":"en"},

Six are directed against antigens expressed on B lymphocytes (ibritumomab tiuxetan, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, and rituximab to CD20, brentuximab vedotin to CD30, and alemtuzumab to CD52); cetuximab, panitumumab, and necitumumab target EGFR; bevacizumab and ramucirumab are specific for VEGF and VEGFR2, respectively; pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and ado-trastuzumab target HER2; nivolumab and pembrolizumab are directed to the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1); and denosumab, ipilimumab, siltuximab, and dinutuximab recognize RANKL, CTLA-4, IL-6, and the disialoganglioside (GD2), respectively. In November 2015, the FDA approved daratumumab, the first anti-CD38 mAb and the first mAb to be approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Elotuzumab, targeted to the receptor SLAMF7, was also given approval for multiple myeloma soon after. Two antibodies are bispecific: the rat-mouse chimera, catumaxomab, recognizes both EpCAM and CD3, while blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell-engaging (BiTE) fusion protein, targets both CD19 and CD3. Although mAbs used for cancer immunotherapy are generally better tolerated than small molecule chemotherapeutic drugs, their range of adverse effects is still wide and varied from mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient rashes to severe cytopenias; anaphylaxis; autoimmunity; pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, kidney, neurological, and embryofetal toxicities; and rare life-threatening toxidermias. Because of their immunogenic potential, mAbs generally carry warnings of immune reactions, especially anaphylaxis, but the observed incidences of such reactions are actually quite small. Cytopenias occur in some patients treated with mAbs during anticancer immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms frequently remain unexplored. Type II and III hypersensitivities induced by mAbs may be underdiagnosed. Severe infusion reactions have been reported for all the mAbs although some show a much higher incidence with the chimeric rituximab and humanized trastuzumab antibodies being the leading offenders. Distinguishing features in the literature between cytokine release syndrome and severe infusion reactions are often not clear. At least ten of the currently approved mAbs for cancer therapy show some pulmonary toxicity. These pulmonary adverse events can be grouped into four categories: interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Cardiac adverse events, including congestive heart failure, decreased LVEF, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmias, have occurred with at least 11 of the mAbs. Papulopustular eruptions, cutaneous reactions that are not immune-mediated, as well as a range of other adverse mucocutaneous effects, are elicited in a large proportion of patients by mAbs targeted to EGFR. Other rare but mAb-induced serious adverse events are tumor lysis syndrome and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.","publish_time":"2016-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baldo, Brian A.","journal":"Safety of Biologics Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d105b1336bb2738bb184163af7dde5a5a217cd1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153453.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Elotuzumab"],"organizations":["EGFR","VEGF","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["approved mAbs","Cardiac adverse events","pulmonary adverse events","Severe infusion reactions","serious adverse events","range of adverse effects","cutaneous reactions","adverse mucocutaneous effects","warnings of immune reactions","severe cytopenias","humanized trastuzumab antibodies","anaphylaxis","cardiac arrest","pulmonary toxicity","monoclonal antibodies","FDA approved daratumumab","treatment of multiple myeloma","ado-trastuzumab target HER2","tumor lysis syndrome","cytokine release syndrome","necitumumab target EGFR","anti-CD38 mAb","bispecific T-cell","acute respiratory distress syndrome","chimeric rituximab","fusion protein","programmed cell death protein","interstitial pneumonitis","anticancer immunotherapy","cancer therapy","hypersensitivity pneumonitis","different antigens","rare life-threatening toxidermias","large proportion of patients","small molecule chemotherapeutic drugs","ARDS","congestive heart failure","decreased LVEF","myocardial infarction","ramucirumab","fibrosis","transient rashes","bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia","embryofetal toxicities","BOOP","obinutuzumab","mild gastrointestinal symptoms","bevacizumab","kidney","literature","pembrolizumab","autoimmunity","ibritumomab tiuxetan","progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy","CD30","alemtuzumab","catumaxomab","B lymphocytes","brentuximab vedotin","CD20","cetuximab","ofatumumab","VEGFR2","PD","targets","BiTE","panitumumab","nivolumab","blinatumomab","hepatic","rat-mouse chimera","RANKL","dinutuximab","siltuximab","CD52","underlying mechanisms","EpCAM","pertuzumab","approval","CD19","higher incidence","categories","leading offenders","Distinguishing features","receptor SLAMF7","CTLA","ipilimumab","denosumab","increasing number of cancers","arrhythmias","Papulopustular eruptions","immunogenic potential","observed incidences","total","disialoganglioside","Elotuzumab","hypersensitivities","GD2","Type"],"language":"en"},

Immune electron microscopy is the visualization of the reaction between an antigen, usually a virus, and an antibody and is used to detect either component of this reaction. Thus, the technique has been used to detect serological responses to such viruses as Norwalk virus. The technique has assisted in the identification of rubella virus and been diagnostically used to identify Hepatitis B virus infection and viruses associated with diarrhea.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chrystie, I.L.","journal":"Virology Methods Manual","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155430/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chapter","Norwalk virus","viruses","EM unit","identification of rubella virus","basic requirements","reaction","Hepatitis B virus infection","basic electron microscopic","sectioning procedures","detailed methodology","service requirements","negative staining procedures","Immune electron microscopy","general introduction","visualization","techniques","organization","sections","serological responses","principles","equipment","antigen","diarrhea","brief discussion","size","virology","component","Modifications","antibody","recipe"],"language":"en"},

Although, probably not as frequent in laboratory mouse colonies as it used to be, LDV infection may affect experimental results, primarily through its effects on the host immune responses. On the other hand, because of its unique properties, LDV infections serve as a good animal model for viral persistence, virally induced immunomodulation, and pathogenic infection of neurons in the central nervous system. However, the inability of LDV to infect in transformed cell lines and to cause a detectable cytopathic effect in cell cultures in which it replicates, such as mouse peritoneal exudate cells, represents technical obstacles to the further analysis of this virus. Identification of the cell receptor utilized by LDV would constitute a major advance, since this might lead to the creation of a cell line permissive to LDV infection. Whereas LDV is a natural and sometimes pathogenic infectious agent of the mouse, it does not currently represent a major threat to animal facilities. The virus is not very contagious and there are a number of easy methods available to detect infected mice. Moreover, further study of the interaction between relatively silent viruses, such as LDV, and their host species should lead to new insights into the mechanisms by which viruses can establish and maintain relatively harmless, persistent infections in their hosts.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coutelier, Jean-Paul; A.

Furthermore, it is important that consistency should be maintained during the production of viral vaccines; new lots of final product are prepared with frozen viral seed stocks that consistently reproduce the desired immunogenic and attenuation characteristics. To better appreciate the requirements for freezing and freeze drying of human and animal viruses, some consideration is given to understanding the structural and functional organization of this diverse group of microorganisms.

Emtricitabine represents one of the most potent anti-HIV agents identified to date, producing two log(10) drop in viral load as monotherapy at a 200 mg qd dose as the affected individual became susceptible to opportunistic infections and specific immune deficiency resulting from the depletion of CD4(\u002B) lymphocytes. The clinical profile of emtricitabine discussed in this chapter demonstrated (1) a plasma half-life of 8-10 hours with linear kinetics, (2) an intracellular emtricitabine 5\u2019-triphosphate half-life greater than 39 hours that supports daily dosing, (3) no significant drug\u2013drug interactions that limits the use of emtricitabine in combination therapy, (4) comparable safety and efficacy to lamivudine, and (5) low incidence of Ml84V mutations. This important observation suggests that emtricitabine can increase the durability of oxathiolane nucleoside analog-containing drug regimens. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) constitutes a major worldwide health threat, as the clinical development program is just entering the pivotal phase. Emtricitabine can be an extremely important drug for the treatment of patients coinfected with HIV and HBV.","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Painter, George R.; Rimsky, Laurence T.; Furman, Phillip A.; Liotta, Dennis C.; Schinazi, Raymond F.; Quinn, Joseph B.","journal":"Frontiers in Viral Hepatitis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155727/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs0MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of emtricitabine","intracellular emtricitabine","important drug","clinical profile of emtricitabine","drug interactions","drug regimens","significant drug","nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors","hours","HBV","protease inhibitors","treatment of patients","potent anti-HIV agents","plasma half-life","important observation","human immunodeficiency virus","clinical development program","triphosphate half-life greater","Hepatitis B virus","durability of oxathiolane nucleoside analog","opportunistic infections","affected individual","specific immune deficiency","NNRTI","major worldwide health threat","date","comparable safety","qd dose","combination therapy","monotherapy","lamivudine","depletion of CD4","low incidence of Ml84V mutations","efficacy","daily dosing","chapter","viral load","pivotal phase","classes of drugs","linear kinetics","lymphocytes"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the functional consequences of partial and full Sgta ablation in vivo using Cre-lox Sgta-null mice. Sgta(\u002B/\u2212) breeders generated viable Sgta(\u2212/\u2212) offspring, but at less than Mendelian expectancy. Sgta(\u2212/\u2212) breeders were subfertile with small litters and higher neonatal death (P \u003C 0.02). Body size was significantly and proportionately smaller in male and female Sgta(\u2212/\u2212) (vs WT, Sgta(\u002B/\u2212) P \u003C 0.001) from d19. Serum IGF-1 levels were genotype- and sex-dependent. Food intake, muscle and bone mass and adiposity were unchanged in Sgta(\u2212/\u2212). Vital and sex organs had normal relative weight, morphology and histology, although certain androgen-sensitive measures such as penis and preputial size, and testis descent, were greater in Sgta(\u2212/\u2212). Expression of AR and its targets remained largely unchanged, although AR localisation was genotype- and tissue-dependent. Generally expression of other TPR-containing proteins was unchanged. In conclusion, this thorough investigation of SGTA-null mutation reports a mild phenotype of reduced body size. The model\u2019s full potential likely will be realised by genetic crosses with other models to interrogate the role of SGTA in the many diseases in which it has been implicated.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Philp, Lisa K.; Day, Tanya K.; Butler, Miriam S.; Laven-Law, Geraldine; Jindal, Shalini; Hickey, Theresa E.; Scher, Howard I.; Butler, Lisa M.; Tilley, Wayne D.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b18ff7b65ed56a87c0c0de1ee312b8a0ddb51e4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4928056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4928056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sgta ablation","role of SGTA","female Sgta","viable Sgta","thorough investigation of SGTA","Cre-lox Sgta-null mice","Expression of AR","genotype","AR localisation","preputial size","breeders","sex-dependent","mild phenotype of reduced body size","regulator of androgen","small litters","null mutation","sex organs","tissue-dependent","certain androgen-sensitive measures","Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat","morphology","histology","normal relative weight","growth hormone receptor","bone mass","penis","higher neonatal death","testis descent","muscle","GHR","protein \u03B1","adiposity","Food intake","levels","models","targets","functional consequences of partial","genetic crosses","co-chaperone","Serum IGF","signalling","TPR","proteins","conclusion","model\u2019s","offspring","vs WT","diseases","Mendelian expectancy","d19"],"language":"en"},

Then, we will try to meet the second challenge of this special issue, by suggesting innovative approaches that will contribute to elaborate the building blocks of a theory of crisis management. We will propose a new theoretical framework, through the use of a fractal approach, following the footsteps of Benoit Mandelbrot, in order to rethink and capture the essence of the new theatre of operations that must be dealt with.

Direct ELISA was shown to be useless for differentiating NOA from HDOA. Immunoprecipitation in solution is time consuming and, moreover, whereas NAC(1) was shown to be specific for NOA compared with HDOA, DAC(1), NAC(2) and DAC(2) were shown not to be fully specific for HDOA. In contrast, by using as capture antibodies either NAC(3) or DAC(4), a sandwich ELISA can be designed which is fully specific for NOA or HDOA, respectively.

We recently reported that factor H binding by B. burgdorferi is due to inducible expression of several approximately 20 kDa plasmid\u2010encoded, surface\u2010exposed lipoproteins related to OspE (e.g. ErpA, ErpP and P21). In addition, a second class of factor H\u2010binding proteins of approximately 27\u201335 kDa has been described. The OspE\u2010related lipoproteins are dramatically induced by B. burgdorferi during transmission from its tick vector into the mammalian host. The induction of OspE\u2010related lipoproteins during mammalian infection may play a key a role in the borrelial evasion of the host\u0027s immune system. The goal of the present study was to define the factor H\u2010binding regions of OspE\u2010related proteins using mutagenesis, peptide mapping and surface plasmon resonance analysis (Biacore). The combined studies revealed that the C\u2010terminal regions of both human and mouse factor H (SCRs 18\u201320) specifically bind to OspE\u2010related lipoproteins. We also found FHR\u20101, whose C\u2010terminal SCRs 3\u20135 are homologous to SCRs 18\u201320 of factor H, to bind to OspE. Peptide mapping revealed five putative regions (designated I\u2010V) in OspE that could directly interact with factor H. Deleting the C\u2010terminal 15 amino acid residues from region V of P21 abolished its ability to bind factor H. At the same time, however, synthetic peptides corresponding to the C\u2010termini of OspE, P21 and ErpP did not inhibit factor H binding to OspE. Thus, the C\u2010terminal\u2010binding region V appears to be necessary but not sufficient for factor H binding. When a more specific mutation strategy was employed, where single amino acid residues in peptides spanning over the factor H\u2010binding regions were mutated to alanines, we observed that lysines in the factor H\u2010binding regions of OspE were required for factor H binding. The combined data have revealed that key lysine residues in OspE\u2010related lipoproteins and ionic interactions are crucial for factor H interactions. Furthermore, binding of OspE to the C\u2010termini of both mouse and human factor H suggests that Borrelia spirochetes utilize analogous complement resistance mechanisms in both rodents and man. In Borrelia garinii strains, which in in vitro analyses have been found to be sensitive to complement killing, differences in the OspE sequences as well as in the expression of factor H\u2010binding proteins may account for their susceptibility to serum lysis.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alitalo, A.; Meri, T.; Lankinen, H.; Cheng, Z.\u2010Z.; Jokiranta, S.; Sepp\u00E4l\u00E4, I.; Lahdenne, P.; Brooks, C.; Hefty, P.

The targeted epitopes are generated by a post\u2010translational modification catalysed by the calcium\u2010dependent enzyme peptidyl arginine deaminase that converts the positively charged arginine to polar but uncharged citrullin. The aim of this study was to analyse the presence of citrulline in the joints at different time points of collagen\u2010induced arthritis in DA rats by immunohistochemistry and to investigate how immunogenicity and arthritogenicity was affected by citrullination of rat serum albumin (RSA) and collagen type II (CII). Our results indicate that citrulline could be detected in joints of arthritic animals, first appearance at the onset of disease and increasing as disease progressed into a chronic state. Unimmunized animals or time points before clinical signs of arthritis were negative. By morphology, we state that some infiltrating macrophages as well as the cartilage surface stain positive for citrulline, while the major source of citrullinated proteins appears to be fibrin depositions. A specific Cit\u2010RSA T\u2010cell response was observed in animals challenged by citrullinated RSA, no response was recorded when RSA was used as a stimulus. The IgG analysis reveals not only a response towards the modified protein but also cross\u2010reactivity to native RSA. No T\u2010cell or B\u2010cell response was noted in animals injected with unmodified RSA. Cit\u2010CII induced a disease with higher incidence and earlier onset than did the native counterpart. We conclude that, in contrast to the human disease, citrulline does not seem to appear before clinical signs. As inflammation proceeds, citrulline is detected specifically in the joints. All other organs investigated were negative. We also conclude that citrullination of a protein can break tolerance and increase its arthritogenic properties.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lundberg, K.; Nijenhuis, S.; Vossenaar, E.; Venrooij, W.

We investigated the association between Plasmodium falciparum malaria and malnutrition in a cohort of children living on the coast of Kenya. The study involved longitudinal follow\u2010up for clinical malaria episodes and anthropometric measurements at four cross\u2010sectional surveys. We used Poisson regression analysis to investigate the association between malaria and nutritional status. Compared to baseline (children with a WAZ or HAZ score of \u2265\u22122), the crude incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for malaria in children with low HAZ or WAZ scores (\u003C\u22122) during the period prior to assessment were 1.17 (95% CI 0.91\u20131.50; 0 = 0.21) and 0.94 (0.71\u20131.25; 0.67), respectively, suggesting no association between malaria and the subsequent development of PEM. However, we found that age was acting as an effect modifier in the association between malaria and malnutrition. The IRR for malaria in children 0\u20132 years old who were subsequently characterized as wasted was 1.65 (1.10\u20132.20; P = 0.01), and a significant overall relationship between malaria and low\u2010HAZ was found on regression analysis when adjusting for the interaction with age (IRR 1.89; 1.01\u20133.53; P \u003C 0.05). Although children living on the coast of Kenya continue to suffer clinical episodes of uncomplicated malaria throughout their first decade, the association between malaria and malnutrition appears to be limited to the first 2 years of life.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nyakeriga, A.

The mechanisms underlying the observed reduction of EAE development in protected rats have not been fully clarified. We investigated immunological characteristics of lymphocytes after DNA vaccinaton and subsequent EAE induction. We confirm that protection was not associated with suppression of T1 cells, as transcription of the novel molecule rat T\u2010cell immunoglobulin\u2010 and mucin\u2010domain\u2010containing molecule (TIM\u20103), reported to be exclusively expressed on differentiated T1 cells, was not altered by DNA vaccination.

In protected rats, we observed (1) no alterations in antigen\u2010specific Th2 or Th3 responses, (2) reduced MHC II expression on splenocytes early after EAE induction, (3) antigen\u2010specific upregulation of IFN\u03B2 upon recall stimulation and (4) reduced IL\u201012R\u03B22 on lymphocytes.

A noncytolytic subset of NK cells may serve a regulatory role by secreting cytokines. Bacteria translocating across the gastrointestinal mucosa are presumed to gain access to NK cells, as consumption of certain lactic acid bacteria has been shown to increase in vivo NK cytotoxicity. Here, we investigated how human gut flora\u2010derived lactobacilli affect NK cells in vitro, by measuring proliferation and IFN\u2010\u03B3 production of human NK cells upon bacterial stimulation. CD3(\u2013)CD56(\u002B)NK cells were isolated from buffy coats by negative isolation using non\u2010NK lineage\u2010specific antibodies and magnetic beads. NK cells were incubated with 10\u03BCg/ml UV\u2010inactivated bacteria or 10\u03BCg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 4 days. Proliferation was assessed by incorporation of radioactive thymidine into NK\u2010cell DNA. The IFN\u2010\u03B3 concentration was measured by ELISA. Incubation of NK cells with a Lactobacillus acidophilus strain increased the proliferation of the NK cells and induced IFN\u2010\u03B3 production, both to levels comparable to PHA stimulation. The proliferative response was further enhanced with autologous monocytes present, probably because cytokines, secreted by monocytes having engulfed bacteria, stimulated the NK cells. In contrast, a Lactobacillus paracasei strain caused the NK cells to proliferate only in the presence of monocytes. These results demonstrate that various strains of lactobacilli have the capacity to activate NK cells in vitro, in a monocyte\u2010dependent or \u2010independent way. Hence, the encounter of NK cells with lactic acid bacteria will affect NK\u2010cell activation. Such activation of NK cells may potentially skew an on\u2010going or subsequent immune response towards a Th1 response.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fink, L. N.; Christensen, H.

Different respiratory specimens were collected from 540 patients from a period of December 2016 to May 2018 and were sent to the laboratory for molecular diagnosis. RNAs were extracted and subsequently, a multiplex real time PCR identifying flu A, flu B and typing flu A (H1N1) was carried out. The mean age of patients was 47.54\u00B123.96. 216 (40%) and 321 (60%) of subjects were male and female, respectively. 219 out of 540 (40.5%) were positive for influenza infection including flu A (n=97, 44.3%), flu A (H1N1) (n=45, 20.7%) and flu B (n=77, 35%). Flu A was the dominant species on 2016-2017 and flu B was the major species on 2017-2018. Flu A (H1N1) was comparable in both time periods. Flu infections were most frequently diagnosed in age groups 21-40. Flu-positive patients suffered more from body pain and sore throat than flunegative patients with significant statistical difference (P values \u003C0.001). The mean duration of hospitalization was shorter for flu-positive patients (P value = 0.016). Application of multiplex real time PCR could facilitate the influenza diagnosis in a short period of time, benefiting patients from exclusion of bacterial infections and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Influenza diagnosis was not achieved in up to 60% of flu-like respiratory infections, suggesting the potential benefit of adopting the same methodology for assessing the involvement of other viral or/and bacterial pathogens in those patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Azhar, Iman Rezaee; Mohraz, Minoo; Mardani, Masoud; Tavakoli, Mohammad Ali; Afshar, Amin Ehteshami; Zamani, Mohammad; Sadeghpoor, Simin; Safari, Saeid; Dadashpoor, Roozbeh; Rezaee, Mahsa; Shirvani, Fariba; Azimi, Shohreh; Heydarifard, Zahra; Ranjbar, Hamidreza Hagh; Lotfi, Amir Hossain; Mosadegh, Farhad; Hashemnejad, Farhad; Jazayeri, Seyed Mohammad","journal":"Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbe09a7acdb119530c01d0482050ae0f5f70d5d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171471.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171471/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["Flu infections","flu B","Flu-positive patients","flu seasons","common flu species","flunegative patients","hospitalized patients","mean age of patients","diagnosis of influenza infections","influenza diagnosis","respiratory infections","time periods","H1N1","Application of multiplex real time PCR","short period of time","molecular diagnosis","exclusion of bacterial infections","bacterial pathogens","detection of respiratory viruses","major species","dominant species","Different respiratory specimens","use of multiplex real-time technique","P values","single reaction","age groups","capability of simultaneous detection of various pathogens","mean duration of hospitalization","introduction of polymerase chain reaction","significant statistical difference","sore throat","body pain","techniques","Iran","Laleh hospital","unnecessary antibiotic therapy","potential benefit","technology","methodology","subjects","female","study","involvement","laboratory","aim","RNAs"],"language":"en"},

The microbiological quality of laboratory animals is a direct result of colony management practices and monitoring provides an after-the-fact assessment of the adequacy of those practices. Monitoring is, therefore, of greatest value in connection with the maintenance of animals in isolation systems where vigorous microbiological control is applied. In addition to constructive measures, an appropriate management system is necessary for the prevention of infections, as well as for their detection and control. It is a major task for the management of an animal facility to understand the way micro-organisms might be introduced or spread under the specific conditions given. The management of all animal facilities in an institution is best centralized. This warrants that all information dealing with the purchase of animals, the use of experimental materials and equipment and the performance of animal experiments flows through one office. This reduces the opportunity for the failures of communication. Centralized management can best establish comprehensive monitoring programs to evaluate important risk factors, such as animals and biological materials, before they are introduced into a facility.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mossmann, Horst; Nicklas, Werner; Hedrich, Hans J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172895/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs1Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Centralized"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Centralized management","management of immunocompromised","maintenance of animals","purchase of animals","infected animals","appropriate management system","animal facility","microbiological quality of laboratory animals","direct result of colony management practices","animal facilities","comprehensive monitoring programs","performance of animal experiments","vigorous microbiological control","biological materials","use of experimental materials","equipment","important risk factors","isolation systems","constructive measures","connection","institution","greatest value","addition","adequacy","prevention of infections","information","way micro-organisms","fact assessment","major task","opportunity","failures of communication","office","chapter","specific conditions","warrants","detection"],"language":"en"},

One is the normal absence of products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) from neural tissue. Without these cell surface proteins, neural cells are protected from T cell-mediated immune surveillance.

Thus, although their origins are as separate as a virus and the self-determinant of a human or lower animal, two molecules\u0027 linear amino acid sequences or their conformational fits may be shared. Such molecular homologies between proteins occur frequently and likely play roles in the processing of viral proteins inside cells. The homologies shared between viruses and host cytoskeletal proteins likely indicate that shared determinants on cell linker proteins guided viral proteins along highways and stop points inside cells. Most importantly, these unexpected cross-reactivities have broad and major implications for understanding autoimmune disease. Molecular mimicry is detected either by using humoral or cellular immune components, that cross-react with two presumably unrelated protein structures, or by computer searches to match descriptions of proteins in storage banks. The use of both these approaches to define molecular mimicry and establish its potential role in autoimmune disease is the topic of this chapter.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oldstone, Michael B.A.; Schwimmbeck, Peter; Dyrberg, Thomas; Fujinami, Robert","journal":"Progress in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a9df55271455bc55868f31c77bd995dd34a59da.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173565/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["descriptions of proteins","Molecular mimicry","processing of viral proteins","cell linker proteins","host cytoskeletal proteins","molecular homologies","shared determinants","shared identity of molecules","autoimmune disease","cells","unexpected cross-reactivities","lower animal","molecules\u0027 linear amino acid sequences","highways","computer searches","major implications","potential role","self-determinant","disparate genes","conformational fits","unrelated protein structures","cellular immune components","topic","viruses","points","roles","storage banks","approaches","origins","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Viral epidemiology is the study of the factors that determine the frequency and distribution of viral diseases in an animal population. In the broadest sense, epidemiology may be viewed as a part of population biology, involving not only environmental factors but also genetic factors in both the virus and the host. The terms incidence and prevalence are used to describe quantitative aspects of the occurrence of infections in populations. The incidence of infection is defined as the proportion of a population contracting that infection during a specified period, whereas prevalence refers to the proportion infected at a particular point in time. The comparisons of incidence and prevalence at different times and places are made by relating the appropriate numerator to a denominator that may be as general as the total population of the animal species concerned or may be specified as the susceptible population at risk. A disease is said to be enzootic when there are continuous chains of transmission in the region involved; epizootics are peaks in disease incidence. The size of the peak required to constitute an epizootic is arbitrary and is related to the background enzootic rate, the morbidity, and the anxiety that the disease arouses.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

Traditionally, qualifying the aetiology of CAP proved to be fraught with challenges particularly due to low yields from blood and sputum specimens. In recent years however, new advances in techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction have dramatically improved detection rates of both bacteria and viruses. In addition to qualifying the true burden of disease by known organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae it has led to the identification of organisms such as human bocavirus which have not previously been associated with CAP. This article aims to provide a brief update to the clinician on the current epidemiology of CAP in this post-vaccination era. It is based on a combination of recommendations from existing clinical practice guidelines, recent systematic reviews and the current literature.","publish_time":"2012-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manikam, Logan; Lakhanpaul, Monica","journal":"Paediatr Child Health (Oxford)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fa9fcf21e22c09aba624dbcf0586aada89e520f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recent advances","recent years","current epidemiology of CAP","aetiology of CAP","recent systematic reviews","new advances","current literature","identification of organisms","polymerase chain reaction","existing clinical practice guidelines","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","vaccine therapy","childhood community","improved detection rates","techniques","low yields","clinician","combination of recommendations","major cause of morbidity","mortality","blood","sputum specimens","bacteria","true burden of disease","challenges","post-vaccination era","prevention","brief update","viruses","human bocavirus","Streptococcus pneumoniae","efforts","developing world","article"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to verify the indications of nCPAP used in the paediatric emergency department (PED) at the Ambroise Par\u00E9 Hospital compared to those used in the PICU and to evaluate the efficiency of nCPAP to stabilize the respiratory function of infants with acute severe bronchiolitis before medicalized transport to the PICU. PROCEDURE: A retrospective French study was conducted on infants with severe bronchiolitis ventilated by nCPAP in the PED at the Ambroise Par\u00E9 Hospital, from winter 2009 to winter 2011. RESULTS: Out of the 31 infants, 16% were formerly prematurely born with otherwise no significant medical history. Postnatal age was 2 months. The rate of nCPAP performed for apneas (single indication of nCPAP for severe bronchiolitis according to the 2006 French medical consensus) was 17%. At least two indications of nCPAP used in the PICU were found for every patient. Babies were transferred within 2 h of nCPAP to the PICU. Clinical improvement was already observed with significantly slower respiratory rate and normalization of capnia and pH (P \u003C 0.001) and without any complication at the PED. NCPAP was pursued in the PICU in 84% of the cases. The average duration of nCPAP was of 2.7 days, with the duration of hospitalization in the PICU of 4.2 days. CONCLUSION: The nCPAP is a useful respiratory support technique which is easy to implement in the PED.","publish_time":"2014-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lopes, A. -A.; Sznajder, M.; Chevallier, B.; Soussan, V.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58f2c1fe2acb4c01f0df614bc9b1c96b52939054.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149108/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICU","PED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rate of nCPAP","indications of nCPAP","h of nCPAP","efficiency of nCPAP","average duration of nCPAP","single indication of nCPAP","PED","acute severe bronchiolitis","respiratory function of infants","slower respiratory rate","Ambroise Par\u00E9 Hospital","medicalized transport","winter","days","retrospective French study","French medical consensus","useful respiratory support technique","duration of hospitalization","paediatric emergency department","significant medical history","paediatric intensive care units","Nasal continuous positive airway pressure","normalization of capnia","PICUs","INTRODUCTION","apneas","pH","PROCEDURE","Postnatal age","months","CONCLUSION","Clinical improvement","Babies","complication","RESULTS","cases","patient"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we undertook a farm survey in Finland employing a choice experiment to study the willingness to pay for animal disease insurance products. We found that producers\u2019 willingness to pay for animal disease insurance is relatively low, even if consequential losses are covered. However, attributes of the insurance products which increased the likelihood of the producer wishing to purchase the product in a statistically significant manner were identified. The most important attribute was a low deductible. Using latent class analysis, four classes of producers were identified, those who were (1) not interested, (2) weakly interested or (3) strongly interested in insurance, and additionally, (4) a group who emphasised biosecurity measures but was not willing to purchase insurance. Those primarily interested in insurance were typically young, well-educated producers from large farms, and they already had a good level of biosecurity on their farms. However, the majority of the respondents preferred not to purchase insurance. The analysis suggests that commercial production animal disease insurance may need to be subsidised or otherwise made more attractive to producers, and even so, many producers might consider it unnecessary.","publish_time":"2016-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heikkil\u00E4, Jaakko; Niemi, Jarkko K.; Heinola, Katriina; Liski, Eero; Myyr\u00E4, Sami","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0da7f72b0d886b97f4b3d388d23e0d2ff2e4826.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149207/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Finland"],"keyphrases":["animal disease insurance products","Animal disease insurance plays","commercial production animal disease insurance","animal production","animal diseases","well-educated producers","classes of producers","study","public activities","producers\u2019 willingness","large farms","low deductible","biosecurity measures","public compensation schemes","latent class analysis","good level of biosecurity","minor role","Europe","strong faith","farm survey","choice experiment","Finland","current situation","important attribute","likelihood","significant manner","group","consequential losses","respondents","attributes","majority"],"language":"en"},

Prompt diagnosis is critical because TAFRO syndrome is a progressive and life threating disease. Some cases are refractory to immunosuppressive treatments. Renal impairment is frequently observed in patients with TAFRO syndrome, and some severe cases require hemodialysis. Histological evaluation is important to understand the pathophysiology of TAFRO syndrome. However, systemic histopathological evaluation through autopsy in TAFRO syndrome has been rarely reported previously. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Japanese man with chief complaints of fever and abdominal distension was diagnosed with TAFRO syndrome through imaging studies, laboratory findings, and pathological findings on cervical lymph node and bone marrow biopsies. Interleukin (IL)-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were remarkably elevated in both blood and ascites. Methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy was initiated on day 10, followed by combination therapy with PSL and cyclosporine A. However, the amount of ascites did not respond to the treatment. The patient became anuric, and continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated from day 50. However, the patient suddenly experienced cardiac arrest associated with myocardial infarction (MI) on the same day. Although the emergent percutaneous coronary intervention was successfully performed, the patient died on day 52, despite intensive care. Autopsy was performed to ascertain the cause of MI and to identify the histopathological characteristics of TAFRO syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial peritonitis, systemic cytomegalovirus infection, and Trichosporon asahii infection in the lungs were observed on autopsy. In addition, sepsis-related myocardial calcification was suspected. Management of infectious diseases is critical to reduce mortality in patients with TAFRO syndrome. Although the exact cause of MI could not be identified on autopsy, we considered embolization by fungal hyphae as a possible cause. Endothelial injury possibly caused by excessive secretion of IL-6 and VEGF contributed to renal impairment. Fibrotic changes in anterior mediastinal fat tissue could be a characteristic pathological finding in patients with TAFRO syndrome.","publish_time":"2018-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hibi, Arata; Mizuguchi, Ken; Yoneyama, Akiko; Kasugai, Takahisa; Kamiya, Keisuke; Kamiya, Keisuke; Ito, Chiharu; Kominato, Satoru; Miura, Toshiyuki; Koyama, Katsushi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d718380d5adcdd85e7a6db33f9969d129211768.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149248/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TAFRO","PSL"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["pathophysiology of TAFRO syndrome","histopathological characteristics of TAFRO syndrome","day","autopsy","patients","Renal impairment","renal failure","systemic histopathological evaluation","exact cause of MI","continuous renal replacement therapy","pathological findings","systemic cytomegalovirus infection","VEGF","pulse therapy","combination therapy","possible cause","ascites","systemic inflammatory disorder","laboratory findings","myocardial infarction","Endothelial injury","severe cases","Histological evaluation","chief complaints of fever","characteristic pathological finding","Trichosporon asahii infection","life threating disease","excessive secretion of IL","vascular endothelial growth factor","sepsis-related myocardial calcification","unique clinicopathological variant of idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease","cervical lymph node","anterior mediastinal fat tissue","reticulin myelofibrosis","anasarca","abdominal distension","mortality","year-old Japanese man","bone marrow biopsies","experienced cardiac arrest","imaging studies","Fibrotic changes","levels","Bacterial peritonitis","thrombocytopenia","anuric","fungal hyphae","addition","CONCLUSIONS","embolization","lungs","Prompt diagnosis","Management of infectious diseases","emergent percutaneous coronary intervention","immunosuppressive treatments","Methylprednisolone","mPSL","cyclosporine","BACKGROUND","CASE PRESENTATION","blood","hemodialysis","intensive care","Interleukin"],"language":"en"},

The virions of the Betatetravirus genus are nonenveloped, roughly spherical, of about 40 nm in diameter and exhibit T = 4 icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry. The genome consists of ssRNA and the viruses in the genus Betatetravirus have monopartite genomes. Betatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and has three distinct types of genomic organization. Most of the members of the group are serologically interrelated but distinguishable. The majority of the isolates were identified on the basis of their serological reaction with antiserum raised against N\u03B2V. All the virus species were isolated from Lepidoptera species (moths and butterflies), principally from Saturniid, Limacodid, and Noctuid moths, and no replication in other animals has been detected. In larvae, virus replication is restricted predominantly to the cells of the midgut. With the exception of PrV, no infections by members of the Betatetravirus genus have been achieved in cultured cells, even when gRNA was transfected directly into cells. At high host densities, horizontal spread appears to be the major route of infection. Suggestive evidence exists for vertical transmission, which could be responsible for the observed persistence of tetraviruses within insect populations. The viruses replicate primarily in the cytoplasm of gut cells of several Lepidoptera species. The virons of omegatetravirus genus are nonenveloped, roughly spherical, about 40 nm in diameter and exhibit T = 4 icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry. Unlike viruses in the genus Betatetravirus, viruses in the genus Omegatetravirus have bipartite genomes. As with the betatetraviruses, omegatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and studies in tissue culture cells show that the HaSV replicase is localized within the cytoplasm and associates with membranes derived from the endocytic pathway.","publish_time":"2011-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Virus Taxonomy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149323.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149323/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Betatetravirus genus","genus Betatetravirus","genus Omegatetravirus","cytoplasm of gut cells","virons of omegatetravirus genus","cultured cells","Lepidoptera species","virus species","Betatetraviruses replicate","tissue culture cells","exhibit T","icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry","diameter","nm","virus replication","members","omegatetraviruses replicate","Noctuid moths","bipartite genomes","monopartite genomes","studies","horizontal spread","observed persistence of tetraviruses","infections","HaSV replicase","basis","serological reaction","antiserum","vertical transmission","high host densities","insect populations","Saturniid","membranes","butterflies","distinct types of genomic organization","Suggestive evidence","major route of infection","N\u03B2V","Limacodid","associates","ssRNA","gRNA","endocytic pathway","exception of PrV","chapter","Tetraviridae family","isolates","group","larvae","virions","majority","animals","midgut"],"language":"en"},

Monocytes play an important role in the initiation and resolution of inflammation, and their diverse functions can be attributed to specific cellular subsets: pro-inflammatory or classical monocytes (Ly6cHi) and pro-reparative or non-classical monocytes (Ly6cLo). We hypothesized that inherent differences in Ly6cHi classical monocytes and Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes determine susceptibility to perinatal hepatic inflammation in late gestation fetuses and neonates. We found an anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile expressed by Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes, and a physiologic abundance of these cells in the late gestation fetal liver. Unlike neonatal pups, late gestation fetuses proved to be resistant to rhesus rotavirus (RRV) mediated liver inflammation. Furthermore, neonatal pups were rendered resistant to RRV-mediated liver injury when Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes were expanded. Pharmacologic inhibition of Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes in this setting restored susceptibility to RRV-mediated disease. These data demonstrate that Ly6cLo monocytes promote resolution of perinatal liver inflammation in the late gestation fetus, where there is a physiologic expansion of non-classical monocytes, and in the neonatal liver upon experimental expansion of these cells. Therapeutic strategies directed towards enhancing Ly6cLo non-classical monocyte function may mitigate the detrimental effects of perinatal liver inflammation.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alkhani, Anas; Levy, Claire S; Tsui, Margaret; Rosenberg, Katherine A; Polovina, Katya; Mattis, Aras N; Mack, Matthias; Van Dyken, Steven; Wang, Bruce M; Maher, Jacquelyn J; Nijagal, Amar","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64158-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346042/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ly6cLo monocytes","Ly6cHi classical monocytes","physiologic expansion of non-classical monocytes","Pharmacologic inhibition of Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes","Ly6cLo non-classical monocyte function","resolution of perinatal liver inflammation","neonatal liver","Perinatal hepatic inflammation","resolution of inflammation","late gestation fetal liver","detrimental effects of perinatal liver inflammation","late gestation fetuses","RRV-mediated liver injury","neonatal pups","RRV-mediated disease","susceptibility","cells","physiologic abundance","experimental expansion","setting","specific cellular subsets","rhesus rotavirus","anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile","inherent differences","diverse functions","initiation","important role","devastating consequences","neonates","Therapeutic strategies","data"],"language":"en"},

CPIP can have several causes. In this study, we aimed to show that 3D-iron loaded mesh preparations are useful in radiological evaluation of post-operative complications, especially patients with chronic pain and the mesh status of operated inguinal hernia cases. METHODS A total of 450 cases who had been operated for inguinal hernia with 3D-iron loaded mesh and who had ongoing pain at the post-operative period were included in this study. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) was performed at the post-operative 90th day of the seven symptomatic (groin pain, limitation of movement) cases which were operated using a 3D-iron loaded mesh, 10 \u00D7 15 cm in size, (DynaMeshEndolap visible with 25% MRI-visible filaments, FEG TextiltechnikmbH, Aachen, Germany) for inguinal hernia repair to evaluate mesh status, localization, and local complications. Gradient echo sequences in the sagittal, axial, and coronal sections on MRI were discussed by two radiologists. Mesh localizations, their relationship with surrounding structures and their complications related with mesh were evaluated by two radiologists (D.Y, D.E.T.\u015E). RESULTS No significant radiological findings related to defined anatomical structures were found in the MRI images of the study group. The dimensions measured on the sagittal, axial and coronal images were correlated with original mesh sizes and no significant shrinkage was detected. CONCLUSION Mesh position and deformation as shrinkage can be the mesh-related cause of pain. The incidence of CPIP in our patients is less than 2%. 3D-iron loaded meshes were monitored with MRI in CPIP patients and there was no mesh-related changes found in our study. The use of MRI-visible meshes will most likely help us to monitor mesh preparations and show potential time-dependent changes in mesh characteristics and consequent complications. In case of doubtful clinical postoperative hernia recurrence or chronic groin pain, mesh position can be identified by MRI and unnecessary surgical intervention can be avoided.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6zveri, E; \u015Eanl\u0131, D E T; Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, D; G\u00F6k, H; Ertem, M","journal":"Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-020-02168-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32166710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["mesh characteristics","Mesh localizations","mesh-related changes","mesh-related cause of pain","D-iron loaded mesh preparations","CONCLUSION Mesh position","original mesh sizes","mesh status of operated inguinal hernia cases","chronic pain","MRI images","chronic groin pain","ongoing pain","use of MRI","PURPOSE Chronic post-operative inguinal pain","inguinal hernia repair","MRI-visible filaments","CPIP patients","radiological evaluation of post-operative complications","post-operative period","incidence of CPIP","laparoscopic hernia repair","consequent complications","local complications","study group","coronal images","significant shrinkage","DynaMeshEndolap visible","radiologists","case of doubtful clinical postoperative hernia recurrence","significant radiological findings","anatomical structures","surrounding structures","coronal sections","potential time-dependent changes","Aachen","FEG TextiltechnikmbH","Germany","relationship","deformation","limitation of movement","day","Gradient echo sequences","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","unnecessary surgical intervention","METHODS","total","dimensions","months","causes"],"language":"en"},

This study attempts to ascertain the influence of stem stiffness on peri-prosthetic bone formation and stress shielding when in silico models of solid CoCr alloy and Ti alloy stems, and porous Ti stems (53.8 GPa and 31.5 GPa Young\u0027s moduli) were implanted. A tissue differentiation predictive mechanoregulation algorithm was employed to estimate the evolutionary bond between bone and stem interfaces with 0.5-mm- and 1-mm-thick calluses. The results revealed that the high stiffness stems yielded higher stress shielding and lower micromotions than that of low stiffness stems. Contrarily, bone formation around solid Ti alloy stem and porous Ti 53.8 GPa stem was augmented in 0.5-mm- and 1-mm-thick calluses, respectively. All designs of stems exhibited different rates of bone formation, diverse initial micromotions and stress shielding; however, long-term bone formation was coherent with different stress shielding. Therefore, contemplating the secondary stability of the stems, low stiffness stem (Ti 53.8 GPa) gave superior biomechanical performance than that of high stiffness stems.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehboob, Hassan; Ahmad, Furqan; Tarlochan, Faris; Mehboob, Ali; Chang, Seung Hwan","journal":"Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10237-020-01334-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GPa stem","Ti alloy stems","porous Ti stems","high stiffness stems","low stiffness stems","influence of stem stiffness","solid Ti alloy stem","designs of stems","stem interfaces","long-term bone formation","different rates of bone formation","different stress shielding","peri-prosthetic bone formation","higher stress shielding","coated porous section of stem surface","lower micromotions","GPa Young\u0027s moduli","thick calluses","diverse initial micromotions","silico models of solid CoCr alloy","secondary stabilities","evolutionary bond","secondary stability","superior biomechanical performance","tissue differentiation predictive mechanoregulation algorithm","phenomenon attributes","trade-off","transfers stresses","osseointegration process","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Using an exploratory approach, this study aimed to evaluate sex differences in neuromuscular responses and motor variability during a repetitive task performed on 3 days. METHODS Thirty women and 27 men performed the non-fatiguing, repetitive, 1-h screwing task. For neuromuscular responses, the mean and difference values of static, median, and peak percentile muscle activity levels (normalized to a reference voluntary contraction force) and, for motor variability, the mean and difference values of relative and absolute cycle-to-cycle variability across days were compared between both sexes for each muscle. A mixed-design analysis of variance was used to assess differences between both sexes. RESULTS The non-fatiguing character of the screwing task was confirmed by the absence of decreased force levels in maximal voluntary contractions performed before and after the task and by absence of electromyographic signs of muscle fatigue. The static and median muscle activity levels tended to be higher among women (on average 7.86 and 27.23 %RVE) than men (on average 6.04 and 26.66 %RVE). Relative motor variability of the flexor and biceps muscles and absolute motor variability of both upper arm muscles were lower in women (on average 0.79 and 29.70 %RVE) than in men (on average 0.89 and 37.55 %RVE). The median activity level of both upper arms muscles tended to decrease within days among women (on average - 2.63 %RVE) but increase among men (on average \u002B 1.19 %RVE). Absolute motor variability decreased within days among women (on average - 5.32 to - 0.34%RVE), whereas it tended to decrease less or increase within days among men (on average - 1.21 to \u002B 0.25 %RVE). CONCLUSION Women showed higher levels of muscle activity and lower initial relative and absolute motor variability than males when performing the same occupational task, implying women may have a higher risk for developing disorders and point to both sexes using different intrinsic motor control strategies in task performance. Clearly, biological aspects alone cannot explain why women would be at higher risk for developing disorders than men. Therefore, a wider range of individual and environmental factors should be taken into account for optimizing work station designs and organizations by taking into account sex differences.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luger, Tessy; Seibt, Robert; Rieger, Monika A; Steinhilber, Benjamin","journal":"Biology of sex differences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-020-0282-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31992365/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["average","RVE","absolute motor variability","Relative motor variability","cycle variability","implying women","CONCLUSION Women","days","aspects of motor control","higher levels of muscle activity","median muscle activity levels","repetitive task","task performance","occupational task","peak percentile muscle activity levels","absolute cycle","higher risk","h screwing task","sexes","different intrinsic motor control strategies","median activity level","absence of decreased force levels","neuromuscular responses","difference values of relative","account sex differences","upper arm muscles","biceps muscles","upper arms muscles","difference values of static","mean","absence of electromyographic signs of muscle fatigue","neuromuscular requirements","non-fatiguing character","BACKGROUND Musculoskeletal disorders","reference voluntary contraction force","biological aspects","maximal voluntary contractions","flexor","males","environmental factors","organizations","wider range of individual","study","mixed-design analysis of variance","work station","exploratory approach","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The existing antiviral drugs are limited, due to their inadequate response, increased rate of resistance and several adverse side effects. Therefore, one of the newly emerging field \u0022peptide-based therapeutics\u0022 against viruses is being explored and seems promising. Over the last few years, a lot of scientific effort has been made for the identification of novel and potential peptide-based therapeutics using various advanced technologies. Consequently, there are more than 60 approved peptide drugs available for sale in the market of United States, Europe, Japan, and some Asian countries. Moreover, the number of peptide drugs undergoing the clinical trials is rising gradually year by year. The peptide-based antiviral therapeutics have been approved for the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Influenza virus and Hepatitis virus (B and C). This review enlightens the various peptide sources and the different approaches that have contributed to the search of potential antiviral peptides. These include computational approaches, natural and biological sources (library based high throughput screening) for the identification of lead peptide molecules against their target. Further the applications of few advanced techniques based on combinatorial chemistry and molecular biology have been illustrated to measure the binding parameters such as affinity and kinetics of the screened interacting partners.

Very little is known about pandemic management and effects on other services, including delivery of surgery. METHODS This was a scoping review of all available literature pertaining to COVID-19 and surgery, using electronic databases, society websites, webinars and preprint repositories. RESULTS Several perioperative guidelines have been issued within a short time. Many suggestions are contradictory and based on anecdotal data at best. As regions with the highest volume of operations per capita are being hit, an unprecedented number of operations are being cancelled or deferred. No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care). No recommendations exist regarding how to reopen surgical delivery. The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak. Surgical delivery, owing to its cross-cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning. CONCLUSION Patients are being deprived of surgical access, with uncertain loss of function and risk of adverse prognosis as a collateral effect of the pandemic.

The scientific community is actively exploring treatments that would potentially be effective in combating COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. In malarial pandemic countries, chloroquine is widely used to treat malaria. In malarial non-pandemic nations, chloroquine is not widely used. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action. The aim of this study was to indirectly investigate the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 by determining the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic nations. We sought evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that these drugs could show efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed in vitro studies, in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports, that were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The studies on \u0022COVID-19 and its allied treatment were found from World Health Organization (WHO), ISI-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries. The search was based on keywords: antiviral drugs, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment modalities, and coronavirus. In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic countries. The review and analyses were performed on March 28, 2020. RESULTS For this study, we identified a total of 09 published articles: 03 clinical trials with sample size 150; 03 in vitro studies and 03 expert consensus reports. These studies were all suggestive that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can successfully treat COVID-19 infections. We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro. The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. People are currently using these drugs for malaria. It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meo, S A; Klonoff, D C; Akram, J","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202004_21038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373993/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["malaria pandemic","treatment of COVID","Hydroxychloroquine","prevalence of COVID","non-pandemic countries","efficacy of chloroquine","malarial pandemic countries","malarial non-pandemic nations","CONCLUSIONS Chloroquine","antiviral activities of chloroquine","antiviral drugs","clinical trials","original studies","allied treatment","treatment modalities","clinical trial registries","World Health Organization","antiviral characteristics","SARS-CoV","hypothesis","study","infections","global health crisis","expert consensus reports","entire world","great public health concerns","replication of SARS","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Google Scholar","PubMed","EMBASE","Scopus","similar chemical structures","Science","OBJECTIVE","effectiveness","ISI-Web","mechanisms of action","published articles","sample size","keywords","treatments","total","hypothetical benefit","scientific community","search","MATERIALS","METHODS","findings","review","analyses","aim","RESULTS","evidence","addition","People"],"language":"en"},

LANCET figured out that the 2019-nCoV is closely related to \u0022cytokine storm\u0022. \u0022Cytokine storm\u0022 is an excessive immune response of the body to external stimuli such as viruses and bacteria. As the virus attacking the body, it stimulates the secretion of a large number of inflammatory factors: interleukin(IL), interferon(IFN), C-X-C motif chemokine(CXCL) and so on, which lead to cytokine cascade reaction. With the exudation of inflammatory factors, cytokines increase abnormally in tissues and organs, interfering with the immune system, causing excessive immune response of the body, resulting in diffuse damage of lung cells, pulmonary fibrosis, and multiple organ damage, even death. Arachidonic acid(AA) metabolic pathway is principally used to synthesize inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1(MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor(TNF), IL, IFN, etc., which is closely related to the occurrence, development and regression of inflammation. Therefore, the inhibition of AA metabolism pathway is benefit for inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors in the body and alleviating the \u0022cytokine storm\u0022. Based on the pharmacophore models of the targets on AA metabolic pathway, the traditional Chinese medicine database 2009(TCMD 2009) was screened. The potential herbs were ranked by the number of hit molecules, which were scored by pharmacophore fit value. In the end, we obtained the potential active prescriptions on \u0022cytokine storm\u0022 according to the potential herbs in the \u0022National novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan(trial version sixth)\u0022. The results showed that the hit components with the inhibitory effect on AA were magnolignan \u2160, lonicerin and physcion-8-O-\u03B2-D-glucopy-ranoside, which mostly extracted from Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Gardeniae Fructus, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Arctii Fructus, Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis Rhizoma, Paeoniaeradix Rubra, Dioscoreae Rhizoma.

Although antihypertensive drugs are widely available, in many patients blood pressure control to guideline-recommended target values is not achieved. Several device-based approaches have been introduced to lower blood pressure; most of these strategies aim to modulate autonomic nervous system activity. Clinical trials have moved from including patients with resistant hypertension receiving intensive pharmacological treatment to including patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in the presence or absence of antihypertensive medications. Renal sympathetic denervation is the most extensively investigated device-based therapy for hypertension, and randomized, sham-controlled trials have provided proof-of-principle data for its blood pressure-lowering efficacy. Unilateral electrical baroreflex activation, endovascular baroreflex amplification and pacemaker-mediated cardiac neuromodulation therapy have yielded promising results in observational trials, which need to be confirmed in larger, adequately powered, sham-controlled trials. Until further evidence becomes available, device-based therapy for hypertension should not be considered for routine treatment. However, when considering a device-based treatment for hypertension, the underlying pathophysiology in each patient has to be taken into consideration, and the procedural risks weighed against the cardiovascular risk attributable to the elevated blood pressure. This Review summarizes the pathophysiological rationale and the latest clinical evidence for device-based therapies for hypertension.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lauder, Lucas; Azizi, Michel; Kirtane, Ajay J; B\u00F6hm, Michael; Mahfoud, Felix","journal":"Nature reviews.

Vulnerable populations to this outbreak and its physical and mental health impact include community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Telehealth is becoming a potential major tool to deliver healthcare and support preventing the risk of exposure. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was threefold: 1) to explore the physical and mental health and well-being impact of confinement in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, 2) to provide TV-based and telephone-based health and social support, and 3) to study the effect of a TV-based assistive integrated technology (TV-AssistDem). METHODS A telephone-based survey was administered in Spain to 93 participants of the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from the 25th of March to 6th of April 2020. RESULTS 60(65%) respondents were women, aged 73. 34 (SD=6.07) and 69(74%) lived accompanied. Lockdown measures forced 17(18%) to change their living arrangements. Health status was found optimal in 89 (96%) with no COVID-19 symptoms. Grocery and pharmacy outings were done by family members in 68(73%). 57(61%) respondents reported overall well-being and 65(70%) maintained sleep. However, those living alone presented greater negative feelings and sleeping problems. Regarding leisure activities, 53(57%) went on walks, 32(35%) did memory games, 55(60%) watched TV, and 91(98%) telephone called relatives. 58(64%) respondents reported accessing moderately or too much COVID-19 information, using 89(97%) Television sets, and 56 (62%) stated understanding this information in extreme. 39(39%) respondents had contacted health and social services whilst 29(31%) requested information regarding these services during the telephone call. Regarding differences between the intervention and control group there were no significant differences in health and well-being. Respondents with TV-AssistDem did more memory exercises (52% vs. 17.4%; P\u003C.001) than controls. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that during the coronavirus disease confinement the physical and mental health and well-being of our vulnerable population at risk was overall optimal. However, those living alone reported greater psychological negative impact and sleeping problems. Measures adopted to face the negative experience of confinement included: keeping well informed of the situation and accessing health and social services, counting with a support network which prevented risk of exposure to COVID-19 and guaranteed food and medical supplies, a daily routine with maintained sleeping habits and leisure activities, staying physically and mentally active with cognitive stimulation exercises, and ensuring social connectedness using technologies. Television sets stood out as preferred technological devices to access COVID-19 information, watch TV as a recreational activity, and do memory exercises as an intellectual activity. TV-based telehealth support using TV-AssistDem has demonstrated its potential in terms of cognitive stimulation.

Here, using transient and permanent loss-of-function approaches in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we reveal that although BMAL1 is dispensable for the maintenance of the pluripotent state, its depletion leads to deregulation of transcriptional programs linked to cell differentiation commitment. We further confirm that depletion of Bmal1 alters the differentiation potential of ESCs in vitro. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that BMAL1 participates in the regulation of energy metabolism maintaining a low mitochondrial function which is associated with pluripotency. Loss-of-function of Bmal1 leads to the deregulation of metabolic gene expression associated with a shift from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism. Our results highlight the important role that BMAL1 plays at the exit of pluripotency in vitro and provide evidence implicating a non-canonical circadian function of BMAL1 in the metabolic control for cell fate determination.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ameneiro, Cristina; Moreira, Tiago; Fuentes-Iglesias, Alejandro; Coego, Alba; Garcia-Outeiral, Vera; Escudero, Adriana; Torrecilla, Daniel; Mulero-Navarro, Sonia; Carvajal-Gonzalez, Jose Maria; Guallar, Diana; Fidalgo, Miguel","journal":"Life science alliance","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.201900534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32284354/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["depletion of Bmal1","non-canonical circadian function of BMAL1","pluripotent cells","function approaches","differentiated cells","adult stem cells","low mitochondrial function","mouse embryonic stem cells","differentiation potential of ESCs","regulation of circadian rhythms","regulation of energy metabolism","cell differentiation commitment","metabolic control","deregulation of metabolic gene expression","pluripotent state","great potential","oxidative metabolism","permanent loss","exit of pluripotency","deregulation of transcriptional programs","cell fate determination","shift","evidence","molecular underpinnings","maintenance","important role","regenerative medicine","results"],"language":"en"},

BACKGROUND The rapid diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 together with the need for isolation for infected patients might be responsible for a suboptimal treatment for SARS-CoV-2 ACS patients. Recently, the group of Sichuan published a protocol for COVID/ACS infected patients that see the thrombolysis as the gold standard of care. METHODS We enrolled 31 consecutive patients affected by SARS-COV-2 admitted to our emergencies room for suspected ACS. RESULTS All patients underwent urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when required except two patients with severe hypoxemia and unstable hemodynamic condition that were conservatively treated. Twenty-one cases presented diffuse ST-segment depression while in the remaining cases anterior and inferior ST-elevation was present in four and six cases, respectively. PCI was performed in all cases expect two that were diagnosed as suspected myocarditis because of the absence of severe coronary disease and three with apical ballooning at ventriculography diagnostic for Tako-Tsubo syndromes. Two patients conservatively treated died. The remaining patients undergoing PCI survived except one that required endotracheal intubation (ETI) and died at Day 6. ETI was required in five more patients while in the remaining cases CPAP was used for respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS Urgent PCI for ACS is often required in SARS-CoV-2 patients improving the prognosis in all but the most advanced patients.

AIMS To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a pilot multifactorial intervention to reduce potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use in older adults. METHODS We conducted a phase 2, feasibility, open-label study in the ambulatory setting of an integrated healthcare network in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We recruited primary care physicians (PCPs) and measured PIM use in a sample of their patients (65 years or older). Educational workshops for PCPs were organized with the involvement of clinician champions. Practical deprescribing algorithms were designed based on Beers criteria. Automatic email alerts based on specific PIMs recorded in each patient\u0027s electronic health record were used as a reminder tool. PCPs were responsible for deprescribing decisions. We randomly sampled 879 patients taking PIMs from eight of the most commonly used drug classes at our institution and compared basal (6 months prior to the intervention) and final (12 months after) prevalence of PIM use using a test of proportions. RESULTS There was a significant reduction (p \u003C 0.05) in all drug classes evaluated.

We characterized the plasma cytokine profiles in acute phase (0, 1, and 3 days after SCI) and subacute phase (7, 14, and 21 days after SCI) with microarray analysis. The motor function recovery following SCI was monitored by Olby scores. The expression level of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then, correlations with the Olby scores and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were performed. We identified 12 DEPs including 10 pro-inflammatory and 2 anti-inflammatory cytokines during the 21-day study period. Among those, the expression levels of erythropoietin (EPO), IL-17A, and IFN\u03B3 significantly correlated with the Olby scores with R2 values of 0.870, 0.740, and 0.616, respectively.

All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largelyremained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In thepresent study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that batSARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The proteinsequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher ascompared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutationsin the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of differentclades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acidchanges. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in thecoding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The nonsynonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed overdifferent hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important di-amino acid change RGto KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novelcoronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruseswhich may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behindfailure of the antiviral therapies.

Methods: The incidence data of COVID-19 reported in Shaanxi as of 22 February, 2020 were collected for an epidemiological descriptive analysis. Results: A total of 245 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Shaanxi. Most cases were mild (87.76%). As time passed, the areas where confirmed cases were reported continued to increase. The case number in Xi\u0027an was highest, accounting for nearly half of the total reported cases in the province. The epidemic pattern in Shaanxi had gradually shifted from imported case pattern to local case pattern, and the transmission of local cases was mainly based on family cluster transmission. The confirmed cases from different sources had caused the secondary transmission in Shaanxi. After February 7, the number of reported cases began to fluctuate and decrease stably, indicating a decrease-to-zero period. Conclusions: At present, the overall epidemic of COVID-19 in Shaanxi has gradually been mitigated. However, considering the approaching of return to work and study and the increasing of imported cases from other countries, the prevention and control of COVIS-19 in Shaanxi will face new challenges.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, N; Li, C; Ning, S S; Chen, S; Cao, L; Yang, G J; Li, X X; Nian, Y P; Wang, W H; Liu, Y Z; Wang, L; Lei, F L; Zhang, Y; Zhuang, G H","journal":"Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200225-00172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32244260/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shaanxi"],"keyphrases":["confirmed cases of COVID","total reported cases","number of reported cases","Shaanxi province","transmission of local cases","increasing of imported cases","imported case pattern","local case pattern","case number","epidemic pattern","incidence data of COVID","epidemiological characteristics of COVID","overall epidemic of COVID","secondary transmission","decrease","family cluster transmission","incidence trend","epidemiological descriptive analysis","study","countries","different sources","work","accounting","Xi\u0027an","prevention","present","control of COVIS","approaching of return","Methods","areas","Conclusions","Objective","time","new challenges","Results","period"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN A systematic search and review procedure was conducted of research reporting use and results of the PedsQL-TM with samples of pediatric heart, liver, kidney, and lung transplantation. Searches were conducted in nine scholarly databases and two additional sources to identify unpublished research. Multiple reviewers screened studies meeting inclusion criteria in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS A final sample of nine studies reported findings for the PedsQL-TM with pediatric organ transplant recipients. Most studies relied on either kidney or liver transplant recipients from single pediatric transplant centers. Factor validity of the PedsQL-TM and inter-rater reliability (IRR) between patients and parents have not been adequately determined. Internal consistency reliability was found as acceptable or excellent across multiple studies. PedsQL-TM scores were found to vary with other HRQOL issues, yet few studies examined their association with medication adherence or posttransplant health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS With the goal of enhancing and sustaining HRQOL in pediatric organ transplant recipients, the need for a psychometrically valid and reliable measure of transplant-specific HRQOL is apparent. Research on the PedsQL-TM supports the promise of this measure although future efforts should be taken to examine measurement issues such as factor validity and IRR. Assessing transplant-specific HRQOL in these patients is paramount for their care and appropriate decision-making by patients, families, and the transplant team.","publish_time":"2020-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Killian, Michael O; Triplett, Kelli N; Masood, Saba S; Boehler, Jason; Mayersohn, Gillian S","journal":"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-019-02398-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31894507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric transplant recipients","transplant-specific HRQOL","liver transplant recipients","pediatric organ transplant recipients","Transplant Module","transplant team","PedsQL-TM scores","single pediatric transplant centers","reliable measure of transplant","HRQOL issues","multiple studies","sustaining HRQOL","patients","samples of pediatric heart","kidney","IRR","Factor validity","unpublished research","results","research reporting use","disease-specific health-related quality of life","inter-rater reliability","Multiple reviewers","measurement issues","posttransplant health outcomes","Internal consistency reliability","review procedure","inclusion criteria","medication adherence","need","systematic search","additional sources","appropriate decision-making","accordance","extant empirical literature","care","association","families","promise","findings","STUDY DESIGN","scholarly databases","PRISMA guidelines","future efforts","lung transplantation","final sample","goal","assessment","Searches","parents","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) methodologies were used to determine the targeted OPs in the selected biological samples. Cleanup of extracts was performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using EZ-POP cartridges and detection by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (QqQ-MS/MS). The targeted OPs were detected with the following mean level total concentration order polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \u003E organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) \u003E non-dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDLPCBs) \u003E pyrethroids (PYRs) \u003E polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) \u003E dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (DLPCBs) \u003E organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) for placenta and \u03A3NDLPCBs \u003E \u03A3PAHs \u003E \u03A3OCPs \u003E \u03A3PYRs \u003E \u03A3OPPs \u003E \u03A3DLPCBs \u003E \u03A3PBDEs for meconium, respectively. Significant correlations (p \u003C .050) between the socio-demographic characteristics of the selected population (mother\u0027s parity, age, weight increase during pregnancy, place of living and smoking habits) and log transformed concentration of some of the targeted OPs (OCPs, PBDEs, PYRs, OPPs and PAHs) were detected. The results obtained shown the complementary information given by both biological samples selected. Nevertheless, additional research will be needed to gain an understanding of the trans-placental transfer of OPs, to choose the best biological matrix to evaluate the prenatal exposure to OPs in a correct way and to know their health implications.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fern\u00E1ndez-Cruz, Tania; \u00C1lvarez-Silvares, Esther; Dom\u00EDnguez-Vigo, Paula; Simal-G\u00E1ndara, Jes\u00FAs; Mart\u00EDnez-Carballo, Elena","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408211/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University Hospital","SPE"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["targeted OPs","effects of OPs","selected biological samples","trans-placental transfer of OPs","meconium samples","non-invasive biological samples","prenatal exposure","Human exposure","polychlorinated biphenyls","infants","best biological matrix","selected population","non-dioxin","organophosphorus pesticides","organochlorine pesticides","QqQ-MS","solid-phase extraction","vulnerability of human fetuses","University Hospital of Ourense","Selective pressurized liquid extraction","following mean level total concentration order polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","different physicochemical properties","age","cell differentiation","mother\u0027s parity","rapid growth","\u03A3PYRs","GC","detection","weight increase","EZ-POP cartridges","organ development","\u03A3OPPs","\u03A3OCPs","pyrethroids","tandem mass spectrometry","gas chromatography","uterine life period","polybrominated diphenyl ethers","pregnancy","SPLE","\u03A3DLPCBs","\u03A3PAHs","methodologies","\u03A3NDLPCBs","correct way","environmental organic pollutants","smoking habits","socio-demographic characteristics","delivery","mothers","\u03A3PBDEs","complementary information","immaturity of metabolism","northwestern Spain","present study","city","birth","understanding","Cleanup of extracts","health implications","Significant correlations","Epidemiological studies","aim","results","additional research"],"language":"en"},

A main drawback of using IEX for NOM removal is the production of spent IEX regeneration brine, a polluting waste that is expensive to discharge. In this work, we studied ceramic nanofiltration as a treatment for the spent NOM-rich brine, with the aim to reduce the volume of this waste and to recycle salt. Compared to polymeric nanofiltration, the fouling was limited. When NOM is rejected and concentrated, a clean permeate with the regeneration salt (NaCl) could be produced and reused in the IEX regeneration process. Bench scale studies revealed that NOM could be effectively separated from the NaCl solution by steric effects. However, the separation of NaCl from other salts present in the brine, such as Na2SO4, was not sufficient for reuse purposes. The low sulphate rejection was mainly due to the low zeta potential of the membrane at the high ionic strength of the brine.

The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from non-lung clinical specimens, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in autopsy specimens, previous experience with the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the vast experience with other common RNA respiratory viruses are all addressed. Taken together, these data provide little evidence to suggest the presence of intact transmissible SARS-CoV in organs that can potentially be transplanted, specifically liver and heart.

A total of 921 of 7034 proteins were identified as significantly altered by aMPV/C infection. Three selected proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Bioinformatics GO analysis revealed multiple signaling pathways involving cell cycle, endocytosis, and PI3K-Akt, mTOR, MAPK and p53 signaling pathways, which might participate in viral infection. In this analysis, we found that PLK2 expression was upregulated by aMPV/C infection and investigated whether it contributed to aMPV/C-mediated cellular dysfunction. Suppressing PLK2 attenuated aMPV/C-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and p53-dependent apoptosis and reduced virus release.

With regard to the management of pregnant COVID-19 patients, in addition to the treatment of the infection itself, which is not that different from generally accepted principles, it is interesting to consider which obstetric procedures should be used to minimize the adverse effects on mother and child. Questions arise concerning the continuation of pregnancy, how to terminate the pregnancy, the possibility of virus transmission through the placenta, isolation of the newborn after birth, and breastfeeding. The aim of this study was to review the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in pregnant women. Because the epidemic began in China, most of the available literature comes from studies conducted there. The studies used to prepare this review article are the first non-randomized studies containing small groups of examined women. They do not provide clear indications, but show that in an epidemic situation, special care should be taken in pregnancy management, making decisions about termination of pregnancy, and handling of the newborn baby to minimize the risk of subsequent health consequences. Further analysis is needed on the incidence of COVID-19 among pregnant women and its consequences. This will allow us to develop recommendations on how to deal with patients in the future in case of repeated epidemic emergencies.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gujski, Mariusz; Humeniuk, Ewa; Bojar, Iwona","journal":"Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.924725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385225/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["pregnant women","management of pregnant COVID","pregnancy management","infection","termination of pregnancy","continuation of pregnancy","epidemic situation","patients","incidence of COVID","epidemic of infectious diseases","small groups of examined women","case of repeated epidemic emergencies","non-randomized studies","altered physiology","altered susceptibility","newborn baby","review article","risk of subsequent health consequences","immune functions","sensitive group","isolation","placenta","SARS-CoV","future","possibility of virus transmission","current state of knowledge","special care","handling","addition","decisions","accepted principles","adverse effects","mother","child","study","birth","available literature","China","treatment","regard","obstetric procedures","breastfeeding","Questions","clear indications","aim","analysis","recommendations"],"language":"en"},

There are significant differences in therapeutic strategies of the different NEN subtypes, and therefore, precise classification of pulmonary NENs is critical. However, challenges in pulmonary NEN classification include overlap of diagnostic histological features among the subtypes and reduced or negative expression of neuroendocrine markers in poorly differentiated pulmonary NECs. Recently, transcription factor insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) was identified as a sensitive marker of neuroendocrine and neuroepithelial differentiation. In this study, INSM1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in greater than 94% of pulmonary NENs, indicating that it is a highly sensitive marker of pulmonary NENs and is useful to detect poorly differentiated pulmonary NECs. Although there are well-established morphological and immunohistologic criteria to diagnose pulmonary NENs, there is no universal consensus regarding prognostic markers of pulmonary NENs. Studies have shown that non-small cell lung cancers express long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which regulate gene expression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and carcinogenesis. We characterized expression and function of lncRNAs, including HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), maternally expressed 3 (MEG3), and prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) in pulmonary NENs, including typical carcinoid tumors, atypical carcinoid tumors, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC/NEC), and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC/NEC). In situ hybridization and real-time polymerase chain reaction studies showed higher expression (p \u003C 0.01) of all lncRNAs in SCLC/NEC. Small interfering RNA studies indicated a role for MEG3 and PCA3 in tumor proliferation. Therefore, these lncRNAs may serve as prognostic indicators of pulmonary NEN aggressiveness and as possible therapeutic targets.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Narayanan, Damodaran; Mandal, Rakesh; Hardin, Heather; Chanana, Vishal; Schwalbe, Michael; Rosenbaum, Jason; Buehler, Darya; Lloyd, Ricardo V","journal":"Endocrine pathology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12022-020-09626-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388776/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HOX","NEC","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms","prognostic markers of pulmonary NENs","sensitive marker of pulmonary NENs","pulmonary NEN classification","differentiated pulmonary NECs","precise classification of pulmonary NENs","prognostic indicators of pulmonary NEN aggressiveness","negative expression of neuroendocrine markers","INSM1 expression","low-grade neuroendocrine tumors","sensitive marker of neuroendocrine","large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma","higher expression","gene expression","high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas","small cell lung carcinoma","function of lncRNAs","Small interfering RNA studies","non-small cell lung cancers","atypical carcinoid tumors","different NEN subtypes","MEG3","PCA3","SCLC","therapeutic strategies","real-time polymerase chain reaction studies","non-coding RNAs","possible therapeutic targets","HOX transcript antisense RNA","role","overlap of diagnostic histological features","universal consensus","situ hybridization","immunohistologic criteria","LCNEC","transcription factor insulinoma-associated protein","prostate cancer antigen","HOTAIR","neuroepithelial differentiation","challenges","mesenchymal transition","significant differences","tumor proliferation","immunohistochemistry","carcinogenesis","study"],"language":"en"},
{"cord_uid":"alxvx8ms","sha":null,"source_x":"Medline","title":"The Feasibility and Effectiveness of Web-Based Advance Care Planning Programs: Scoping Review.","doi":"10.2196/15578","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32181750","license":"unk","abstract":"BACKGROUND Advance care planning (ACP) is a process with the overall aim to enhance care in concordance with patients\u0027 preferences. Key elements of ACP are to enable persons to define goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care, to discuss these with family and health care professionals, and to document and review these if appropriate. ACP is usually conducted through personal conversations between a health care professional, a patient, and-if appropriate-family members. Although Web-based ACP programs have the potential to support patients in ACP, their effectiveness is unknown. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of Web-based, interactive, and person-centered ACP programs. METHODS We systematically searched for quantitative and qualitative studies evaluating Web-based, interactive, and person-centered ACP programs in seven databases including EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central and Google Scholar. Data on the characteristics of the ACP programs\u0027 content (using a predefined list of 10 key elements of ACP), feasibility, and effectiveness were extracted using a predesigned form. RESULTS Of 3434 titles and abstracts, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria, evaluating 11 Web-based ACP programs-10 were developed in the United States and one in Ireland. Studied populations ranged from healthy adults to patients with serious conditions. Programs typically contained the exploration of goals and values (8 programs), exploration of preferences for treatment and care (11 programs), guidance for communication about these preferences with health care professionals or relatives (10 programs), and the possibility to generate a document in which preferences can be recorded (8 programs). Reportedly, participants were satisfied with the ACP programs (11/11 studies), considering them as easy to use (8/8 studies) and not burdensome (7/8 studies). Designs of 13 studies allowed evaluating the effectiveness of five programs. They showed that ACP programs significantly increased ACP knowledge (8/8 studies), improved communication between patients and their relatives or health care professionals (6/6 studies), increased ACP documentation (6/6 studies), and improved concordance between care as preferred by the patients and the decisions of clinicians and health care representatives (2/3 studies). CONCLUSIONS Web-based, interactive, and person-centered ACP programs were mainly developed and evaluated in the United States. They contained the key elements of ACP, such as discussing and documenting goals and preferences for future care. As participants considered programs as easy to use and not burdensome, they appeared to be feasible.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pars plana vitrectomy combined with scleral buckle versus pars plana vitrectomy alone for eyes with giant retinal tear. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 8), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in our electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 16 August 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pars plana vitrectomy combined with scleral buckle versus pars plana vitrectomy alone for giant retinal tear regardless of age, gender, lens status (e.g. phakic or pseudophakic eyes) of the affected eye(s), or etiology of GRT among participants enrolled in these trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts, then full-text articles, using Covidence. Any differences in classification between the two review authors were resolved through discussion. Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included trials. MAIN RESULTS We found two RCTs in abstract format (105 participants randomized). Neither RCT was published in full. Based on the data presented in the abstracts, scleral buckling might be beneficial (relative risk of re-attachement ranged from 3.0 to 4.4), but the findings are inconclusive due to a lack of peer reviewed publication and insufficient information for assessing risk of bias. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS We found no conclusive evidence from RCTs on which to base clinical recommendations for scleral buckle combined with pars plana vitrectomy for giant retinal tear. RCTs are clearly needed to address this evidence gap. Such trials should be randomized, and patients should be classified by giant retinal tear characteristics (extension (90\u00BA, 90\u00BA to 180\u00BA, \u003E 180\u00BA), location (oral, anterior, posterior to equator)), proliferative vitreoretinopathy stage, and endotamponade. Analysis should include both short-term (three months and six months) and long-term (one year to two years) outcomes for primary retinal reattachment, mean change in best corrected visual acuity, study eyes that required second surgery for retinal reattachment, and adverse events such as elevation of intraocular pressure above 21 mmHg, choroidal detachment, cystoid macular edema, macular pucker, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and progression of cataract in initially phakic eyes.","publish_time":"2019-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gutierrez, Mario; Rodriguez, Jose L; Zamora-de La Cruz, Diego; Flores Pimentel, Mariana Aracely; Jimenez-Corona, Aida; Novak, Linda C; Cano Hidalgo, Rene; Graue, Federico","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012646.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31840810/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Embase.com","ClinicalTrials.gov","World Health Organization","International Clinical Trials Registry Platform","GRT","RCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["giant retinal tear characteristics","included trials","safety of pars plana vitrectomy","randomized controlled trials","RCTs","primary retinal reattachment","scleral buckle","Cochrane Eyes","Vision Trials Register","neurosensory retinal break","study eyes","pseudophakic eyes","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","review authors","scleral buckling","risk of bias","International Clinical Trials Registry Platform","abstracts","abstracted data","DATA COLLECTION","months","ANALYSIS","participants","electronic search","proliferative vitreoretinopathy stage","posterior vitreous detachment","macular pucker","choroidal detachment","clinical recommendations","Health Sciences","relative risk of re-attachement","etiology of GRT","SEARCH METHODS","conclusive evidence","electronic databases","evidence gap","cystoid macular edema","World Health Organization","mean change","best corrected visual acuity","Caribbean Literature","mmHg","insufficient information","PubMed","equator","years","adverse events","outcomes","Ovid MEDLINE","gender","lack of peer reviewed publication","elevation of intraocular pressure","extension","lens status","progression of cataract","ICTRP","surgery","effectiveness","affected eye","LILACS","language restrictions","location","titles","BACKGROUND","abstract format","SELECTION CRITERIA","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","text articles","date","presence","endotamponade","classification","patients","MAIN RESULTS","Covidence","findings","OBJECTIVES","differences","discussion","Issue"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, AKT regulates the hallmarks of cancer, e.g. tumor growth, survival and invasiveness of tumor cells. After AKT was discovered in the early 1990s, further studies revealed that there are three different AKT isoforms, namely AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3. Despite their high similarity of 80%, the distinct AKT isoforms exert non-redundant, partly even opposing effects under physiological and pathological conditions. Breast cancer as the most common cancer entity in women, frequently shows alterations of the PI3K/AKT signaling. MAIN CONTENT A plethora of studies addressed the impact of AKT isoforms on tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis of breast cancer as well as on therapy response and overall survival in patients. Therefore, this review aimed to give a comprehensive overview about the isoform-specific effects of AKT in breast cancer and to summarize known downstream and upstream mechanisms. Taking account of conflicting findings among the studies, the majority of the studies reported a tumor initiating role of AKT1, whereas AKT2 is mainly responsible for tumor progression and metastasis. In detail, AKT1 increases cell proliferation through cell cycle proteins like p21, p27 and cyclin D1 and impairs apoptosis e.g. via p53. On the downside AKT1 decreases migration of breast cancer cells, for instance by regulating TSC2, palladin and EMT-proteins. However, AKT2 promotes migration and invasion most notably through regulation of \u03B2-integrins, EMT-proteins and F-actin. Whilst AKT3 is associated with a negative ER-status, findings about the role of AKT3 in regulation of the key properties of breast cancer are sparse. Accordingly, AKT1 is mutated and AKT2 is amplified in some cases of breast cancer and AKT isoforms are associated with overall survival and therapy response in an isoform-specific manner. CONCLUSIONS Although there are several discussed hypotheses how isoform specificity is achieved, the mechanisms behind the isoform-specific effects remain mostly unrevealed. As a consequence, further effort is necessary to achieve deeper insights into an isoform-specific AKT signaling in breast cancer and the mechanism behind it.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hinz, Nico; J\u00FCcker, Manfred","journal":"Cell communication and signaling : CCS","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-019-0450-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752925/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI3K/AKT","AKT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isoform-specific AKT","BACKGROUND AKT","isoform-specific effects of AKT","angiogenesis of breast cancer","cases of breast cancer","impact of AKT isoforms","distinct AKT isoforms","different AKT isoforms","hallmarks of cancer","migration of breast cancer cells","key properties of breast cancer","AKT2","common cancer entity","tumor growth","isoform-specific manner","tumor initiating role of AKT1","tumor progression","isoform specificity","downside AKT1","invasiveness of tumor cells","EMT-proteins","overall survival","plethora of studies","role of AKT3","cell cycle proteins","therapy response","metastasis","PI3K","cell proliferation","key element","regulation of \u03B2","upstream mechanisms","account of conflicting findings","p27","p21","deeper insights","cyclin D1","integrins","TSC2","instance","protein kinase B","comprehensive overview","effort","apoptosis","discussed hypotheses","negative ER-status","palladin","women","alterations","invasion","patients","majority","F-actin","pathological conditions","MAIN CONTENT","consequence","p53","CONCLUSIONS","review","pathway","high similarity"],"language":"en"},

In addition, due to the often high-calorie meals eaten to break the fast, Ramadan should be seen as a cycle of fasting and feasting. Ramadan fasting can impact those with diabetes, increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and dehydration. This year, Ramadan will occur during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Reports show that diabetes appears to be a risk factor for more severe disease with COVID-19. In addition, the UK experience has shown diabetes and COVID-19 is associated with dehydration, starvation ketosis, diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state.

Various scaffold material, design, including their combination with several growth- induced substances and cells application have been being investigated and used in the area of nerve tissue engineering. However, the development remains challenges today because they are still far from ideal concerning their stability, reproducibility, including complicated handling related to the poor mechanical strength. In view of the current basis, in this study the introduction of carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA) as promising candidate to increase mechanical properties of nerve scaffold is reported. The incorporation of CHA was not only expected to provide better mechanical properties of the scaffold. Under physiological condition, CHA is known to be the most stable phases of calcium phosphate compound. Therefore, CHA was expected to provide controlled release calcium for better axonal environment and promote fasten nerve regeneration. This study shows that CHA incorporated gelatin membrane has ideal microstructure to prevent fibrous tissue ingrowth into the injury site, while retaining its capability to survive nerve tissue by allowing adequate glucose and specific proteins diffusion. The provided Ca2\u002B release to the environment promoted neuronal growth, without suppressing acetylcholine esterase release activity.

Spreading globally, it is now considered pandemic, with approximately 3 million cases worldwide at the end of April. Its symptoms include fever, cough, and headache, but the main one is shortness of breath. In turn, it is believed that there is a relationship between COVID-19 and damage to the heart muscle, and hypertensive and diabetic patients, for example, seem to have worse prognosis. Therefore, COVID-19 may worsen in individuals with underlying adverse conditions, and a not negligible number of patients hospitalized with this virus had cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. Systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression may be behind this association. In addition, the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors, more precisely ACE2, to penetrate the cell; therefore, the use of ACE inhibitor drugs and angiotensin receptor blockers could cause an increase in these receptors, thus facilitating the entry of the virus into the cell. There is, however, no scientific evidence to support the interruption of these drugs. Since they are fundamental for certain chronic diseases, the risk and benefit of their withdrawal in this scenario should be carefully weighed.

The functional importance of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) in viral replication and maturation turns it into an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronaviruses. At present, there is no standard drug regime nor any vaccine available against the infection. The rapid development and identification of efficient interventions against SARS-CoV-2 remains a major challenge. Based on the available knowledge of closely related coronavirus and their safety profiles, repurposing of existing antiviral drugs and screening of available databases is considered a near term strategic and economic way to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Herein, we applied computational drug design methods to identify Chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors from FDA approved antiviral drugs and our in-house database of natural and drug-like compounds of synthetic origin. As a result three FDA approved drugs ( Remdesivir, Saquinavir and Darunavir) and two natural compounds (. flavone and coumarine derivatives) were identified as promising hits. Further, MD simulation and binding free energy calculations were performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior, stability of protein-ligand contact, and binding affinity of the hit compounds. Our results indicate that the identified compounds can inhibit the function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of Coronavirus. Considering the severity of the spread of coronavirus, the current study is in-line with the concept of finding the new inhibitors against the vital pathway of the corona virus to expedite the process of drug discovery.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Salman Ali; Zia, Komal; Ashraf, Sajda; Uddin, Reaz; Ul-Haq, Zaheer","journal":"Journal of biomolecular structure \u0026 dynamics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1751298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32238094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","FDA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","natural compounds","identified compounds","existing antiviral drugs","FDA approved drugs","development of effective antiviral drugs","protease inhibitors","related coronavirus","novel Coronavirus","spread of coronavirus","hit compounds","vaccine available","function of Chymotrypsin","standard drug regime","available knowledge","process of drug discovery","CLpro","compounds of synthetic origin","world","computational drug design methods","screening of available databases","functional importance of Chymotrypsin","binding affinity","rapid development","economic way","new inhibitors","corona virus","in-house database of natural","binding free energy calculations","Remdesivir","Saquinavir","near term strategic","identification of efficient interventions","stability of protein","ligand contact","safety profiles","maturation","MD simulation","vital pathway","Darunavir","attractive target","dynamic behavior","current study","outbreak","coumarine derivatives","public emergency of international concern","viral replication","line","concept","coronaviruses","promising hits","flavone","Wuhan","China","major challenge","infection","severity","present","results","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

A second scenario predicts the opposite outcome, a lowered level of consumption, based on the decreased physical and financial availability of alcohol. With the current restrictions on alcohol availability, it is postulated that, for the immediate future, the predominant scenario will likely be the second, while the distress experienced in the first may become more relevant in the medium- and longer-term future.

The epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure at Wuhan\u0027s Huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic. The basic productive number (R0) at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2, with an average incubation period of 5.2 days. The proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4%, the mortality rate was lower than those of SARS and MERS, and 96.5% of deaths occurred in Hubei Province, where the outbreak occurred first. Among them, elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate. Chinese medical staff have summarized a set of effective strategies and methods in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease that are worthy of reference for their international counterparts. With powerful government intervention and the efforts of Chinese medical staff, China\u0027s outbreak has gradually improved. This article is protected by copyright.

Several cutis laxa syndromes are inborn errors of metabolism and lead to severe neurological symptoms. PATIENT AND METHODS In a patient with cutis laxa, a choreoathetoid movement disorder, dysmorphic features and intellectual disability we performed exome sequencing to elucidate the underlying genetic defect. We identified the amino acid substitution R275W in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type II\u03B1, caused by a homozygous missense mutation in the PI4K2A gene. We used lipidomics, complexome profiling and functional studies to measure phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis in the patient and evaluated PI4K2A deficient mice to define a novel metabolic disorder. RESULTS The R275W residue, located on the surface of the protein, is involved in forming electrostatic interactions with the membrane. The catalytic activity of PI4K2A in patient fibroblasts was severely reduced and lipid mass spectrometry showed that particular acyl-chain pools of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 were decreased. CONCLUSIONS Phosphoinositide lipids play a major role in intracellular signalling and trafficking and regulate the balance between proliferation and apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases such as PI4K2A mediate the first step in the main metabolic pathway that generates PI4P, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 . Although neurologic involvement is common, cutis laxa has not been reported previously in metabolic defects affecting signalling. Here we describe a patient with a complex neurological phenotype, premature aging and a mutation in PI4K2A, illustrating the importance of this enzyme in the generation of inositol lipids with particular acylation characteristics.

Here, dihydropyrrolidones (DHPs), the products of an efficient multi-components reaction, were found to possess good activities against influenza A virus (IAV). Primary structure-activity relationship indicated that the activities of DHPs were greatly influenced by substituents and four of them had IC50 values lower than 10 \u03BCM (DHPs 5-2, 8, 14 and 19: IC50 = 3.11-9.23 \u03BCM). The activities against multiple IAV strains and mechanism of DHPs were further investigated by using 5-2 (IC50 = 3.11 \u03BCM). It was found that 5-2 possessed antiviral effects against all the investigated subtypes of IAVs with the IC50 values from 3.11 to 7.13 \u03BCM. Moreover, 5-2 showed very low cytotoxicity with CC50 \u003E 400 \u03BCM. Results of mechanism study indicated that 5-2 could efficiently inhibit replication of IAV, up-regulate the expression of key antiviral cytokines IFN-\u03B2 and antiviral protein MxA, and suppress the production of the NDAPH oxidase NOX1 in MDCK cells. These results indicated that 5-2 could be used as a potential inhibitor against wide subtypes of IAVs.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Teng; Dai, Chenshu; Sang, Huiting; Chen, Fangzhao; Huang, Yingna; Liao, Hui; Liu, Shuwen; Zhu, Qiuhua; Yang, Jie","journal":"European journal of medicinal chemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408213/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV","MDCK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03BCM","activities of DHPs","mechanism of DHPs","IC50 values lower","antiviral effects","influenza viruses","investigated subtypes of IAVs","good activities","replication of IAV","antiviral protein MxA","wide subtypes of IAVs","multiple IAV strains","Results of mechanism study","conventional anti-influenza drugs","expression of key antiviral cytokines IFN-\u03B2","products","NDAPH oxidase NOX1","production","therapeutic strategies","drug resistance","efficient multi-components reaction","MDCK cells","potential inhibitor","Primary structure-activity relationship","low cytotoxicity","CC50","dihydropyrrolidones","substituents"],"language":"en"},

Yet, the failure rates after reconstruction are much higher than the adult population. The purpose of this paper is to understand failure rates, reasons for graft failure, and strategies for successful revision surgery. RECENT FINDINGS A complete understanding of the failure etiology is essential for the clinician treating this population prior to revision. This begins with an assessment of post-operative patient compliance and sporting activity. Surgical technique must then be scrutinized for non-anatomic tunnel placement and poor graft size/type. Concurrent bony deformity must also be addressed including lower extremity valgus alignment and tibial slope abnormalities. Meniscus and chondral injury must be aggressively treated. Furthermore, imaging must be examined to look for missed posterolateral corner injury. Lateral extra-articular tenodesis (in the setting of ligamentous laxity or rotational instability) may be also indicated as well. The surgeon can then choose a graft type and surgical technique that optimizes outcome and respects skeletal growth. Prior to surgical intervention, the clinician must also counsel patients in regard to the guarded prognosis and outcomes in this setting. Prolonged rehabilitation protocols/return-to-play timing as well as sporting activity modification in the post-operative period after revision are critical. There is limited literature on revision ACL reconstruction in the skeletally immature athlete. An understanding of all the risk factors for failure is essential in order to achieve treatment success.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia, Steven; Pandya, Nirav K","journal":"Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12178-020-09627-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388725/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["graft failure","failure rates","failure etiology","revision ACL reconstruction","graft type","Surgical technique","sporting activity modification","high-demand sporting activity","clinician","successful revision surgery","surgical intervention","post-operative period","poor graft size","complete understanding","adult population","chondral injury","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","assessment of post-operative patient compliance","setting of ligamentous laxity","posterolateral corner injury","rate of pediatric","adolescent anterior cruciate ligament","non-anatomic tunnel placement","lower extremity valgus alignment","increase","strategies","tibial slope abnormalities","guarded prognosis","regard","order","reasons","risk factors","return","Lateral extra-articular tenodesis","rotational instability","outcomes","patients","respects skeletal growth","timing","limited literature","RECENT FINDINGS","immature athlete","Prolonged rehabilitation protocols","treatment success","paper","Concurrent bony deformity","Meniscus","surgeon","imaging"],"language":"en"}]}

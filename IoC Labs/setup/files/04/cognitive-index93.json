It is mainly expressed in cardiac blood vessels and the tubular epithelia of kidneys and abnormal expression has been implicated in diabetes, hypertension and heart failure. The mechanism and physiological function of this zinc metallopeptidase in mammals are not yet fully understood. Non-mammalian vertebrate models offer attractive and simple alternatives that could facilitate the exploration of ACE2 function. In this paper we report the in silico analysis of Ace2 genes from the Gallus (chicken), Xenopus (frog), Fugu and Tetraodon (pufferfish) genome assembly databases, and from the Danio (zebrafish) cDNA library. Exon ambiguities of Danio and Xenopus Ace2s were resolved by RT-PCR and 3\u2032RACE. Analyses of the exon\u2013intron structures, alignment, phylogeny and hydrophilicity plots, together with the conserved synteny among these vertebrates, support the orthologous relationship between mammalian and non-mammalian ACE2s. The putative promoters of Ace2 from human, Tetraodon and Xenopus tropicalis drove the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) specifically in the heart tissue of transgenic Xenopus thus making it a suitable model for future functional genomic studies. Additionally, the search for conserved cis-elements resulted in the discovery of WGATAR motifs in all the putative Ace2 promoters from 7 different animals, suggesting a possible role of GATA family transcriptional factors in regulating the expression of Ace2.","publish_time":"2006-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chou, Chih-Fong; Loh, Chay Boon; Foo, Yik Khoon; Shen, Shuo; Fielding, Burtram C.; Tan, Timothy H.P.; Khan, Sehaam; Wang, Yue; Lim, Seng Gee; Hong, Wanjin; Tan, Yee-Joo; Fu, Jianlin","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4518e94c8d782b510f4cd492c26736cd41bb1d75.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125734.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111906002046; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111906002046","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GATA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of Ace2","putative promoters of Ace2","putative Ace2 promoters","Xenopus Ace2s","exploration of ACE2 function","Xenopus tropicalis","non-mammalian ACE2s","silico analysis of Ace2 genes","Tetraodon","abnormal expression","heart tissue of transgenic Xenopus","Non-mammalian vertebrate models","Exon ambiguities of Danio","angiotensin system","physiological function","Abstract Angiotensin","conserved synteny","heart failure","expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein","conserved cis-elements","suitable model","possible role of GATA family transcriptional factors","tubular epithelia of kidneys","acts","alignment","EGFP","different animals","human","simple alternatives","intron structures","orthologous relationship","phylogeny","future functional genomic studies","hydrophilicity plots","RAS","renin","pufferfish","genome assembly databases","diabetes","Fugu","chicken","Gallus","discovery of WGATAR motifs","zinc metallopeptidase","identified member","cardiac blood vessels","vertebrates","frog","RT-PCR","negative regulator of ACE","zebrafish","cDNA library","hypertension","search","mechanism","mammals"],"language":"en"},

Currently, few studies have validated the causal pathways of determinants of health literacy through the use of statistical modeling. The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate a health literacy model at an individual level that could best explain the determinants of health literacy and the associations between health literacy and health behaviors even health status. METHODS: Skill-based health literacy test and a self-administrated questionnaire survey were conducted among 3222 Chinese adult residents. Path analysis was applied to validate the model. RESULTS: The model explained 38.6% of variance for health literacy, 11.7% for health behavior and 2.3% for health status: (GFI = 0.9990; RMR = 0.0521; \u03C7(2) = 10.2151, P = 0.1159). Education has positive and direct effect on prior knowledge (\u03B2 = 0.324) and health literacy (\u03B2 = 0.346). Health literacy is also affected by prior knowledge (\u03B2 = 0.245) and age (\u03B2 = -0.361). Health literacy is a direct influencing factor of health behavior (\u03B2 = 0.101). The most important factor of health status is age (\u03B2 = 0.107). Health behavior and health status have a positive interaction effect. CONCLUSION: This model explains the determinants of health literacy and the associations between health literacy and health behaviors well. It could be applied to develop intervention strategies to increase individual health literacy, and then to promote health behavior and health status.","publish_time":"2013-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Xinying; Shi, Yuhui; Zeng, Qingqi; Wang, Yanling; Du, Weijing; Wei, Nanfang; Xie, Ruiqian; Chang, Chun","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94ccd6a7571a178e789bb682a3d630bc9eb319ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3621712.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23521806/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-13-261","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health literacy model","determinants of health literacy","health behaviors","individual health literacy","basic health information","appropriate health decisions","important factor of health status","Skill-based health literacy test","direct influencing factor of health behavior","associations","direct effect","prior knowledge","age","positive interaction effect","causal pathways of determinants","individual level","self-administrated questionnaire survey","services","use of statistical modeling","METHODS","intervention strategies","capacity","Chinese adult residents","degree","Education","process","GFI","variance","purpose","present study","RMR","individuals","studies","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","Path analysis","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To these ends, we investigated the antigenicity of the spike protein (S protein), a major structural protein in the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Based upon the theoretical analysis for hydrophobicity of the S protein, 18 peptides were synthesized. Using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), these peptides were screened in the sera from SARS patients. According to these results, two fragments of the S gene were amplified by PCR and cloned into pET-32a. Both S fragments were expressed in the BL-21 strain and further purified with an affinity chromatography. These recombinant S fragments were confirmed to have positive cross-reactions with SARS sera, either by Western blot or by ELISA. Our results demonstrated that the potential epitope regions were located at Codons 469\u2013882 in the S protein, and one epitope site was located at Codons 599\u2013620.

Methods Students who previously registered for the Medical Student Neurosurgery Training Camps were sent an online Qualtrics survey, requesting them to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic was affecting their neurosurgical education. The Pearson Chi-Square test and post-hoc pairwise Fisher\u2019s exact test were used for analysis of categorical variables and the two-tailed paired Student\u2019s t-test was utilized for continuous variables. Results The survey was distributed to 852 medical students with 127 complete responses. Concerns regarding conferences/networking opportunities (63%), clinical experience (59%), and board exam scores (42%) were most frequently cited. 76% of M3s reported at least one cancelled/postponed neurosurgery rotation.

As with the more extensively studied murine and human DCs, porcine DC can be generated from bone marrow haematopoietic cells or monocytes, and have been analysed in various immunological and non-immunological tissues. Both conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) have been characterized. The function of porcine monocyte-derived DC has not only been characterized in terms of antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation, but also their response to various ligands of pattern recognition receptors. These have been characterized in terms of the induction of DC maturation and pro-inflammatory, Th1-like or Th2-like cytokines secretion. Porcine pDC most effectively sense virus infections and are characterized by their capacity to produce large quantities of IFN-\u03B1 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03B1, IL-6 and IL-12. As such, the DC family as a whole is a powerful ally in the host battle against pathogen attack. Nevertheless, DC in particular tissue environments or under particular stimuli can down-regulate immune response development. This is not only important for preventing over-activation of the immune system and also for ensuring tolerance against self or \u201Cfriendly\u201D substances including food components, but may also be used as a mechanism of pathogens to evade immune responses.","publish_time":"2008-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Summerfield, Artur; McCullough, Kenneth C.","journal":"Dev Comp Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d640997399cfd57831f415625bc8f66170bca496.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103208.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X08001031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18582937/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X08001031; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2008.05.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine DC","plasmacytoid DC","conventional DC","DC family","induction of DC maturation","field of porcine immunology DC biology","function of porcine monocyte-derived DC","Porcine pDC","immune system","adaptive immune responses","immune response development","pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03B1","particular stimuli","lymphocyte activation","dendritic cells","over-activation","human DCs","cytokines secretion","particular tissue environments","non-immunological tissues","terms of antigen presentation","bone marrow haematopoietic cells","various ligands of pattern recognition receptors","advances","host battle","Th1","cDC","large quantities of IFN","substances","powerful ally","capacity","monocytes","tolerance","Th2","pathogen attack","pivotal roles","virus infections","food components","self","mechanism of pathogens"],"language":"en"},

There is limited understanding of how the time in the future over which individuals make a behavioral decision, their planning horizon, affects epidemic dynamics. We developed an agent-based model (along with an ODE analog) to explore the decision-making of self-interested individuals on adopting prophylactic behavior. The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence with individuals\u0027 payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of prophylactic behavior reduces the peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially generates secondary waves of infection. These effects can be made stronger by increasing the behavioral decision frequency or distorting an individual\u2019s perceived risk of infection.","publish_time":"2016-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nardin, Luis G.; Miller, Craig R.; Ridenhour, Benjamin J.; Krone, Stephen M.; Joyce, Paul; Baumgaertner, Bert O.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffbf8ea9948d73572fd052a74afa01b19e6758a3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b9b42da668358e58cf7265b716e3ef1621ea7887.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/069013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Adoption of prophylactic behavior","disease prevalence","Human behavior","long planning horizons individuals","disease parameters","intermediate planning horizons","decision-making of self-interested individuals","spread of infectious disease","perceived protection efficacy","behavioral decision frequency","prophylaxis efficacy","decision-making process","individual\u2019s perceived risk of infection","epidemic dynamics","secondary waves of infection","individuals\u0027 payoffs","peak size","time","ODE analog","agent-based model","future","contrast","limited understanding","results","effects"],"language":"en"},

In the past few decades, efforts to understand the microbiota of periodontal diseases have led to an exponential increase in information about biofilms associated with periodontal health and disease. In fact, the oral microbiota is one of the best characterized microbiomes that colonize the human body. Despite this increased knowledge, one has to ask if our fundamental concepts of the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontal diseases have really changed. In this chapter we will review how our comprehension of the structure and function of the subgingival microbiota evolved over the years in search of lessons learned and unlearned in periodontal microbiology. More specifically, this review focuses on: 1) how the data obtained through molecular techniques has impacted our knowledge of the etiology of periodontal infections; 2) the potential role of viruses in the etiopathogenesis of periodontal diseases; 3) how concepts of microbial ecology have expanded our understanding of host microbial interactions that might lead to periodontal diseases; 4) the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; and 5) the impact of these evolving concepts on treatment and preventive approaches to periodontal infections. We will conclude by reviewing how novel systems biology approaches promise to unravel new details of the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases and, hopefully, lead to a better understanding of periodontal disease mechanisms.","publish_time":"2013-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teles, Ricardo; Teles, Flavia; Frias-Lopez, Jorge; Paster, Bruce; Haffajee, Anne","journal":"Periodontology 2000","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/947f8dd8bdf394efb2f27d252a1eadd66472232d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b9899ab24e4fd06be58cc2859b4322a84592c719.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3912758.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/prd.12010; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3912758?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23574465/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microbiota of periodontal diseases","etiopathogenesis of periodontal diseases","periodontal health","periodontal microbiology","etiology of periodontal infections","better understanding of periodontal disease mechanisms","subgingival microbiota","evolving concepts","oral microbiota","role of inflammation","concepts of microbial ecology","fundamental concepts","lead","review","specific subgingival species","preventive approaches","polymicrobial biofilms","understanding of host microbial interactions","bacterial species","increased knowledge","potential role of viruses","novel systems biology approaches","treatment","new details","information","best characterized microbiomes","exponential increase","result","gingival margin","structure","function","years","impact","efforts","human body","search of lessons","comprehension","progress","molecular techniques","decades","data","past","fact","chapter"],"language":"en"},

This expression can be controlled at various levels. This includes epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation or histone modifications. At the posttranscriptional level, regulation can be via alternative splicing or controlling messenger RNA (mRNA) stability. RNA cleavage is one way to control mRNA stability. For example, microRNA (miRNA)-induced mRNA cleavage has long been recognised in plants. RNA cleavage also appears to be widespread in other kingdoms of life, and it is now clear that mRNA cleavage plays critical functions in animals. Although miRNA-induced mRNA cleavage can occur in animals, it is not a widespread mechanism. Instead, mRNA cleavage can be induced by a range of other mechanisms, including by endogenous short inhibitory RNAs (endo-siRNAs), as well as the Ribonuclease III (RNase III) enzymes Drosha and Dicer. In addition, RNA cleavage induced by endo-siRNAs and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) is important for genome defence against transposons. Moreover, several RNase has been identified as important antiviral mediators. In this review, we will discuss these various RNA endonucleolytic cleavage mechanisms utilised by animals to regulate the expression of genes and as a defence against retrotransposons and viral infection.","publish_time":"2018-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Karen; Mok, Lawrence; Chong, Mark M.W.","journal":"Heliyon","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61d5afca8ca695ca95ccc62923155b542c3171f1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/26800b3eaee2dc23b411ad506c255ab5133a8608.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6223193.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844018311289; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00908; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844018311289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30426105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["miRNA-induced mRNA cleavage","mRNA stability","various RNA endonucleolytic cleavage mechanisms","animals","messenger RNA","endo-siRNAs","RNase","expression of genes","epigenetic regulation","genome defence","various levels","widespread mechanism","important antiviral mediators","endogenous short inhibitory RNAs","DNA methylation","piRNAs","alternative splicing","critical functions","histone modifications","retrotransposons","PIWI","microRNA","way","enzymes Drosha","Dicer","viral infection","addition","kingdoms of life","posttranscriptional level","Ribonuclease","example","range","appropriate function","review","plants"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We collected paired NP and OP swabs separately from pediatric and adult patients with influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory illness at two respiratory surveillance sites in Kenya. The specimens were tested for eight respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Positivity for a specific virus was defined as detection of viral nucleic acid in either swab. RESULTS: Of 2,331 paired NP/OP specimens, 1,402 (60.1%) were positive for at least one virus, and 393 (16.9%) were positive for more than one virus. Overall, OP swabs were significantly more sensitive than NP swabs for adenovirus (72.4% vs. 57.6%, p\u003C0.01) and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (91.2% vs. 70.4%, p\u003C0.01). NP specimens were more sensitive for influenza B virus (83.3% vs. 61.5%, p = 0.02), parainfluenza virus 2 (85.7%, vs. 39.3%, p\u003C0.01), and parainfluenza virus 3 (83.9% vs. 67.4%, p\u003C0.01). The two methods did not differ significantly for human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H3N2) virus, parainfluenza virus 1, or respiratory syncytial virus. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivities were variable among the eight viruses tested; neither specimen was consistently more effective than the other. For respiratory disease surveillance programs using qRT-PCR that aim to maximize sensitivity for a large number of viruses, collecting combined NP and OP specimens would be the most effective approach.","publish_time":"2011-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Curi; Ahmed, Jamal A.; Eidex, Rachel B.; Nyoka, Raymond; Waiboci, Lilian W.; Erdman, Dean; Tepo, Adan; Mahamud, Abdirahman S.; Kabura, Wamburu; Nguhi, Margaret; Muthoka, Philip; Burton, Wagacha; Breiman, Robert F.; Njenga, M.

The development of new antiviral agents for SARS-CoV is an important issue. We tried to find potential resource from Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for development of new drugs against SARS-CoV. Materials and Methods Our team recruited the potential TCM formulae (also known as Kampo) from two TCM books, Shang-Han Lun (Discussion of Cold-Induced Disorders) and Wen-Bing Tiau-Bein (Differential Management of Febrile Diseases). Several herbs, which were believed to be beneficial for SARS by experienced TCM doctors were also recruited. In addition, a vegetable polular in Taiwan, China and Malaysia, the tender leaf of Toona sinensis Roem (also known as Cedrela sinensis, belongs to the family Meliacceae) was also recruited under the suggestion of botanic experts. These TCM products and plant extrats were then tested for the effectiveness against SARS-CoV in vitro. Results Only TSL-1, the extract from tender leaf of Toona sinensis Roem was found to have an evident effect against SARS-CoV with selectivity index 12\u223C17.

While similar effects were obtained on fibroblasts, concentrations of IFN-\u03B3 4\u20138-fold greater were required.

To prepare for a pandemic, hospitals need a strategy to manage their space, staff, and supplies so that optimum care is provided to patients. In addition, infection prevention measures need to be implemented to reduce in-hospital transmission. In the operating room, these preparations involve multiple stakeholders and can present a significant challenge. Here, we describe the outbreak response measures of the anesthetic department staffing the largest (1,700-bed) academic tertiary level acute care hospital in Singapore (Singapore General Hospital) and a smaller regional hospital (Sengkang General Hospital). These include engineering controls such as identification and preparation of an isolation operating room, administrative measures such as modification of workflow and processes, introduction of personal protective equipment for staff, and formulation of clinical guidelines for anesthetic management. Simulation was valuable in evaluating the feasibility of new operating room set-ups or workflow. We also discuss how the hierarchy of controls can be used as a framework to plan the necessary measures during each phase of a pandemic, and review the evidence for the measures taken. These containment measures are necessary to optimize the quality of care provided to COVID-19 patients and to reduce the risk of viral transmission to other patients or healthcare workers.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Jolin; Goh, Qing Yuan; Tan, Zihui; Lie, Sui An; Tay, Yoong Chuan; Ng, Shin Yi; Soh, Chai Rick","journal":"Can J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28af7e31fa879038cbabc73d898dd7a43e1c4d30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090449.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01620-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32162212/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Singapore (Singapore General Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["necessary measures","hospital transmission","administrative measures","containment measures","Singapore General Hospital","outbreak response measures","patients","Sengkang General Hospital","infection prevention measures","smaller regional hospital","academic tertiary level acute care hospital","staff","quality of care","optimum care","COVID","pandemic","feasibility of new operating room set-ups","modification of workflow","anesthetic department","anesthetic management","engineering controls","hierarchy of controls","risk of viral transmission","introduction of personal protective equipment","processes","bed","formulation of clinical guidelines","multiple stakeholders","isolation","public health emergency of international concern","identification","strategy","preparations","healthcare workers","addition","framework","phase","significant challenge","Simulation","coronavirus disease","hospitals","space","evidence"],"language":"en"},

We show that bacteria-infecting viruses are strongly adapted to their specific hosts, but that they differ from other unrelated bacterial hosts. Viruses that infect humans, but not those that infect other mammals or aves, show a strong resemblance to most mammalian and avian hosts, in terms of both amino acid and codon preferences. In groups of viruses that infect humans or other mammals, the highest observed level of adaptation of viral proteins to host codon usages is for those proteins that appear abundantly in the virion. In contrast, proteins that are known to participate in host-specific recognition do not necessarily adapt to their respective hosts.

The results of testing in the microbiology laboratory have significant effects on the cost of clinical care, especially costs related to antimicrobial agents and infection control practices. Consequently many of the successful utilization management interventions described in clinical microbiology have targeted not just the volume of tests performed in the laboratory, but also the downstream costs of care.

The top hit compounds were further subjected to molecular dynamic simulations, yielding a greater understanding of the dynamic behavior of nsP3 and its complexes with various ligands, concurrently confirming the outcomes of docking, and establishing in silico lead compounds which target the CHIKV nsP3 enzyme.

The limited data available indicates that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, g\u00E9ros \u201Cold man\u201D and epilav\u00EDs, \u201Charmful\u201D) infection because the infection rates, severity, and lethality are substantially higher in the population aged 60 and older. This is primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of function, fitness, and increased frailty associated with aging. Immunosenescence is a major factor affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of infectious diseases. While vaccination reduces infection rates, and therapeutic interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these interventions have limitations. Previous studies showed that postulated geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog everolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients. This article presents a review of the limited literature available on geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be investigated to decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections. This article also highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as surrogate markers of biological age. These could be used to assess the need for, and efficacy of, geroprotective and senoremediative interventions and provide better protection for elderly populations from gerolavic infections. This article does not represent medical advice and the medications described are not yet licensed or recommended as immune system boosters, as they have not undergone clinical evaluation for this purpose.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhavoronkov, Alex","journal":"Aging (Albany NY)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dafc17c07befd2b040bdf2e79a7bf5eb4b7f7841.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202545.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.102988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32229705/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["senoremediative interventions","decreased infection rates","severity","lethality of infections","article","therapeutic interventions","disease burden of gerolavic infections","elderly populations","aging research","geroprotective","burden of disease","immune function","COVID","need","immunosenescence","limited literature available","limited data available","lethality of infectious diseases","age-associated vulnerability","rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks","small sample of elderly patients","vaccination response","clinical evaluation","general loss of function","immune system boosters","surrogate markers of biological age","RAD001","better protection","close derivative rapalog everolimus","rapamycin","fitness","g\u00E9ros","epilav\u00EDs","postulated geroprotectors","old man","betacoronavirus responsible","sirolimus","Greek","major factor","increased frailty","pandemic","review","efficacy","medications","Previous studies","SARS-CoV","medical advice","purpose","spotlight","limitations","comorbidity"],"language":"en"},

As an increasing proportion of the at-risk population becomes infected, and patients with severe illness are hospitalized, it is essential for hospitalists to remain current on how to best care for people with suspected or confirmed disease. Establishing a system for logistical planning, and accurate information sharing is strongly recommended. Infection control remains the ultimate goal. As such, healthcare workers should be educated on universal and isolation precautions, and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment. Social distancing should be encouraged to prevent the spread of infection, and creative and innovative ways to reduce contact may need to be considered. Moreover, it is imperative to prepare for contingencies as medical staff will inevitably get sick or become unavailable.

However, little is known about the general beliefs of Ebola survivors regarding T\u0026CM and the impact of these beliefs in influencing their decisions around T\u0026CM use. This study examines Ebola survivors\u2019 attitudes towards T\u0026CM use in Sierra Leone. Materials and Methods: We conducted a nationwide quantitative cross-sectional study of 358 Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone between January and August 2018. We used descriptive analysis, chi-square tests and backward stepwise binary logistic regression for data analysis. Results: Close to half of the survivors (n = 163, 45.5%) had used T\u0026CM since their discharge from an Ebola treatment centre. Survivors who viewed T\u0026CM as boosting their immune system/resistance were 3.89 times (95%CI: 1.57\u20139.63, p = 0.003) more likely to use T\u0026CM than those who did not view T\u0026CM as boosting their immune system/resistance. Additionally, survivors who viewed T\u0026CM as having fewer side effects than conventional medicine were more likely to use T\u0026CM [OR = 5.03 (95%CI: 1.92\u201313.19, p = 0.001)]. Ebola survivors were more influenced to use T\u0026CM based on their personal experience of the effectiveness of T\u0026CM than by clinical evidence [OR = 13.72 (95%CI: 6.10\u201330.84, P \u003C 0.001)]. Ebola survivors who perceived T\u0026CM as providing them with more control than conventional medicine over their health/body were more likely to use T\u0026CM [OR = 4.15 (95%CI: 1.74\u20139.89, p = 0.001)] as opposed to those who did not perceive T\u0026CM in this way. Conclusions: Considering the widespread use of T\u0026CM, an understanding of Ebola survivors\u2019 attitudes/beliefs towards T\u0026CM is useful to healthcare providers and policymakers with regard to public education and practitioner\u2013survivors communication, T\u0026CM regulation and research in Sierra Leone. Ebola survivors appear to turn to T\u0026CM not only for treatment, but also to fill gaps in conventional health care services.","publish_time":"2019-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"James, Peter Bai; Wardle, Jon; Steel, Amie; Adams, Jon","journal":"Medicina (Kaunas)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bab6dd24b41528b0a321874ef4827c873846e335.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6681324.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina55070387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sierra Leone"],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of T","widespread use of T","general beliefs of Ebola survivors","survivors communication","conventional healthcare","Ebola treatment centre","understanding of Ebola survivors\u2019 attitudes","conventional medicine","Sierra Leone","healthcare providers","complementary healthcare","healthcare needs","conventional health care services","immune system","resistance","data analysis","descriptive analysis","nationwide quantitative cross-sectional study","stepwise binary logistic regression","chi-square tests","public education","policymakers","regard","practitioner","regulation","addition","gaps","body","half","objectives","effects","times","fewer","research","discharge","options","personal experience","Methods","control","decisions","Results","Background","Conclusions","clinical evidence","impact","Materials","way"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, to explore conserved features in spike protein dynamics and to identify potentially novel regions for drugging, we measured spike protein variability derived from 791 viral genomes and studied its properties by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The findings indicated that S2 subunit (heptad-repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), and connector domain (CD) domains) showed low variability, low fluctuations in MD, and displayed a trimer cavity. By contrast, the receptor binding domain (RBD) domain, which is typically targeted in drug discovery programs, exhibits more sequence variability and flexibility. Interpretations from MD simulations suggest that the monomer form of spike protein is in constant motion showing transitions between an \u0022up\u0022 and \u0022down\u0022 state. In addition, the trimer cavity may function as a \u0022bouncing spring\u0022 that may facilitate the homotrimer spike protein interactions with the ACE2 receptor. The feasibility of the trimer cavity as a potential drug target was examined by structure based virtual screening. Several hits were identified that have already been validated or suggested to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus in published cell models. In particular, the data suggest an action mechanism for molecules including Chitosan and macrolides such as the mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) pathway inhibitor Rapamycin. These findings identify a novel small molecule binding-site formed by the spike protein oligomer, that might assist in future drug discovery programs aimed at targeting the coronavirus (CoV) family of viruses.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalathiya, Umesh; Padariya, Monikaben; Mayordomo, Marcos; Lisowska, Ma\u0142gorzata; Nicholson, Judith; Singh, Ashita; Baginski, Maciej; Fahraeus, Robin; Carragher, Neil; Ball, Kathryn; Haas, Juergen; Daniels, Alison; Hupp, Ted R; Alfaro, Javier Antonio","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spike protein variability","spike protein dynamics","spike protein oligomer","monomer form of spike protein","homotrimer spike protein interactions","receptor binding domain","trimer cavity","low variability","ACE2 receptor","SARS-CoV","sequence variability","potential drug target","MD simulations","connector domain","future drug discovery programs","host cell receptor","findings","mammalian target of Rapamycin","novel small molecule binding-site","molecular dynamics","low fluctuations","novel regions","pathway inhibitor Rapamycin","published cell models","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","domains","important stage","action mechanism","molecules","Chitosan","macrolides","mTOR","structure","properties","CD","viral genomes","drugging","constant motion","HR1","data","heptad","enzyme","angiotensin","life cycle","conserved features","RBD","central helix","S2 subunit","transitions","family of viruses","contrast","virtual screening","Interpretations","flexibility","addition","feasibility","spring","state","hits"],"language":"en"},

We designed six small interfering (si)RNAs (N473, N580, N783, N796, N799 and N1227) that target the conserved region of the RABV challenge virus standard (CVS)-11 strain nucleoprotein (N) gene.

The Dectin-1 ligands zymosan, glucan phosphate and the anti-Dectin-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A11 had no effect on influenza virus induced IFN\u03B1/\u03B2 production by murine splenic pDC. However, mannan, a broad blocking reagent against mannose specific receptors, inhibited IFN\u03B1/\u03B2 production by pDC in response to inactivated influenza virus. Moreover, viral glycoproteins (influenza virus haemagglutinin and HIV-1 gp120) stimulated IFN\u03B1/\u03B2 production by splenocytes in a mannan-inhibitable manner, implicating the function of a lectin in glycoprotein induced IFN production. Lastly, the effect of CD200 on IFN induction was investigated. CD200 knock-out macrophages produced more IFN\u03B1 than wild-type macrophages in response to polyI:C, a MyD88-independent stimulus, consistent with CD200\u0027s known inhibitory effect on myeloid cells. In contrast, blocking CD200 with an anti-CD200 mAb resulted in reduced IFN\u03B1 production by pDC-containing splenocytes in response to CpG and influenza virus (MyD88-dependent stimuli). This suggests there could be a differential effect of CD200 on MyD88 dependent and independent IFN induction pathways in pDC and macrophages.

Given the high concentration of pro-inflammatory effectors at areas of viral infection, it is unclear how tissue pathology is limited while virus-infected cells are being eliminated. To better understand the spatial dynamics of the anti-inflammatory response to a cutaneous viral infection, we first screened cytokine mRNA expression levels after epicutaneous (ec.) VV infection and found a large increase the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Ex vivo analyses revealed that T cells in the skin were the primary IL-10-producing cells. To understand the distribution of IL-10-producing T cells in vivo, we performed multiphoton intravital microscopy (MPM) of VV-infected mice, assessing the location and dynamic behavior of IL-10 producing cells. Although virus-specific T cells were distributed throughout areas of the inflamed skin lacking overt virus-infection, IL-10(\u002B) cells closely associated with large keratinocytic foci of virus replication where they exhibited similar motility patterns to bulk antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells. Paradoxically, neutralizing secreted IL-10 in vivo with an anti-IL-10 antibody increased viral lesion size and viral replication. Additional analyses demonstrated that IL-10 antibody administration decreased recruitment of CCR2(\u002B) inflammatory monocytes, which were important for reducing viral burden in the infected skin. Based upon these findings, we conclude that spatially concentrated IL-10 production limits cutaneous viral replication and dissemination, likely through modulation of the innate immune repertoire at the site of viral growth.","publish_time":"2016-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cush, Stephanie S.; Reynoso, Glennys V.; Kamenyeva, Olena; Bennink, Jack R.; Yewdell, Jonathan W.; Hickman, Heather D.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfdf1cc025285b3c20fdde66f5de3be60b46930e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4798720.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26991092/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005493","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection","producing cells","virus-infected cells","cutaneous viral infection","areas of viral infection","Skin infection","concentrated IL","anti-IL","primary IL","distribution of IL","secreted IL","virus-specific T cells","VV infection","anti-inflammatory cytokine IL","viral burden","overt virus-infection","dynamic behavior of IL","infected skin","viral lesion size","site of viral growth","production limits cutaneous viral replication","inflamed skin","large keratinocytic foci of virus replication","VV-infected mice","inflammatory cellular response","anti-inflammatory response","inflammatory monocytes","large increase","antibody administration","Additional analyses","high concentration of pro-inflammatory effectors","bulk antigen-specific CD8","screened cytokine mRNA expression levels","dissemination","similar motility patterns","modulation","MPM","innate immune repertoire","recruitment of CCR2","location","multiphoton intravital microscopy","poxvirus vaccinia","tissue pathology","spatial dynamics","organized manner","findings"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Our results showed that MDA\u20105 expression was upregulated in lung tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COPD patients and there was a negative correlation between MDA\u20105 mRNA levels and forced expiratory volume in 1 s %pred. COPD patients had higher interleukin (IL)\u20101 and IL\u20108 mRNA expression levels, and these inflammatory cytokines positively correlate with MDA\u20105 levels. However, there was no difference in the expression of RIG\u2010I between COPD patients and control subjects. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that MDA\u20105, but not RIG\u2010I, may play a critical role in airway inflammation in COPD.","publish_time":"2014-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qiurui; Wan, Huanying; Huang, Shaoguang; Zhang, Yan; Wang, Yanchun; Guo, Xiaokui; He, Ping; Zhou, Min","journal":"Clin Respir J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57e61a5675bbe59c337b8e3c8a40b3c2b458f06f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162323.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992168/; https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.12177","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MDA","expression of RIG","COPD pathogenesis","role of RIG","acute exacerbation of COPD","mRNA expression levels","RESULTS","peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COPD patients","mRNA levels","IL","control subjects","Viral infection","viral elimination","critical role","important pattern recognition receptors","Retinoic acid inducible gene","Western blots","significant cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","lung tissues","real\u2010time PCR","immunohistochemistry","negative correlation","expiratory volume","higher interleukin","inflammatory cytokines","airway inflammation","melanoma differentiation","INTRODUCTION","study","RLRs","CONCLUSION","difference","OBJECTIVE","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Cathepsins have been identified as therapeutic targets in the search for new drugs against a number of human pathologies, including cancer, Alzheimer\u0027s, and osteoporosis. A number of natural products have been reported as selective inhibitors of some cathepsins. Chemical structure of natural products as inhibitors of cathepsins can be very diverse. Some peptidic natural products are inhibitors of the cysteine protease cathepsins such as E-64 isolated from Aspergillus, which is a cathepsin B inhibitor, or more recently the marine cyanobacterial metabolite gallinamide A which is a selective inhibitor of human cathepsin L. Also amino acid derivatives have been reported as inhibitors of cathepsin A. Other natural products include chalcone natural products possessing cytotoxic activities against prostate cancer cells and inhibiting cysteine cathepsins in vitro, antipain and its analogues isolated from Streptomyces as inhibitors of cathepsin K, and natural biflavones as novel inhibitors of cathepsins B and K. In this review we will report the most representative examples of natural products as inhibitors of cathepsins, especially the ones reported during the last decade.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vidal-Albalat, Andreu; Gonz\u00E1lez, Florenci V.","journal":"Studies in Natural Products Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3b939b80d247d79739cfff957e0418a1745fd2b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444637499000062; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444637499000062","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["A.

Serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) are APPs that are produced during inflammation, and likely play a role in host immunological defence against Eimeria infection and the associated intestinal tissue damage. We investigated the involvement of SAA and HP in an experimental study, including three groups of calves: a control group (group 0, n =11), and two groups infected with either 150,000 or 250,000 Eimeria zuernii oocysts (group 1 (n =11) and group 2 (n =12), respectively). The calves were monitored for 28 days and data was collected on oocyst excretion, faecal score, animal weight, and SAA and Hp serum concentrations. Generalized linear mixed models showed that the clinical symptoms, indicated by an increase in the number of oocysts in the faeces and severe diarrhoea, manifested at patency for group 1 and 2. Serum Hp and SAA levels also increased during this period. Hp appeared to be a more sensitive marker than SAA, and differences between groups 1 and 2 were observed only for Hp. Linear regression models showed a negative association between weight gain and Hp concentrations, calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) during the overall experimental period and the patency period. A similar result was seen for SAA only during the patency period. This result supports the assumption that reduced weight gain due to E. zuernii infection is an immunologically driven process that involves an increase in APPs. A random intercept regression model of oocyst shedding groups showed that calves shedding 1\u2013500 oocysts had reduced concentrations of Hp, indicating that a different immunological reaction occurs during mild shedding of E. zuernii oocysts than during more intensive shedding. A similar model was used to examine associations between faecal scores and Hp concentrations for each group. Group 2 calves with haemorrhagic diarrhoea displayed higher Hp levels than calves in that group with lower faecal scores, which may be in response to an increased demand for Hp in the repair process as a result of haemolysis. APPs seem to play an important role in determining the course of E. zuernii infection in calves, which may enhance our understanding of the immunological reaction and development of this disease.","publish_time":"2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lassen, Brian; Bangoura, Berit; Lepik, Triin; Orro, Toomas","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09e709e36923b9b784d84db97eac152bc53d10a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116924.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.06.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401715003192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26215927/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401715003192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAA","HP","Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hp concentrations","concentrations of Hp","Serum Hp","Hp serum concentrations","groups of calves","control group","higher Hp levels","SAA levels","APPs","zuernii infection","involvement of SAA","patency period","Eimeria zuernii oocysts","Eimeria infection","weight gain","number of oocysts","mild shedding of","intensive shedding","similar result","overall experimental period","animal weight","different immunological reaction","lower faecal scores","Linear regression models","Serum amyloid","similar model","result of haemolysis","host immunological defence","linear mixed models","random intercept regression model of oocyst","oocyst excretion","haemorrhagic diarrhoea","repair process","severe diarrhoea","driven process","experimental study","important role","increased demand","negative association","associations","general health stress","associated intestinal tissue damage","AUC","course of","clinical symptoms","diseases","cattle","Abstract Acute phase proteins","development","faeces","differences","area","response","understanding","haptoglobin","sensitive marker","curve","data","days","inflammation","assumption"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority. During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay. Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources. Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum. In order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed. In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly. The major aim is to protect patients as well as the medical staff from unnecessary infection, and to keep the healthcare system running effectively. Therefore, every effort should be taken to make the necessary investments.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimmermann, Matthias; Nkenke, Emeka","journal":"J Craniomaxillofac Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9507dd99d6754bf58e653bcc76a83b3c0f33ae19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128256.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcms.2020.03.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303420/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1010518220300834; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1010518220300834","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected patients","management of patients","testing of patients","COVID","maxillofacial surgery","order","inpatient units","elective surgery","infrastructure of outpatient units","SARS-CoV","unnecessary infection","pandemic","minimum","adequate personal protective equipment","high risk of SARS","operating rooms","risk of cross","unnecessary exposure","loss of resources","Emergency procedures","major aim","urgent procedures","redundancy","significant changes","treatment spectra","therapies","defined arrangements","demands","medical staff","aerosol formation","overlap","negative pressure","recovery","challenge","addition","aspects","need","early stage","interventions","Specialties","delay","review","peak","way","days","transmission","healthcare system","necessary investments","priority","effort"],"language":"en"},

However, genetic alterations occur every now and then during the course of genome duplication. In order to repair these genetic defects and lesions, nature has devised several repair pathways which function promptly to prevent the cell from accumulating permanent mutations. These repair mechanisms seem to be significantly impacted by posttranslational modifications of proteins like phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Protein ubiquitination is emerging as a critical regulatory mechanism of DNA damage response. Non-proteolytic, proteasome-independent functions of ubiquitin involving monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of DNA repair proteins contribute significantly to the signaling of DNA repair pathways. In this paper, we will particularly highlight the work on ubiquitin-mediated signaling in the repair processes involving the Fanconi anemia pathway, translesional synthesis, nucleotide excision repair, and repair of double-strand breaks. We will also discuss the role of ubiquitin ligases in regulating checkpoint mechanisms, the role of deubiquitinating enzymes, and the growing possibilities of therapeutic intervention in this ubiquitin-conjugation system.","publish_time":"2012-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghosh, Soma; Saha, Tapas","journal":"ISRN Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52bf83ff771d92f697a4ab0cfe70a99503940050.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4908256.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27398234/; https://doi.org/10.5402/2012/146748","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["repair mechanisms","repair of double","repair processes","DNA repair pathways","polyubiquitination of DNA repair proteins","nucleotide excision repair","role of ubiquitin ligases","ubiquitin-conjugation system","genetic defects","genetic alterations","proteasome-independent functions of ubiquitin","checkpoint mechanisms","Faithful transmission of genetic information","Protein ubiquitination","critical regulatory mechanism of DNA damage response","role of deubiquitinating enzymes","posttranslational modifications of proteins","generations","Fanconi anemia pathway","translesional synthesis","monoubiquitination","growing possibilities of therapeutic intervention","genomic stability","nature","phosphorylation","lesions","cell","accumulating permanent mutations","integrity","strand breaks","course of genome duplication","order","work","paper"],"language":"en"},

It is important to 1) identify the unique ethical challenges facing physicians who feel an obligation to care for victims of such disasters and 2) develop a national consensus on ethical guidelines as a resource for ethical decision making in medical disaster relief. Study Design A survey of pertinent literature was performed to assess experience and opinions on the condition of medical care in terrorist attacks and natural disasters, the ethical challenges of disaster medical care, and the professional responsibilities and responsiveness in disasters. Conclusions It is necessary to develop a national consensus on the ethical guidelines for physicians who care for patients, victims, and casualties of disasters, and to formulate a virtue-based, yet practical, ethical approach to medical care under such extreme conditions. An educational curriculum for medical students, residents, and practicing physicians is required to best prepare all physicians who might be called upon, in the future, to triage patients, allocate resources, and make difficult decisions about treatment priorities and comfort care. It is not appropriate to address these questions at the time of the disaster, but rather in advance, as part of the ethics education of the medical profession. Important issues for resolution include inpatient and casualty triage and prioritization, medical liability, altered standards of care, justice and equity, informed consent and patient autonomy, expanding scope of practice in disaster medicine, and the moral and ethical responsibilities of physicians to care for disaster victims.","publish_time":"2008-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holt, G.

We determined transcript-based MHC class I haplotypes for 385 Chinese rhesus macaques from five different experimental cohorts, providing a concise representation of the full complement of MHC class I major alleles expressed by each animal. In total, 123 Mamu-A and Mamu-B haplotypes were defined in the full Chinese rhesus macaque cohort. We then performed an analysis of haplotype frequencies across the experimental cohorts of Chinese rhesus macaques, as well as a comparison against a group of 96 Indian rhesus macaques. Notably, 35 of the 51 Mamu-A and Mamu-B haplotypes observed in Indian rhesus macaques were also detected in the Chinese population, with 85% of the 385 Chinese-origin rhesus macaques expressing at least one of these class I haplotypes. This unexpected conservation of Indian rhesus macaque MHC class I haplotypes in the Chinese rhesus macaque population suggests that immunologic insights originally gleaned from studies using Indian rhesus macaques may be more applicable to Chinese rhesus macaques than previously appreciated and may provide an opportunity for studies of CD8(\u002B) T-cell responses between populations. It may also be possible to extend these studies across multiple species of macaques, as we found evidence of shared ancestral haplotypes between Chinese rhesus and Mauritian cynomolgus macaques.","publish_time":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karl, Julie A.; Bohn, Patrick S.; Wiseman, Roger W.; Nimityongskul, Francesca A.; Lank, Simon M.; Starrett, Gabriel J.; O\u2019Connor, David H.","journal":"G3 (Bethesda)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae29a35ad6b9e4267e1d965b523a6b72cb2c088c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3704247.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23696100/; https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.113.006254","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Indian rhesus macaques","Chinese-origin rhesus macaques","experimental cohorts of Chinese rhesus macaques","Chinese rhesus macaque population","Chinese rhesus macaque cohort","Chinese population","use of Chinese","unexpected conservation of Indian rhesus macaque MHC class","Mauritian cynomolgus macaques","multiple species of macaques","Mamu-B haplotypes","complement of MHC class","transcript-based MHC class","evidence of shared ancestral haplotypes","studies of CD8","different experimental cohorts","relative lack of major histocompatibility complex","Macaca mulatta","infectious disease immunity research","immunologic insights","immunogenetics information available","concise representation","T-cell responses","analysis of haplotype frequencies","alleles","group","populations","comparison","opportunity","animal","total"],"language":"en"},

The role of SLC10A1 polymorphisms, particularly the Ser267Phe variant (rs2296651) in exon 4, has been frequently investigated in regard to risk of persistent HBV infection. However, these investigations have generated conflicting results. To examine whether common genetic variation at the SLC10A1 locus is associated with risk of persistent HBV infection, haplotype-tagging and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed in two case-control sample sets, totally including 2,550 cases (persistently HBV infected subjects, PIs) and 2,124 controls (spontaneously recovered subjects, SRs) of Southern Chinese ancestry. To test whether rare or subpolymorphic SLC10A1 variants are associated with disease risk, the gene\u2019s exons in 244 cases were sequenced. Overall, we found neither SNPs nor haplotypes of SLC10A1 showed significant association in the two sample sets. Furthermore, no significant associations of rare variants or copy number variation covering SLC10A1 were observed. Finally, expression quantitative trait locus analyses revealed that SNPs potentially affecting SLC10A1 expression also showed no significant associations. We conclude that genetic variation at the SLC10A1 locus is not likely a major risk factor of persistent HBV infection among Southern Chinese.","publish_time":"2017-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ying; Li, Yuanfeng; Wu, Miantao; Cao, Pengbo; Liu, Xiaomin; Ren, Qian; Zhai, Yun; Xie, Bobo; Hu, Yanling; Hu, Zhibin; Bei, Jinxin; Ping, Jie; Liu, Xinyi; Yu, Yinghua; Guo, Bingqian; Lu, Hui; Liu, Guanjun; Zhang, Haitao; Cui, Ying; Mo, Zengnan; Shen, Hongbing; Zeng, Yi-Xin; He, Fuchu; Zhang, Hongxing; Zhou, Gangqiao","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7267644046c69d176e889933002a9c8819751ff8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5399367.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28429786/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SLC10A1 locus","SLC10A1 expression","haplotypes of SLC10A1","risk of persistent HBV infection","subpolymorphic SLC10A1 variants","role of SLC10A1 polymorphisms","SNPs","major risk factor of persistent HBV infection","HBV infected subjects","disease risk","significant associations of rare variants","number variation","common genetic variation","cases","Southern Chinese ancestry","expression quantitative trait locus analyses","case-control sample sets","imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms","hepatitis B virus","NTCP","SRs","Ser267Phe variant","functional receptor","sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide","controls","gene\u2019s exons","PIs","regard","rs2296651","investigations","conflicting results"],"language":"en"},

Following natural infection, 10\u201370% of the infected stallions can become persistently infected and continue to shed EAV in their semen for periods ranging from several months to life. Recently, we reported that some stallions possess a subpopulation(s) of CD3(\u002B) T lymphocytes that are susceptible to in vitro EAV infection and that this phenotypic trait is associated with long-term carrier status following exposure to the virus. In contrast, stallions not possessing the CD3(\u002B) T lymphocyte susceptible phenotype are at less risk of becoming long-term virus carriers. A genome wide association study (GWAS) using the Illumina Equine SNP50 chip revealed that the ability of EAV to infect CD3(\u002B) T lymphocytes and establish long-term carrier status in stallions correlated with a region within equine chromosome 11. Here we identified the gene and mutations responsible for these phenotypes. Specifically, the work implicated three allelic variants of the equine orthologue of CXCL16 (EqCXCL16) that differ by four non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions (XM_00154756; c.715 A \u2192 T, c.801 G \u2192 C, c.804 T \u2192 A/G, c.810 G \u2192 A) within exon 1. This resulted in four amino acid changes with EqCXCL16S (XP_001504806.1) having Phe, His, Ile and Lys as compared to EqCXL16R having Tyr, Asp, Phe, and Glu at 40, 49, 50, and 52, respectively. Two alleles (EqCXCL16Sa, EqCXCL16Sb) encoded identical protein products that correlated strongly with long-term EAV persistence in stallions (P\u003C0.000001) and are required for in vitro CD3(\u002B) T lymphocyte susceptibility to EAV infection. The third (EqCXCL16R) was associated with in vitro CD3(\u002B) T lymphocyte resistance to EAV infection and a significantly lower probability for establishment of the long-term carrier state (viral persistence) in the male reproductive tract. EqCXCL16Sa and EqCXCL16Sb exert a dominant mode of inheritance. Most importantly, the protein isoform EqCXCL16S but not EqCXCL16R can function as an EAV cellular receptor. Although both molecules have equal chemoattractant potential, EqCXCL16S has significantly higher scavenger receptor and adhesion properties compared to EqCXCL16R.","publish_time":"2016-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarkar, Sanjay; Bailey, Ernest; Go, Yun Young; Cook, R.

METHODS: HRV specimens were prospectively obtained from a cohort of childcare attendees at enrollment and weekly during respiratory illness. The 5\u2032 noncoding region sequences were used to determine HRV species (A, B, C) and genotypes. RESULTS: Among 225 children followed, sequence data were available for 92 HRV infections: HRV-A (n = 80; 59%) was most common, followed by HRV-C (n = 52, 39%), and HRV-B (n = 3, 2%). Forty-one genotypes were identified and cocirculation was common. Frequent spread between classrooms occurred with 2 HRV-A genotypes. Repeated detections within single illnesses were a combination of persistent (n = 7) and distinct (n = 7) genotypes. Prevalence of HRV among asymptomatic children was 41%. HRV-C was clinically similar to HRV-A and HRV-B. CONCLUSIONS: HRV epidemiology in childcare consists of heterotypic cocirculation of genotypes with periodic spread within and among classrooms.

The effect of newly discovered viruses on asthma control is less well defined. Objective We sought to determine the contribution of respiratory viruses to asthma exacerbations in children with a panel of PCR assays for common and newly discovered respiratory viruses. Methods Respiratory specimens from children aged 2 to 17 years with asthma exacerbations (case patients, n = 65) and with well-controlled asthma (control subjects, n = 77), frequency matched by age and season of enrollment, were tested for rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and human bocavirus. Results Infection with respiratory viruses was associated with asthma exacerbations (63.1% in case patients vs 23.4% in control subjects; odds ratio, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.7- 11.6). Rhinovirus was by far the most prevalent virus (60% among case patients vs 18.2% among control subjects) and the only virus significantly associated with exacerbations (odds ratio, 6.8; 95% CI, 3.2-14.5). However, in children without clinically manifested viral respiratory tract illness, the prevalence of rhinovirus infection was similar in case patients (29.2%) versus control subjects (23.4%, P \u003E .05). Other viruses detected included human metapneumovirus (4.6% in patients with acute asthma vs 2.6% in control subjects), enteroviruses (4.6% vs 0%), coronavirus 229E (0% vs 1.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (1.5% vs 0%). Conclusion Symptomatic rhinovirus infections are an important contributor to asthma exacerbations in children. Clinical implications These results support the need for therapies effective against rhinovirus as a means to decrease asthma exacerbations.","publish_time":"2007-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khetsuriani, Nino; Kazerouni, N.

Methods We performed a Google TrendsTM search for \u201CCoronavirus\u201D and compared Relative Search Volumes (RSV) indices to the number of reported COVID-19 cases by the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) using time-lag correlation analysis. Results Worldwide public interest in Coronavirus reached its first peak end of January when numbers of newly infected patients started to increase exponentially in China. The worldwide Google TrendsTM index reached its peak on the 12th of March 2020 at a time when numbers of infected patients started to increase in Europe and COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. At this time the general interest in China but also the Republic of Korea has already been significantly decreased as compared to end of January. Correlations between RSV indices and number of new COVID-19 cases were observed across all investigated countries with highest correlations observed with a time lag of -11.5 days, i.e. highest interest in coronavirus observed 11.5 days before the peak of newly infected cases. This pattern was very consistent across European countries but also holds true for the US. In Brazil and Australia, highest correlations were observed with a time lag of -7 days. In Egypt the highest correlation is given with a time lag of 0, potentially indicating that in this country, numbers of newly infected patients will increase exponentially within the course of April. Conclusions Public interest indicated by RSV indices can help to monitor the progression of an outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Public interest is on average highest 11.5 days before the peak of newly infected cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Effenberger, Maria; Kronbichler, Andreas; Shin, Jae Il; Mayer, Gert; Tilg, Herbert; Perco, Paul","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daf3dbc90ef9cbe93db1bf188587303335583fdc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305520/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302496?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google","European Center for Disease Control","RSV"],"locations":["Europe","China","Republic","Brazil","Australia"],"keyphrases":["time lag","highest correlations","numbers of infected patients","days","actual number of infected cases","RSV indices","peak end","number of new COVID","number of reported COVID","coronavirus infections","European countries","current COVID","association of public","Conclusions Public","selected countries","investigated countries","Google TrendsTM search","China","pandemic","worldwide Google TrendsTM index","European Center","correlation analysis","Relative Search Volumes","ECDC","Disease Control","outbreak","pattern","Methods","Brazil","Australia","globe","country","Abstract Objectives","Republic of Korea","progression","Egypt","Results","course"],"language":"en"},

Nucleic acid testing (NAT) is the preferred method for the detection of MERS\u2010CoV. A single round of a Proficiency Testing Program (PTP) was used to assess the capability of laboratories globally to accurately detect the presence of MERS\u2010CoV using NAT. A panel of eleven lyophilized specimens containing different viral loads of MERS\u2010CoV, common coronaviruses, and in vitro RNA transcripts was distributed to laboratories in all six World Health Organization regions. A total of 96 laboratories from 79 countries participating in the PTP, with 76 of 96 (79.2%) reporting correct MERS\u2010CoV results for all nine scored specimens. A further 10 laboratories (10.4%) scored correctly in eight of nine specimens of the PTP. The majority of laboratories demonstrated satisfactory performance in detecting the presence of MERS\u2010CoV using NAT. However, some laboratories require improved assay sensitivity, reduced cross contamination of samples, and improved speciation of coronavirus subtypes for potentially complex clinical specimens. Further PTP and enhanced links with expert laboratories globally may improve the laboratory performance.","publish_time":"2018-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Theis, Torsten; Lau, Katherine A.; Gray, Joanna L.; Oxenford, Christopher J.; Walker, Gregory J.; Rawlinson, William D.","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/289e60f45e35694a7943a6536d25f1b293b28c5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166925.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30016543/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25266","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Proficiency Testing Program","NAT","World Health Organization","PTP"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["presence of MERS","expert laboratories","majority of laboratories","capability of laboratories","PTP","detection of MERS","correct MERS","CoV results","scored specimens","lyophilized specimens","different viral loads of MERS","complex clinical specimens","laboratory performance","countries","improved speciation of coronavirus subtypes","satisfactory performance","improved assay sensitivity","Proficiency Testing Program","Nucleic acid testing","reported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","cross contamination of samples","common coronaviruses","infection","panel","preferred method","single round","RNA transcripts","enhanced links","World Health Organization regions","Saudi Arabia","deaths","cases","total","time"],"language":"en"},

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most devastating viral pathogens of swine and has a substantial economic impact on the global pork industry. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai extract (SQE) inhibits PRRSV infection in cultured porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Our results demonstrated that SQE treatment suppressed the replication of PRRSV in a dose-dependent manner. The antiviral activity of SQE on PRRSV replication was found to be primarily exerted at early times postinfection. Treatment with SQE resulted in marked reduction of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny virus production. Notably, pro-inflammatory cytokine production in PAM cells infected with PRRSV was shown to be modulated in the presence of SQE. Taken together, our data indicate that SQE has potential as a therapeutic agent against PRRSV.

Political influences on outbreak preparedness, response and reporting may also adversely affect control of SARS-CoV-2 in Syria. Syria reported its first case on 22 March 2020 however concerns were raised that this was delayed and that underreporting continues. Main Syria\u0027s conflict has displaced more than half its pre-war population leaving 6.7 million people internally displaced; consequent overcrowding with insufficient water, sanitation and healthcare (including laboratory capacity) could lead to conditions which are ideal for spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Syria. Political changes have led to the formation of at least three health systems within Syria\u0027s borders, each with their own governance, capacity and planning. This fragmentation with little interaction between them could lead to poor resource allocation and adversely affect control. As such, COVID-19 could overwhelm the health systems (particularly intensive care capacity) leading to high deaths across the population, particularly for the most vulnerable such as detainees. Conclusions Locally implementable interventions which rapidly build WASH and health system capacity are required across Syria to ensure early detection and management of COVID-19 cases.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abbara, Aula; Rayes, Diana; Fahham, Ola; Alhiraki, Omar Alrashid; Khalil, Munzer; Alomar, Abdulrahman; Tarakji, Ahmad","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f21dc2f5bb84cda75094ac8b174576154af39350.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389845/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303088; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303088?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Syria"],"keyphrases":["health systems","health system capacity","health emergency","laboratory capacity","International Health Regulations","intensive care capacity","control of SARS","SARS-CoV","Main Syria\u0027s conflict","thirds of countries","Political influences","management of COVID","Syria\u0027s borders","Political changes","pre-war population","sanitation","consequent overcrowding","insufficient water","outbreak preparedness","response","people","healthcare","WASH","high deaths","reporting","early detection","formation","implementable interventions","poor resource allocation","Abstract Introduction","governance","conditions","little interaction","fragmentation","Conclusions","cases","planning","concerns","detainees"],"language":"en"},

We previously have demonstrated that proteins expressedin vitrofrom a cDNA clone of the 3CLpro region possess proteinase activity, and that the proteinase is able to cleave substratein trans.We sought to determine if the 27-kDain vitrocleavage product (p27) was an active form of the 3CLpro and whether this was consistent with the 3CLpro expressed in virus-infected cells. Antibodies directed against the 3CLpro domain detected 27-kDa MHV proteinsin vitroand in MHV-A59-infected cells. The 27-kDa proteins were able to cleave substratein transwithout other protein cofactors or supplemental membranes, and the p27 proteinase activity was retained after purification by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. When p27 was expressedin vitrowith portions of the amino- and carboxy-terminal flanking domains (MP1 and MP2), p27 was not liberated byciscleavage. The proteolytic activity of the 27-kDa proteins was inhibited by a variety of cysteine and serine proteinase inhibitors, and was eliminated by the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64d.

Objective To conduct a systematic review of previously reported cases of psoriasis onset, exacerbation, or relapse after HCQ treatment. Methods A comprehensive EMBASE and MEDLINE search of original studies examining adverse effects of HCQ treatment related to psoriasis was conducted. Participant demographics, and details of HCQ administration and psoriasis diagnosis were extracted from 15 articles representing 18 patients. Results Females accounted for a significantly larger number of psoriatic cases compared to males and unreported sex (n=14, 77.8% vs. n=2, 11.1% vs n=2, 11.1% respectively). Additionally, 50% (n=9) of the cases did not have a history of psoriasis prior to taking HCQ. Of the 18 patients, 50.0% (n=9) experienced de novo psoriasis, 27.8% (n=5) experienced exacerbation of psoriatic symptoms and 22.2% (n=4) had a relapse of psoriasis after HCQ administration.

We recently studied the global distribution of protein domain structures in thousands of completely sequenced viral and cellular proteomes with comparative genomics, phylogenomics, and multidimensional scaling methods. A tree of life describing the evolution of proteomes revealed viruses emerging from the base of the tree as a fourth supergroup of life. A tree of domains indicated an early origin of modern viral lineages from ancient cells that co-existed with the cellular ancestors. However, it was recently argued that the rooting of our trees and the basal placement of viruses was artifactually induced by small genome (proteome) size. Here we show that these claims arise from misunderstanding and misinterpretations of cladistic methodology. Trees are reconstructed unrooted, and thus, their topologies cannot be distorted a posteriori by the rooting methodology. Tracing proteome size in trees and multidimensional views of evolutionary relationships as well as tests of leaf stability and exclusion/inclusion of taxa demonstrated that the smallest proteomes were neither attracted toward the root nor caused any topological distortions of the trees. Simulations confirmed that taxa clustering patterns were independent of proteome size and were determined by the presence of known evolutionary relatives in data matrices, highlighting the need for broader taxon sampling in phylogeny reconstruction. Instead, phylogenetic tracings of proteome size revealed a slowdown in innovation of the structural domain vocabulary and four regimes of allometric scaling that reflected a Heaps law. These regimes explained increasing economies of scale in the evolutionary growth and accretion of kernel proteome repertoires of viruses and cellular organisms that resemble growth of human languages with limited vocabulary sizes. Results reconcile dynamic and static views of domain frequency distributions that are consistent with the axiom of spatiotemporal continuity that is tenet of evolutionary thinking.","publish_time":"2017-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nasir, Arshan; Kim, Kyung Mo; Caetano-Anoll\u00E9s, Gustavo","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a259f7115e26c97fee193b205ec7542b1267829b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5481351.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28690608/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01178","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["trees","independent of proteome size","Tracing proteome size","evolutionary growth","cellular proteomes","evolution of viruses","phylogenetic tracings of proteome size","evolutionary relatives","evolution of proteomes","tree of life","accretion of kernel proteome repertoires of viruses","multidimensional views of evolutionary relationships","cellular organisms","structural domain vocabulary","cellular ancestors","tenet of evolutionary thinking","basal placement of viruses","smallest proteomes","tree of domains","rooting methodology","multidimensional scaling methods","regimes of allometric scaling","static views of domain frequency distributions","inclusion of taxa","supergroup of life","early origin of modern viral lineages","global distribution of protein domain structures","growth of human languages","limited vocabulary sizes","misinterpretations of cladistic methodology","thousands","phylogenomics","comparative genomics","need","ancient cells","slowdown","innovation","broader taxon sampling","axiom of spatiotemporal continuity","tests of leaf stability","exclusion","data matrices","increasing economies of scale","patterns","phylogeny reconstruction","misunderstanding","presence","small genome","Heaps law","Results","topological distortions","posteriori","challenging proposition","base","topologies","claims","Simulations"],"language":"en"},

Contemparaneous laboratory diagnosis has not been available previously. Objectives: To assess the proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) attributable to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and picornavirus infection during the winter season. To compare the influenza PCR data with serology of paired blood samples. Study design: Combined nose and throat swabs, from patients with ILI attending 15 general practices across Scotland, were submitted to the laboratory in virus PCR sample solution (VPSS). The extracted nucleic acid was tested using a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Serological analysis was performed on paired serum samples using complement fixation assays. The rate of influenza virus positivity was compared with reports of ILI obtained from the SSGP network. Results: Of 240 samples received at the laboratory, 132 (55%) were PCR positive for influenza A virus. There were nine (3.8%) picornavirus and three (1.2%) RSV PCR positives, two (0.8%) were dual influenza A/picornavirus infections. Ninety four (39.2%) were negative for all viruses tested. Results on paired sera from 89 patients showed a rising titre to influenza A in 48 of the 57 PCR positive samples (84.2%). One PCR negative patient displayed a significant rising titre to influenza A. Virological data paralleled the SSGP data but was available at least a week earlier. Conclusions: Influenza A infection was detected in the majority of patients with ILI; picornavirus infection was also shown to be an important cause of illness. PCR is a rapid and sensitive method for respiratory virus surveillance. Serology is slow, insensitive and difficult to interpret at low titres.","publish_time":"2004-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wallace, Lesley A.; Collins, Terry C.; Douglas, James D.M.; McIntyre, Sheena; Millar, John; Carman, William F.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6ae8afd89a278eb8d96cfc058988f99782e1645.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129821.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653203003305; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653203003305","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

The unique structure and heart myocyte restricted expression of cTnI and cTnT led to their worldwide use as biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) beginning more than 30 years ago. Over these years, high sensitivity antibodies (hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT) have been developed. Together with careful determination of history, physical examination, and EKG, determination of serum levels using hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT permits risk stratification of patients presenting in the Emergency Department (ED) with chest pain. With the ability to determine serum levels of these troponins with high sensitivity came the question of whether such measurements may be of diagnostic and prognostic value in conditions beyond AMI. Moreover, the finding of elevated serum troponins in physiological states such as exercise and pathological states where cardiac myocytes may be affected requires understanding of how troponins may be released into the blood and whether such release may be benign. We consider these questions by relating membrane stability to the complex biology of troponin with emphasis on its sensitivity to the chemo-mechanical and micro-environment of the cardiac myocyte. We also consider the role determinations of serum troponins play in the precise phenotyping in personalized and precision medicine approaches to promote cardiac health.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Solaro, Christopher R.; Solaro, R.

Little splenic virus derived from SSM, arguing that they mainly induce an anti-viral state in the otherwise susceptible FRC. NK cells also limited infection, killing infected FRC and causing tissue damage. They acted independently of IFN-I, as IFNAR blockade increased NK cell recruitment, and NK cell depletion increased infection in IFNAR-blocked mice. Thus SSM restricted MCMV infection primarily though IFN-I, with NK cells providing a second line of defence.

There is a need to better describe the epidemiology of viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in developing countries. METHODS: From July 2004 to June 2007, we examined nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from 2,230 cases of pneumonia (World Health Organization criteria) in children 2 to 35 months old recruited in a randomized trial of zinc supplementation at a field clinic in Bhaktapur, Nepal. The specimens were examined for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A (InfA) and B (InfB), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) using a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: We identified 919 virus isolates in 887 (40.0%) of the 2,219 NPA specimens with a valid PCR result, of which 334 (15.1%) yielded RSV, 164 (7.4%) InfA, 129 (5.8%) PIV3, 98 (4.4%) PIV1, 93 (4.2%) hMPV, 84 (3.8%) InfB, and 17 (0.8%) PIV2. CAP occurred in an epidemic pattern with substantial temporal variation during the three years of study. The largest peaks of pneumonia occurrence coincided with peaks of RSV infection, which occurred in epidemics during the rainy season and in winter. The monthly number of RSV infections was positively correlated with relative humidity (r(s )= 0.40, P = 0.01), but not with temperature or rainfall. An hMPV epidemic occurred during one of the three winter seasons and the monthly number of hMPV cases was also associated with relative humidity (r(s )= 0.55, P = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Respiratory RNA viruses were detected from NPA in 40% of CAP cases in our study. The most commonly isolated viruses were RSV, InfA, and PIV3. RSV infections contributed substantially to the observed CAP epidemics. The occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro-epidemics with several respiratory viruses, highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures.","publish_time":"2009-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mathisen, Maria; Strand, Tor A; Sharma, Biswa N; Chandyo, Ram K; Valentiner-Branth, Palle; Basnet, Sudha; Adhikari, Ramesh K; Hvidsten, Dag; Shrestha, Prakash S; Sommerfelt, Halvor","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff4fffe02138b0b232334d997965d11fd936916b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2727531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19635124/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-7-35","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPA","RSV","CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CAP cases","cases of pneumonia","respiratory viruses","peaks of RSV infection","monthly number of RSV infections","occurrence of viral CAP","observed CAP epidemics","hMPV epidemic","PIV3","monthly number of hMPV cases","respiratory syncytial virus","virus isolates","NPA specimens","Respiratory RNA viruses","largest peaks of pneumonia occurrence","children","relative humidity","parainfluenza virus types","isolated viruses","years of study","InfB","PIV1","PIV2","overlapping micro-epidemics","epidemiology of viral community","epidemic pattern","years of age","winter seasons","developing countries","valid PCR result","World Health Organization criteria","effective public health control measures","multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","field clinic","randomized trial of zinc supplementation","substantial temporal variation","death","main causes of illness","Bhaktapur","months old","assay","challenges","human metapneumovirus","Nepal","rainy season","CONCLUSION","nasopharyngeal aspirates","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","temperature","rainfall","need","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Firstly, viruses appear to be polyphyletic in origin, with several sets of viruses arising by different, independent routes at different times. Secondly, subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different host/vector combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution, with these additional gene modules coming from other viruses or host genetic material. Thus, depending on the gene product used for comparison, different phylogenetic relationships can be deduced. Further virus adaptation can arise by reassortment of segmented genomes, gene duplication, deletions, frameshift mutations, point mutations or de novo development of new gene products from existing, unused reading frames. The solution to the first objection is to place all viruses in a separate kingdom and assign the current viruses to several phyla that reflect these diverse origins. The solution to the second objection is to consider the core module of replication machinery as the major criterion on which to make the initial assignments to classes and orders. For RNA viruses, the major criterion is the sequence identity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using this criterion, the positive strand RNA viruses can be assigned to five classes that correspond to the recently recognized supergroups of RNA viruses. These five classes contain four, three, three, three and one order(s) respectively. These fourteen orders contain 31 virus families (including 17 families of plant viruses) and 48 genera (including 30 genera of plant viruses). This approach confirms the separation of the alphaviruses and flaviviruses into two families, the Togaviridae and Flaviridae, but suggests that several other current taxonomic assignments, such as the pestiviruses, hepatitis C virus, rubiviruses, hepatitis E virus and arteriviruses, may be wrong. The coronaviruses and toroviruses appear to be distinct families in distinct orders, not distinct genera of the same family as currently classified. In addition, the luteoviruses are split into two families and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus appears not to be a closterovirus but a new genus of the Potexviridae. From an analysis of the polymerase dendrograms of the dsRNA viruses, it appears that they are not closely related to each other, but belong to four additional classes (Partitiviridae, Reoviridae, Birnaviridae and Cystoviridae) and one additional order (Totiviridae) of one of the classes of positive ssRNA viruses in the same subphylum as the positive strand RNA viruses. The negative strand virus polymerase relationships confirm the assignment of the negative strand viruses to two orders in a single class in a separate subphylum of the RNA viruses. This review includes preliminary data suggesting that the DNA viruses can also be assigned to higher taxa on the basis of the sequence identities of their highly conserved DNA polymerases. The suggested use of viral polymerases to establish higher order relationships is similar in principle to the use of highly conserved ribosomal RNA gene sequences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxonomy. This review also discusses the assignment of 33 of the 35 groups of plant viruses into genera of 25 families based on the nature of the genome and its arrangement, the level of sequence identity and, to a lesser extent, particle morphology.","publish_time":"1993-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ward, C.

In the wake of the January 2010 earthquake, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population collaborated with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Pan American Health Organization, and other local and international partners to implement a functional national surveillance system. More than 7 years later, it is important to take the opportunity to reflect on progress made on surveillance and response in Haiti, including disease detection, reporting, outbreak investigation, and response. The national epidemiologic surveillance network that started with 51 sites in 2010 has been expanded to 357 sites as of December 2015. Disease outbreaks identified via the surveillance system, or other surveillance approaches, are investigated by epidemiologists trained by the Ministry of Health\u2019s Field Epidemiology Training Program.

Furthermore, the majority of amino acid sequences adopted codons unequally in all viruses, but the numbers of common preferred codons between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species were not significantly different from the differences observed between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by different insect species. In addition, the amino acids that adopt the same synonymous codon composition between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species were statistically as few as those between alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by different insect species. Correspondence analysis revealed that no major factors resulted in the codon bias in these baculoviruses, implying multiple minor influential factors exist. Neutrality plot analysis indicated that selection pressure dominated mutations in shaping the codon usage. However, the levels of selection pressure were not significantly different among viruses hosted by the same insect species. We expect that evolution would cause the alpha- and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species to share more patterns, but this effect was not observed.","publish_time":"2016-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Sheng-Lin; Jiang, Yi-Ren; Yang, Rui-Sheng; Wang, Yong; Qin, Li","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/701f1d00833146037c3d82f69df03c7969211d1a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b3d6575290833110d9ad6b098d82e5f3c1536cd8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106102.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713481630332X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156713481630332X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.07.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27484795/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different insect species","betabaculoviruses","codon usage patterns","host species","synonymous codon usage bias","synonymous codon composition","general weak trend of codon bias","betabaculovirus pairs","Mutations","selection shapes","levels of selection pressure","differences of ENc","effective number of codons","nucleotide contents","ENc value","numbers of common preferred codons","major factors","Correspondence analysis","amino acids","impacts of nucleotide content","Neutrality plot analysis","Lepidopteran-specific Alphabaculovirus","multiple minor influential factors","majority of amino acid sequences","certain organism genomes","values","large genera","family of Baculoviridae","addition","alphabaculoviruses","study","results","evolution"],"language":"en"},

Preliminary observations suggested a higher clinical severity in children infected with this new genotype. We investigated spread and disease severity of RSV-A ON1 in pediatric in- and outpatient settings. METHODS: During 2010/11 to 2016/17, clinical characteristics and respiratory samples from children with acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) were obtained from ongoing surveillance studies in 33 pediatric practices (PP), one pediatric hospital ward (PW) and 23 pediatric intensive care units (PICU) in Germany. RSV was detected in the respiratory samples by PCR; genotypes were identified by sequencing. Within each setting, clinical severity markers were compared between RSV-A ON1 and RSV-A non-ON1 genotypes. RESULTS: A total of 603 children with RSV-RTI were included (132 children in PP, 288 in PW, and 183 in PICU). Of these children, 341 (56.6%) were infected with RSV-A, 235 (39.0%) with RSV-B, and one child (0.2%) with both RSV-A and RSV-B; in 26 (4.3%) children, the subtype could not be identified. In the 341 RSV-A positive samples, genotype ON1 was detected in 247 (72.4%), NA1 in 92 (26.9%), and GA5 in 2 children (0.6%). RSV-A ON1, rarely observed in 2011/12, was the predominant RSV-A genotype in all settings by 2012/13 and remained predominant until 2016/17. Children in PP or PW infected with RSV-A ON1 did not show a more severe clinical course of disease compared with RSV-A non-ON1 infections. In the PICU group, hospital stay was one day longer (median 8 days, inter-quartile range (IQR) 7\u201312 vs. 7 days, IQR 5\u20139; p = 0.02) and duration of oxygen treatment two days longer (median 6 days, IQR 4\u20139 vs. 4 days, IQR 2\u20136; p = 0.03) for children infected with RSV-A ON1. CONCLUSIONS: In children, RSV-A ON1 largely replaced RSV-A non-ON1 genotypes within two seasons and remained the predominant RSV-A genotype in Germany during subsequent seasons. A higher clinical severity of RSV-A ON1 was observed within the group of children receiving PICU treatment, whereas in other settings clinical severity of RSV-A ON1 and non-ON1 genotypes was largely similar.

It stimulated interest in the question about the origin of life and its evolution. Here, we discuss what the roles of viruses might have been at the beginning of life and during evolution. Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth. They are present everywhere, in our surrounding, the oceans, the soil and in every living being. Retroviruses contributed to about half of our genomic sequences and to the evolution of the mammalian placenta. Contemporary viruses reflect evolution ranging from the RNA world to the DNA-protein world. How far back can we trace their contribution? Earliest replicating and evolving entities are the ribozymes or viroids fulfilling several criteria of life. RNA can perform many aspects of life and influences our gene expression until today. The simplest structures with non-protein-coding information may represent models of life built on structural, not genetic information. Viruses today are obligatory parasites depending on host cells. Examples of how an independent lifestyle might have been lost include mitochondria, chloroplasts, Rickettsia and others, which used to be autonomous bacteria and became intracellular parasites or endosymbionts, thereby losing most of their genes. Even in vitro the loss of genes can be recapitulated all the way from coding to non-coding RNA. Furthermore, the giant viruses may indicate that there is no sharp border between living and non-living entities but an evolutionary continuum. Here, it is discussed how viruses can lose and gain genes, and that they are essential drivers of evolution. This discussion may stimulate the thinking about viruses as early possible forms of life.

In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR)were a concern. We sought to describe platelet feature of these cases. METHODS Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease(COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospitalfrom January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analysed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laborotary results and treatment date were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and non-severe patients were compared. RESULTS Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients,multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were longer than those without platelet peaks(P\u003C0.05).The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were older than those without platelet peaks(P\u003C0.05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. CONCLUSION Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have suggestion on the severity and prognosis of disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization day may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

In response to variations in the extracellular environment, the collective behavior of cell populations can be coordinated by regulating community-level gene expression. This mechanism is strongly conserved during evolution, being shared both by bacterial communities and central nervous system cells. Notably, cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are molecules that are implicated in these quorum sensing behaviors in both settings. Bacteria coordinate their collective behavior by producing CDPs (quorum sensing inducers) that enhance the capacity of individual members of the community to detect these signals and thus amplify the community-level response. In this review, we highlight recent data indicating that strikingly similar molecular mechanisms control communications between glial and neuronal cells to maintain homeostasis in the central nervous system, with a specific focus on the role of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone\u2014derived CDP cyclo(His-Pro) in the protection against neurotoxic insults.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bellezza, Ilaria; Peirce, Matthew J.; Minelli, Alba","journal":"Quorum Sensing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdf3376c91559ca7269a1a31b2e67693d8439f1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150082.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128149058000101; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128149058000101","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["communities of cells","community-level response","central nervous system cells","neuronal cells","CDPs","community-level gene expression","quorum sensing inducers","quorum sensing behaviors","bacterial communities","collective behavior of cell populations","similar molecular mechanisms","communications","homeostasis","crucial prerequisite","independent organisms","extracellular environment","hormone","thyrotropin","specific focus","derived CDP cyclo","recent data","role","molecules","capacity of individual members","species survival","protection","cyclic dipeptides","variations","settings","neurotoxic insults","Abstract Communication","evolution","review","signals"],"language":"en"},

Many of these deadly infectious diseases that have epidemic potential can become global health emergencies in the absence of effective vaccines. But very few vaccines against these threats have been developed to create proven medical products. The measles vaccine is an efficient, live attenuated, replicating virus that has been safely administered to 2 billion children over the last 40 years, affording life-long protection after a single dose. Taking advantage of these characteristics, this attenuated virus was transformed into a versatile chimeric or recombinant vaccine vector with demonstrated proof-of-principle in humans and a preclinical track record of rapid adaptability and effectiveness for a variety of pathogens. Clinical trials have shown the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine platform in individuals with preexisting immunity to measles.

The optimal modalities of antimicrobial therapy remain to be determined. Our objective was to describe the epidemiology and prognostic factors associated with S. maltophilia pneumonia, focusing on antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: This nationwide retrospective study included all patients admitted to 25 French mixed intensive care units between 2012 and 2017 with hospital-acquired S. maltophilia HAP during intensive care unit stay. Primary endpoint was time to in-hospital death. Secondary endpoints included microbiologic effectiveness and antimicrobial therapeutic modalities such as delay to appropriate antimicrobial treatment, mono versus combination therapy, and duration of antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Of the 282 patients included, 84% were intubated at S. maltophilia HAP diagnosis for duration of 11 [5\u201318] days. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 47 [36\u201363], and the in-hospital mortality was 49.7%. Underlying chronic pulmonary comorbidities were present in 14.1% of cases. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was considered effective on S. maltophilia according to susceptibility patterns in only 30% of cases. Delay to appropriate antimicrobial treatment had, however, no significant impact on the primary endpoint. Survival analysis did not show any benefit from combination antimicrobial therapy (HR = 1.27, 95%CI [0.88; 1.83], p = 0.20) or prolonged antimicrobial therapy for more than 7 days (HR = 1.06, 95%CI [0.6; 1.86], p = 0.84). No differences were noted in in-hospital death irrespective of an appropriate and timely empiric antimicrobial therapy between mono- versus polymicrobial S. maltophilia HAP (p = 0.273). The duration of ventilation prior to S. maltophilia HAP diagnosis and ICU length of stay were shorter in patients with monomicrobial S. maltophilia HAP (p = 0.031 and p = 0.034 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: S. maltophilia HAP occurred in severe, long-stay intensive care patients who mainly required prolonged invasive ventilation. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was barely effective while antimicrobial treatment modalities had no significant impact on hospital survival.

The unavailability of a specific antiviral drug against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease has created an alarming situation to identify or develop potent chemical molecules for remedial management of CHIKV. In the present investigation, in silico studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives (5a\u2013f) with non-structural protein-3 (nsP3) were carried out. nsP3 replication protein has recently been considered as a possible antiviral target in which crucial inhibitors fit into the adenosine-binding pocket of the macrodomain. The 4\u2032-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids displayed intrinsic binding with the nsp3 macrodomain (PDB ID: 3GPO) of CHIKV. Compounds 5c and 5d showed docking scores of \u22127.54 and \u22126.86 kcal mol(\u20131), respectively. Various in vitro assays were performed to confirm their (5a\u2013f) antiviral potential against CHIKV. The non-cytotoxic dose was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and was found to be \u003C100 \u03BCM. The compounds 5c and 5d showed their inhibitory potential for CHIKV, which was determined through cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay, which show inhibition up to 95 and 92% for 70 \u03BCM concentration of the compounds, respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result confirmed the ability of 5c and 5d to reduce the viral RNA level at 70 \u03BCM concentration of compounds to nearly 95 and 93% concentration, respectively, in cells with CHIKV infection. Further, the CHIKV-inhibitory capacity of these compounds was corroborated by execution of immunofluorescence assay. The executed work will be meaningful for the future research of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids against prime antiviral entrants, leading to remedial management to preclude CHIKV infection.","publish_time":"2019-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Puranik, Ninad V.; Rani, Ruchi; Singh, Vedita Anand; Tomar, Shailly; Puntambekar, Hemalata M.; Srivastava, Pratibha","journal":"ACS Omega","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1dc3ea3a7ad4303e6e57417de0daee78e31d5bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6893968.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893968/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV infection","remedial management of CHIKV","CHIKV-inhibitory capacity","\u03BCM concentration of compounds","antiviral potential","Antiviral therapy","nsp3 macrodomain","prime antiviral entrants","specific antiviral drug","plaque reduction assay","cytopathic effect assay","possible antiviral target","diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay","execution of immunofluorescence assay","inhibitory potential","nsP3 replication protein","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result","crucial inhibitors","intrinsic binding","halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids","non-structural protein","viral RNA level","adenosine-binding pocket","circumvention of viral epidemics","future research of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids","chikungunya virus","potent chemical molecules","disease","PDB ID","silico studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives","alarming situation","text","GPO","present investigation","Image","unavailability","inhibition","docking scores","cells","executed work","non-cytotoxic dose","kcal mol","assays","dimethylthiazol"],"language":"en"},

Very few case reports in the literature have described a relationship between Graves disease and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We present a case of a patient with Graves disease who was found to be biochemically and clinically hyperthyroid with concurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 30-year-old African American woman with a history of hypertension and a family history of Graves disease who had recently been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and placed on methimazole. She presented to our hospital with the complaints of progressive shortness of breath and dizziness. Her vital signs were stable. On further evaluation, she was diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, depending on clinical and laboratory results, and also was found to have highly elevated free T4 and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone. She received multiple sessions of plasmapheresis and ultimately had a total thyroidectomy. The patient\u2019s hospital course was complicated by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Her platelets stabilized at approximately 50,000/\u03BCl, and her ADAMTS13 activity normalized despite multiple complications. The patient ultimately had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity and died despite multiple attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation. CONCLUSION: Graves disease is an uncommon trigger for the development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and very few cases have been reported thus far. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this association in the appropriate clinical context to comprehensively monitor hyperthyroid patients during treatment.","publish_time":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaughtai, Saira; Khan, Ijaz; Gupta, Varsha; Chaughtai, Zeeshan; Ong, Raquel; Asif, Arif; Hossain, Mohammad A.","journal":"J Med Case Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/775c8ddaf3694b2de176210dffc9772208f3aacd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6909611.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6909611/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","concurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","family history of Graves disease","autoimmune disease","multiple attempts","multiple complications","case reports","CASE PRESENTATION","multiple sessions of plasmapheresis","history of hypertension","ADAMTS13 activity","hyperthyroid patients","pulseless electrical activity","appropriate clinical context","patient\u2019s hospital course","pneumonia","uncommon trigger","suppressed thyroid","association","year-old African American woman","cardiac arrest","relationship","complaints of progressive shortness of breath","elevated free T4","acute respiratory distress syndrome","literature","dizziness","hormone","\u03BCl","cardiopulmonary resuscitation","high mortality","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","laboratory results","vital signs","total thyroidectomy","clinicians","treatment","cases","hyperthyroidism","methimazole","platelets","evaluation"],"language":"en"},

We searched for studies on AKI according to Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE); Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN); and/or Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria in burn patients admitted to the ICU. We collected data on AKI incidence, risk factors, use of RRT, renal recovery, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and health care costs. RESULTS: We included 33 observational studies comprising 8200 patients. Overall study quality, scored according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, was moderate. Random effect model meta-analysis revealed that the incidence of AKI among burn patients in the ICU was 38 (30\u201346) %. Patients with AKI were almost evenly distributed in the mild, moderate, and severe AKI subgroups. RRT was used in 12 (8\u201316) % of all patients. Risk factors for AKI were high age, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high Total Body Surface Area percent burnt, high Abbreviated Burn Severity Index score, inhalation injury, rhabdomyolysis, surgery, high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation. AKI patients had 8.6 (4.0\u201313.2) days longer ICU LOS and higher mortality than non-AKI patients, OR 11.3 (7.3\u201317.4). Few studies reported renal recovery, and no study reported health care costs. CONCLUSIONS: AKI occurred in 38% of burn patients admitted to the ICU, and 12% of all patients received RRT. Presence of AKI was associated with increased LOS and mortality.

The only available vaccine, bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00E9rin (BCG), has variable efficacy throughout the world. A more effective vaccine is urgently needed. The immune response against tuberculosis relies, at least in part, on CD4(\u002B) T cells. Protective vaccines require the induction of antigen-specific CD4(\u002B) T cells via mycobacterial peptides presented by MHC class-II in infected macrophages. In order to identify mycobacterial antigens bound to MHC, we have immunoprecipitated MHC class-I and class-II complexes from THP-1 macrophages infected with BCG, purified MHC class-I and MHC class-II peptides and analysed them by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We have successfully identified 94 mycobacterial peptides presented by MHC-II and 43 presented by MHC-I, from 76 and 41 antigens, respectively. These antigens were found to be highly expressed in infected macrophages. Gene ontology analysis suggests most of these antigens are associated with membranes and involved in lipid biosynthesis and transport. The sequences of selected peptides were confirmed by spectral match validation and immunogenicity evaluated by IFN-gamma ELISpot against peripheral blood mononuclear cell from volunteers vaccinated with BCG, M.tb latently infected subjects or patients with tuberculosis disease. Three antigens were expressed in viral vectors, and evaluated as vaccine candidates alone or in combination in a murine aerosol M.tb challenge model. When delivered in combination, the three candidate vaccines conferred significant protection in the lungs and spleen compared with BCG alone, demonstrating proof-of-concept for this unbiased approach to identifying new candidate antigens.","publish_time":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bettencourt, Paulo; M\u00FCller, Julius; Nicastri, Annalisa; Cantillon, Daire; Madhavan, Meera; Charles, Philip D.; Fotso, Carine B.; Wittenberg, Rachel; Bull, Naomi; Pinpathomrat, Nawamin; Waddell, Simon J.; Stylianou, Elena; Hill, Adrian V.

The brainstem is prone to various primary and secondary insults, resulting in acute or chronic dysfunction. Of particular importance for characterizing brainstem dysfunction and identifying the underlying etiology are a detailed clinical examination, MRI, neurophysiologic tests such as brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid.

Nevertheless, the risk factors for postoperative pneumonia (POP) are still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive risk factors for POP in HTx recipients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, all patients undergoing HTx between January 2014 and December 2015 were included. All cases of POP occurring until hospital discharge were investigated. The study aimed to determine risk factors using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Data are expressed in Odds Ratio [95% CI]. P \u003C 0.05 was necessary to reject the null hypothesis. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included without any patients being lost to follow-up, and 89 instances of POP were diagnosed in 59 (34%) patients. Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common pathogens. In the multivariate analysis, the risk factors were preoperative mechanical ventilation (OR 1.42 [1.12\u20131.80], P \u003C 0.01) and perioperative blood transfusion (OR 1.42 [95% CI: 1.20\u20131.70], P \u003C 0.01). POP significantly impacted mortality at 30 days (OR: 4 [1.3\u201312.4], P = 0.01) and 1 year (OR: 6.8 [2.5\u20138.4], P \u003C 0.01) and was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, time to weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and stay in an intensive care unit. Plasma exchanges and intravenous administration of immunoglobulins did not increase the risk of POP. CONCLUSION: After HTx, preoperative mechanical ventilation and blood transfusion were risk factors for POP and were associated with increased mortality. Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common pathogens of POP.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vidal, Charles; Pasqualotto, Romain; James, Arthur; Dureau, Pauline; Rasata, Julie; Coutance, Guillaume; Varnous, Shaida; Leprince, Pascal; Amour, Julien; Bougl\u00E9, Adrien","journal":"BMC Anesthesiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a71c4aea97f1e1fd9cd4123b393ed045d2e2c2a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6947950.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947950/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzEzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of POP","patients","instances of POP","predictive risk factors","common pathogens of POP","cases of POP occurring","preoperative mechanical ventilation","HTx recipients","longer duration of mechanical ventilation","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","retrospective study","impacted mortality","increased mortality","Enterobacteriaceae","perioperative blood transfusion","multivariate analysis","postoperative pneumonia","multivariate Cox regression models","time","frequent complication","heart transplantation","venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","intravenous administration of immunoglobulins","Plasma exchanges","hospital discharge","morbidity","intensive care unit","Odds Ratio","BACKGROUND","days","CONCLUSION","follow-up","null hypothesis","Data","population","METHODS","RESULTS","total","aim","year"],"language":"en"},

There has been little evaluation of how the content of news published during an outbreak varies by location of the news outlet. This study analyzes coverage of the 2014 Ebola outbreak by one news outlet operating within a country affected by the outbreak and one country not directly affected. METHODS: A qualitative content analysis was conducted of articles published in two national news outlets, The Globe and Mail (Canada) and the Vanguard (Nigeria), between January 1 and December 31, 2014. Articles available through LexisNexis Academic were sorted by date and sampled using a stratified sampling method (The Globe and Mail n = 100; Vanguard n = 105). A coding scheme was developed and modified to incorporate emerging themes until saturation was achieved. RESULTS: There were substantial differences in outbreak coverage in terms of the topic and content of the articles, as well as the sources consulted. The Globe and Mail framed the outbreak in terms of national security and national interests, as well as presenting it as an international humanitarian crisis.

However, the use of restrictive measures is not without controversy, as there is no agreed-upon threshold for when and how to invoke restrictive measures. The objectives of this study are to solicit perspectives from Canadians on the ethical considerations of using restrictive measures in response to influenza pandemics, and in turn, to use public views to contribute to a better understanding of what is considered to be the justifiable use of restrictive measures. METHODS: A series of town hall focus groups with Canadian residents from June 2008 to May 2009, in three Canadian regions, in order to achieve broad public engagement (n=3 focus groups with a total of 17 participants). RESULTS: Two key themes emerged from all town hall focus groups: 1) create an environment for compliance through communication rather than enforcement, and 2) establish the delineation between individual rights, community values, and the greater good. CONCLUSION: While there is a need for a decision-making authority and even a mechanism for enforcement, our data suggest that a more tractable approach to restrictive measures is one that enables individuals to voluntarily comply by creating an environment to compel compliance based on communication. This approach requires restrictive measures to be a) proportional to the threat, b) implemented along with reciprocal arrangements provided to those affected, and c) accompanied by open and transparent communication throughout all stages so that citizens can both understand and participate in decision-making.","publish_time":"2012-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Maxwell J.; Bensimon, C\u00E9cile M.; Perez, Daniel F.; Sahni, Sachin S.; Upshur, Ross E.

METHODS: Answers from CDH survivors were collected through an online questionnaire (SurveyMonkey(\u00AE)) undertaken by CDH UK. The questionnaire contained questions about their feeding problems and support they were receiving for it. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, 151 patients answered some parts of the survey and 102 patients completed the questionnaire. Overall, 116 (76.8%) responders reported suffering from any type of feeding issue. Gastric acid reflux (GER) and growth retardation were the commonest symptoms experienced by 97 (91.5%) and 72 (62.2%) responders, respectively. Only 18 (17.0%) responders have received any written information on feeding or details of patient/parent support. Eighty (75.5%) responders are satisfied with the level of support they are receiving, but 78 (76.4%) answered that the whole experience associated with the disease has been very or extremely stressful.

In this paper, we address this challenge by solving a multi-tasking problem from the captured surveillance videos. This multi-tasking framework aims to model the principle of Close Proximity Interaction and thus infer the infection risk of individuals. The complete workflow includes three essential sub-tasks: (1) person re-identification (REID), to identify the diagnosed patient and infected individuals across different cameras, (2) depth estimation, to provide a spatial knowledge of the captured environment, (3) pose estimation, to evaluate the distance between the diagnosed and potentially-infected subjects. Our method significantly reduces the time and labor costs. We demonstrate the advantages of high accuracy and efficiency of our method.

Levofloxacin (LOF) is an ideal anti-tuberculosis drug in clinical applications. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis in TB treatment have not been revealed. Our study performed transcriptome and methylome sequencing to investigate the potential biological characteristics of LOF resistance in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. In the transcriptome analysis, 953 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified; 514 and 439 DEGs were significantly downregulated and upregulated in the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 97 pathways were enriched in this study. In the methylome analysis, 239 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified; 150 and 89 DMGs were hypomethylated and hypermethylated in the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 74 pathways were enriched in this study. The overlap study suggested that 25 genes were obtained. It was notable that nine genes expressed downregulated mRNA and upregulated methylated levels, including pgi, fadE4, php, cyp132, pckA, rpmB1, pfkB, acg, and ctpF, especially cyp132, pckA, and pfkB, which were vital in LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The overlapping genes between transcriptome and methylome could be essential for studying the molecular mechanisms of LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv. These results may provide informative evidence for TB treatment with LOF.

NPC1 receptor expression in the context of ebolavirus replication in microbat cells remains unstudied. In order to study Ebola virus (EBOV) cellular entry and replication in M. condylurus, we derived primary and immortalized cell cultures from 12 different organs. The NPC1 receptor expression was characterized by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry comparing the expression levels of M. condylurus primary and immortalized cells, HeLa cells, human embryonic kidney cells and cells from a European microbat species. EBOV replication kinetics was studied for four representative cell cultures using qRT-PCR. The aim was to elucidate the suitability of primary and immortalized cells from different tissues for studying NPC1 receptor expression levels and their potential influence on EBOV replication. The NPC1 receptor expression level in M. condylurus primary cells differed depending on the organ they were derived from and was for most cell types significantly lower than in human cell lines. Immortalized cells showed for most cell types higher expression levels than their corresponding primary cells. Concluding from our infection experiments with EBOV we suggest a potential correlation between NPC1 receptor expression level and virus replication rate in vitro.","publish_time":"2020-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bokelmann, Marcel; Edenborough, Kathryn; Hetzelt, Nicole; Kreher, Petra; Lander, Angelika; Nitsche, Andreas; Vogel, Uwe; Feldmann, Heinz; Couacy-Hymann, Emmanuel; Kurth, Andreas","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6994141.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6994141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immortalized cells","condylurus primary cells","microbat cells","NPC1 receptor expression levels","HeLa cells","corresponding primary cells","immortalized cell cultures","cell types higher expression levels","human cell lines","human embryonic kidney cells","EBOV replication kinetics","suitability of primary","representative cell cultures","context of ebolavirus replication","various cell lines","virus replication rate","Mops condylurus","ebolavirus reservoir","potential correlation","potential influence","ebolavirus entry process","insectivorous microbat","potential reservoir host","fruit bats","non-human primates","European microbat species","different tissues","Ebola virus","cellular entry","different organs","humans","integral membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1","confocal microscopy","studies","evidence","ebolaviruses","flow cytometry","significance","qRT-PCR","order","infection experiments","aim"],"language":"en"},

The basis for high mortality among pregnant hepatitis E patients remains unclear. Importantly, a large proportion of infected pregnant women present with subclinical infection as well. In order to understand the possible mechanisms influencing clinical presentation of hepatitis E in pregnant women, we explored a system biology approach. For this, PBMCs from various categories were subjected to RNAseq analysis. These included non-pregnant (NPR, acute and convalescent phases) and pregnant (PR, 2(nd) and 3(rd) trimesters, acute phase and subclinical HEV infections) patients and corresponding healthy controls. The current study deals with immune response genes. In contrast to exclusive up-regulation of nonspecific, early immune response transcripts in the NPR patients, the PR patients exhibited broader and heightened expression of genes associated with innate as well as adaptive T and B cell responses. The study identified for the first time (1) inverse relationship of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes overexpression and (2) association of differential expression of S100 series genes with disease presentation. The data suggests possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggesting a role in protection. Induction of IFN\u03B3 gene was not detected during the acute phase irrespective of pregnancy. Association of response to vitamin D, transcripts related to NK/NKT and regulatory T cells during subclinical infection are noteworthy. The data obtained here could be correlated with several studies reported earlier in hepatitis E patients suggesting utility of PBMCs as an alternate specimen.

Recent studies revealed that a P. falciparum SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin (PfSWIB) might trigger stage-specific programmed cell death (PCD), and was not only crucial for the survival and development of parasite, but also had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins. However, it remains unclear whether PfSIWB is involved in transcriptional regulation of this virulence gene and its functional properties. METHODS: A conditional knockdown system \u201CPfSWIB-FKBP-LID\u201D was introduced to the parasite clone 3D7, and an integrated parasite line \u201CPfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID\u201D was obtained by drug cycling and clone screening. Growth curve analysis (GCA) was performed to investigate the growth and development of different parasite lines during 96 h in vitro culturing, by assessing parasitemia. Finally, we performed qPCR assays to detect var gene expression profiling in various comparison groups, as well as the mutually exclusive expression pattern of the var genes within a single 48 h life-cycle of P. falciparum in different parasite lines. In addition, RNA-seq was applied to analyze the var gene expression in different lines. RESULTS: GCA revealed that conditional knockdown of PfSWIB could interfere with the growth and development of P. falciparum. The parasitemia of PfSWIB\u2206 showed a significant decline at 96 h during in vitro culture compared with the PfSWIB and 3D7 lines (P \u003C 0.0001). qPCR and RNA-seq analysis confirmed that depletion of PfSWIB not only silences upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes, as well as removes the silencing of partial upsB var genes at the ring stage in PfSWIB\u2206 line, but also leads to aberrant expression of upsA and partial upsB/upsC var genes at the mature stage of P. falciparum, during a single 48-h life-cycle. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that PfSWIB was involved in the process of clonal variation in var gene expression, and crucial for the survival and development of Plasmodium parasite. These findings could provide better understanding of the mechanism and function of PfSWIB contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites.

Such patients are often admitted in a context of acute-on-chronic liver failure with extrahepatic failures. Sequential assessment of scores or classification based on organ failures within the first days after admission help to stratify the risk of mortality in this population. Although the prognosis of severely ill cirrhotic patients has recently improved, transplant-free mortality remains high. LT is still the only curative treatment in this population. Yet, the increased relative scarcity of graft resource must be considered alongside the increased risk of losing a graft in the initial postoperative period when performing LT in \u201Ctoo sick to transplant\u201D patients. Variables associated with poor immediate post-LT outcomes have been identified in large studies. Despite this, the performance of scores based on these variables is still insufficient. Consideration of a patient\u2019s comorbidities and frailty is an appealing predictive approach in this population that has proven of great value in many other diseases. So far, local expertise remains the last safeguard to LT. Using this expertise, data are accumulating on favourable post-LT outcomes in very high MELD populations, particularly when LT is performed in a situation of stabilization/improvement of organ failures in selected candidates. The absence of \u201Cdefinitive\u201D contraindications and the control of \u201Cdynamic\u201D contraindications allow a \u201Ctransplantation window\u201D to be defined. This window must be identified swiftly after admission given the poor short-term survival of patients with very high MELD scores.

Translational challenges include restoring hMSC efficacy following cryopreservation, developing effective xenogeneic-free (XF) hMSCs and establishing true therapeutic potential at a clinically relevant time point of administration. We wished to determine whether cytokine pre-activation of cryopreserved, bone marrow-derived XF-hMSCs would enhance their capacity to facilitate injury resolution following VILI and elucidate mechanisms of action. METHODS: Initially, in vitro studies examined the potential for the secretome from cytokine pre-activated XF-hMSCs to attenuate pulmonary epithelial injury induced by cyclic mechanical stretch. Later, anaesthetised rats underwent VILI and, 6 h following injury, were randomized to receive 1 \u00D7 10(7) XF-hMSC/kg that were (i) naive fresh, (ii) naive cryopreserved, (iii) cytokine pre-activated fresh or (iv) cytokine pre-activated cryopreserved, while control animals received (v) vehicle. The extent of injury resolution was measured at 24 h after injury. Finally, the role of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in mediating the effect of pre-activated XF-hMSCs was determined in a pulmonary epithelial wound repair model. RESULTS: Pre-activation enhanced the capacity of the XF-hMSC secretome to decrease stretch-induced pulmonary epithelial inflammation and injury. Both pre-activated fresh and cryopreserved XF-hMSCs enhanced resolution of injury following VILI, restoring oxygenation, improving lung compliance, reducing lung leak and improving resolution of lung structural injury. Finally, the secretome of pre-activated XF-hMSCs enhanced epithelial wound repair, in part via a KGF-dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine pre-activation enhanced the capacity of cryopreserved, XF-hMSCs to promote injury resolution following VILI, potentially via a KGF-dependent mechanism.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horie, Shahd; Gaynard, Sean; Murphy, Mary; Barry, Frank; Scully, Michael; O\u2019Toole, Daniel; Laffey, John G.","journal":"Intensive Care Med Exp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/229c14218c264e64c209ba8022c636d52fe8f279.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7002627.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7002627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytokine pre-activated XF-hMSCs","secretome of pre-activated XF-hMSCs","cryopreserved XF-hMSCs enhanced resolution of injury","effect of pre-activated XF-hMSCs","cytokine pre-activated cryopreserved","cytokine pre-activated fresh","pulmonary epithelial injury","cytokine pre-activation of cryopreserved","extent of injury resolution","VILI","XF-hMSC secretome","resolution of lung structural injury","ventilator-induced lung injury","bone marrow-derived XF-hMSCs","capacity of cryopreserved","pulmonary epithelial inflammation","lung leak","lung compliance","pulmonary epithelial wound repair model","KGF-dependent mechanism","restoring hMSC efficacy","true therapeutic potential","promising therapeutic strategy","cyclic mechanical stretch","cryopreservation","stromal cells","Human mesenchymal stem","effective xenogeneic-free","control animals","acute respiratory distress syndrome","relevant time point of administration","Translational challenges","BACKGROUND","role of keratinocyte growth factor","oxygenation","studies","mechanisms of action","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","anaesthetised rats","vehicle","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Early diagnosis of VAP is important to provide appropriate treatment and reduce mortality. Developing a noninvasive and highly accurate diagnostic method is important. The invention of electronic sensors has been applied to analyze the volatile organic compounds in breath to detect VAP using a machine learning technique. However, the process of building an algorithm is usually unclear and prevents physicians from applying the artificial intelligence technique in clinical practice. Clear processes of model building and assessing accuracy are warranted. The objective of this study was to develop a breath test for VAP with a standardized protocol for a machine learning technique. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study. This study enrolled subjects in an intensive care unit of a hospital in southern Taiwan from February 2017 to June 2019. We recruited patients with VAP as the case group and ventilated patients without pneumonia as the control group. We collected exhaled breath and analyzed the electric resistance changes of 32 sensor arrays of an electronic nose. We split the data into a set for training algorithms and a set for testing. We applied eight machine learning algorithms to build prediction models, improving model performance and providing an estimated diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 33 cases and 26 controls were used in the final analysis. Using eight machine learning algorithms, the mean accuracy in the testing set was 0.81 \u00B1 0.04, the sensitivity was 0.79 \u00B1 0.08, the specificity was 0.83 \u00B1 0.00, the positive predictive value was 0.85 \u00B1 0.02, the negative predictive value was 0.77 \u00B1 0.06, and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves was 0.85 \u00B1 0.04. The mean kappa value in the testing set was 0.62 \u00B1 0.08, which suggested good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: There was good accuracy in detecting VAP by sensor array and machine learning techniques.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are found in all classes of life ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. To identify AMPs, I. indigotica was explored using a novel, sensitive, and high-throughput Bacillus subtilis screening system. We found that IiR515 and IiR915 exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against a variety of bacterial (Xanthomonas oryzae, Ralstonia solanacearum, Clavibacter michiganensis, and C. fangii) and fungal (Phytophthora capsici and Botrytis cinerea) pathogens. Scanning electron microscope and cytometric analysis revealed the possible mechanism of these peptides, which was to target and disrupt the bacterial cell membrane. This model was also supported by membrane fluidity and electrical potential analyses.

Amongst all of the isolated LAB strains, five isolates identified as Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus salivarius, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, and Enterococcus faecium, were remarkably resistant to acid and bile salt. The probiotic characteristics (including adhesion capability, antimicrobial activities, autoaggregation, and coaggregation abilities), and safety properties (including hemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance, absence/presence of virulence factors, and in vivo safety) were evaluated. The results showed that all five isolates exhibited high adhesive potential, remarkable aggregation capacity, and antibacterial activities. Upon assessment of the safety, these strains were negative for hemolytic activity and all tested virulence genes. In vivo safety assessment showed no adverse effects of isolated strains supplementation on the body weight gain and organ indices of the treated mice.

Composting sites, biomethanization facilities, and dairy farms, all affected by the presence of fungi, were visited to collect air samples. The amplicon-based HTS approach is a target enrichment method that relies on the amplification of a specific target using particular primers before sequencing. Thus, the results are highly dependent on the quality of amplification. For this reason, the authors of this paper used a shotgun metagenomic approach to compare its outcome with the amplicon-based method. Indeed, shotgun metagenomic does not rely on any amplification prior to sequencing, because all genes are sequenced without a specific target. In addition, culture methods were added to the analyses in biomethanization and dairy farms samples to validate their contribution to fungal diversity of aerosols. The results obtained are unequivocal towards ITS1 outperformance to ITS2 in terms of richness, and taxonomic coverage. The differential abundance analysis did demonstrate that some taxa were exclusively detected only by ITS2, and vice-versa for ITS1. However, the shotgun metagenomic approach showed a taxonomic profile more resembling to ITS1 than ITS2. Based on these results, neither of the barcodes evaluated is perfect in terms of distinguishing all species. Using both barcodes offers a broader view of the fungal aerosol population. However, with the actual knowledge, the authors strongly recommend using ITS1 as a universal fungal barcode for quick general analyses of diversity and when limited financial resources are available, primarily due its ability to capture taxonomic profiles similar to those obtained using the shotgun metagenomic. The culture comparison with amplicon-based sequencing showed the complementarity of both approaches in describing the most abundant taxa.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mbareche, Hamza; Veillette, Marc; Bilodeau, Guillaume; Duchaine, Caroline","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bfc043d8a0d90892e9183f75dbe141a30fd68b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7032056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7032056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["amplicon-based sequencing","ITS2","amplicon-based method","shotgun metagenomic approach","amplicon-based HTS approach","ITS1 outperformance","results","fungal diversity of aerosols","aerosol samples","specific target","fungal aerosol population","dairy farms samples","universal fungal barcode","High-Throughput Sequencing","target enrichment method","taxonomic coverage","air samples","paper","quality of amplification","authors","barcodes","quick general analyses of diversity","taxonomic profiles similar","biomethanization facilities","terms of richness","culture comparison","culture methods","abundant taxa","eukaryotic genomic ribosomal regions","contribution","outcome","broader view","particular primers","ability","approaches","complementarity","genes","Composting sites","financial resources","vice-versa","differential abundance analysis","presence of fungi","actual knowledge","addition","species","reason"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to study the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (V(T)) on the distributions of regional ventilation and perfusion by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in healthy and injured lungs. METHODS: One-hit acute lung injury model was established in 6 piglets by repeated lung lavages (injured group). Four ventilated piglets served as the control group. A randomized sequence of any possible combination of three V(T) (7, 10, and 15 ml/kg) and four levels of PEEP (5, 8, 10, and 12 cmH(2)O) was performed in all animals. Ventilation and perfusion distributions were computed by EIT within three regions-of-interest (ROIs): nondependent, middle, dependent. A mixed design with one between-subjects factor (group: intervention or control), and two within-subjects factors (PEEP and V(T)) was used, with a three-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Two-way interactions between PEEP and group, and V(T) and group, were observed for the dependent ROI (p = 0.035 and 0.012, respectively), indicating that the increase in the dependent ROI ventilation was greater at higher PEEP and V(T) in the injured group than in the control group. A two-way interaction between PEEP and V(T) was observed for perfusion distribution in each ROI: nondependent (p = 0.030), middle (p = 0.006), and dependent (p = 0.001); no interaction was observed between injured and control groups.

METHODS: Retrospective, single-center, observational study at a specialized national weaning center in Germany. Patients\u2019 medical records were reviewed to obtain data on demographics, comorbidities, respiratory indices, and the result of a prospectively documented, standardized spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) upon admission to the weaning center. Respiratory indices assessed were the ventilatory ratio (VR) and parameters derived from calculated mechanical power (MP). Predictors associated with failure of prolonged weaning and failure of the SBT were assessed using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 263 prolonged mechanically ventilated, tracheotomized patients, treated over a 5-year period were analyzed. After 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation, patients with unsuccessful weaning failed a SBT more frequently and showed significantly increased values for inspiratory positive airway pressure, driving pressure, VR, absolute MP, and MP normalized to predicted body weight and dynamic lung-thorax compliance (LTC-MP). In the logistic regression analyses, variables independently correlated with weaning failure were female gender (adjusted odds ratio 0.532 [95% CI 0.291\u20130.973]; p = 0.040), obesity (body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m(2)) (2.595 [1.210\u20135.562]; p = 0.014), COPD (3.209 [1.563\u20136.589]; p = 0.002), LTC-MP (3.470 [1.067\u201311.284]; p = 0.039), P(a)CO(2) on mechanical ventilation (1.101 [95% CI 1.034\u20131.173]; p = 0.003), and failure of the SBT (4.702 [2.250\u20139.825]; p \u003C 0.001).

Current guidelines have not yet included standardization or guidance for diuretic-based de-resuscitation in critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a multi-disciplinary protocol for diuresis-guided de-resuscitation in the critically ill. METHODS: This was a pre-post single-center pilot study within the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a large academic medical center. Adult patients admitted to the Medical ICU receiving mechanical ventilation with either (1) clinical signs of volume overload via chest radiography or physical exam or (2) any cumulative fluid balance \u2265 0 mL since hospital admission were eligible for inclusion. Patients received diuresis per clinician discretion for a 2-year period (historical control) followed by a diuresis protocol for 1 year (intervention). Patients within the intervention group were matched in a 1:3 ratio with those from the historical cohort who met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 364 patients were included, 91 in the protocol group and 273 receiving standard care. Protocolized diuresis was associated with a significant decrease in 72-h post-shock cumulative fluid balance [median, IQR \u2212 2257 (\u2212 5676\u2013920) mL vs 265 (\u2212 2283\u20133025) mL; p \u003C 0.0001]. In-hospital mortality in the intervention group was lower compared to the historical group (5.5% vs 16.1%; p = 0.008) and higher ICU-free days (p = 0.03). However, no statistically significant difference was found in ventilator-free days, and increased rates of hypernatremia and hypokalemia were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a protocol for diuresis for de-resuscitation can significantly improve 72-h post-shock fluid balance with potential benefit on clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bissell, Brittany D.; Laine, Melanie E.; Thompson Bastin, Melissa L.; Flannery, Alexander H.; Kelly, Andrew; Riser, Jeremy; Neyra, Javier A.; Potter, Jordan; Morris, Peter E.","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d26bcc5678a883d9952f4e413201f5634c9be47.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7048112.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7048112/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Medical ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diuresis protocol","protocol group","ill patients","historical group","intervention group","h post-shock fluid balance","Medical ICU","study inclusion","de-resuscitation","Protocolized diuresis","Adult patients","h post-shock cumulative fluid balance","clinical outcomes","ill post-shock resolution","fluid management","higher ICU-free days","multi-disciplinary protocol","historical control","historical cohort","vs","medical intensive care unit","large academic medical center","pre-post single-center pilot study","ventilator-free days","clinical signs of volume overload","year period","hospital admission","significant decrease","standard care","hospital mortality","significant difference","potential benefit","chest radiography","physical exam","increased rates of hypernatremia","clinician discretion","standardization","guidance","impact","IQR","mechanical ventilation","hypokalemia","exclusion criteria","Administration of diuretics","OBJECTIVE","Current guidelines","METHODS","RESULTS","total","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Morphological analysis of spores by Scanning Electron Microscopy suggests that the main mechanism is plasma etching due to Reactive Oxygen Species or UV radiation. Spectroscopic analysis of plasma generated in humid air gives the hint that the rotational temperature of gas should not play a relevant role being very close to room temperature. In vivo experiments on artificially inoculated cherry fruits demonstrated that inactivation of fungal spores by the direct inhibitory effect of plasma extend their shelf life.

The advent of an alcohol-based product that can be used with or without water (ie, water optional) to decontaminate the hands while providing immediacy of kill and antimicrobial persistence could reduce the confusion associated with handwash guidelines. Such a product has been developed, is alcohol-based (61%), and zinc pyrithione (ZPT) preserved (61% alcohol-ZPT) and has proven to be fully compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC guidelines. Methods FDA-required testing of the 61% alcohol-ZPT product for the health care personnel handwash indication was performed as outlined in the Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products, employing waterless and water-aided product applications. It was next assessed for antimicrobial persistence and residual effects by comparing it, in separate waterless and water-aided applications, with commonly available handwashes containing various antimicrobials in a 5-day study employing 49 subjects, in which samples were collected immediately and at 4 hours and 8 hours postapplication. The skin conditioning properties of this formulation were investigated via appropriate methods. Results The 61% alcohol-ZPT product easily produced \u003E3.0 log10 reduction in the indicator strain (Serratia marcescens) following the first wash, exceeding the 2.0 log10 FDA requirement. This level of performance was maintained through the tenth wash, surpassing the 3.0 log10 FDA requirement for the handwash indication. For the assessment of persistence and residual effect in the waterless mode, the water-optional, 61% alcohol-ZPT product consistently produced log10 reductions of nearly 3.5 or greater at every point over the entire study period. In the water-aided configuration, similar results were obtained as log10 reductions of 2.5 were observed. The formulation is nonirritating, actually contributing to hand skin condition. Conclusions The 61% alcohol-ZPT product exceeds all FDA criteria for the health care personnel handwash indication and is a significant advancement in the concept of skin antisepsis. It represents a single product suitable for use in all hand hygiene settings, demonstrating improved antimicrobial persistence and residual effects. The 61% alcohol-ZPT formulation contributes positively to overall hand conditioning, and a previously reported study has documented it to be virucidal for several DNA and RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2005-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seal, Lawton A.; Rizer, Ronald L.; Maas-Irslinger, Rainer","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8121141696c2665f34295d13d6f18297ce0d8fa2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119045.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655305000933; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655305000933","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","CDC","Food and Drug Administration","FDA","Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alcohol-ZPT product","alcohol-ZPT formulation","alcohol-based product","waterless alcohol products","water-aided product applications","water optional","water-optional","handwash guidelines","water-aided applications","log10 FDA requirement","water-aided configuration","log10 reductions","Methods FDA","single product suitable","health care personnel handwash indication","handwash regimen","improved antimicrobial persistence","FDA criteria","hand skin condition","waterless mode","residual effects","assessment of persistence","CDC guidelines","hand hygiene settings","hand hygiene practices","overall hand conditioning","Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products","skin conditioning properties","day study","reported study","concept of skin antisepsis","entire study period","Drug Administration","similar results","hours postapplication","appropriate methods","TFM","significant advancement","nonantimicrobial soap","Prevention","available handwashes","various antimicrobials","Disease Control","Serratia","virucidal","point","indicator strain","Food","confusion","Tentative Final Monograph","DNA","RNA viruses","Centers","subjects","hands","immediacy","testing","advent","zinc pyrithione","Conclusions","level of performance","samples"],"language":"en"},

Although virus-induced G0/G1 arrest often delays early apoptosis temporarily, a prolonged replication of the infected virus leads host cells to eventual death. In contrast, most mammalian cells with RNA virus persistent infection often escape cytolysis in the presence of productive viral replication. In this study, we demonstrated that the extended endurance of cyclin D1 was clearly associated with the suppression of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u00DF (GSK-3\u00DF) expression in BHK-21 cells that are persistently infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The G0/G1 arrest of these cells turned much loose compared to the normal BHK-21 cells with JEV acute infection. After cycloheximide treatment, cyclin D1 in the persistently infected cells lasted several hours longer than those in acutely infected cells. Furthermore, both p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1), positive regulators for cyclin D1 accumulation in the nucleus, were suppressed in their expression, which contrasts with those in JEV acute infection. Inhibition of the GSK-3\u00DF by lithium chloride treatment rescued a significant number of cells from cytolysis in JEV acute infection, which coincided with the levels of cyclin D1 that escaped from proteolysis. Therefore, the limitation of G1/S arrest in the BHK-21 cells with JEV persistent infection is associated with the suppression of GSK-3\u00DF expression, resulting in the extended duration of cyclin D1.","publish_time":"2015-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ji Young; Park, Soo Young; Lyoo, Hey Rhyoung; Koo, Eung Seo; Kim, Man Su; Jeong, Yong Seok","journal":"J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38eeff2a52a1676f76abb3adc5b2dac1dc58011b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12275-015-4661-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25557483/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JEV","G1/S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected cells","host cells","mammalian cells","JEV acute infection","JEV persistent infection","infected virus","significant number of cells","cyclin D1 accumulation","levels of cyclin D1","RNA virus persistent infection","\u00DF expression","extended duration of cyclin D1","extended endurance of cyclin D1","G1 arrest","suppression of GSK","virus-induced G0","cytolysis","efficient replication","prolonged replication","Japanese encephalitis virus","S arrest","limitation of G1","normal BHK","RNA viruses","presence of productive viral replication","cycloheximide treatment","lithium chloride treatment","suppression of glycogen synthase kinase","cell cycle control","favorable cellular environments","positive regulators","early apoptosis","p27","Kip1","eventual death","nucleus","Cip1","evidence","contrast","hours","p21","Inhibition","proteolysis","study"],"language":"en"},

During infection, MERS-CoV regulates several host cellular processes including antiviral response genes. In order to determine if the nucleocapsid protein of MERS-CoV (MERS-N) plays a role in viral\u2013host interactions, a murine monoclonal antibody was generated so as to allow detection of the protein in infected cells as well as in overexpression system. Then, MERS-N was stably overexpressed in A549 cells, and a PCR array containing 84 genes was used to screen for genes transcriptionally regulated by it. Several up-regulated antiviral genes, namely TNF, IL6, IL8, and CXCL10, were selected for independent validation in transiently transfected 293FT cells. Out of these, the overexpression of MERS-N was found to up-regulate CXCL10 at both transcriptional and translational levels. Interestingly, CXCL10 has been reported to be up-regulated in MERS-CoV infected airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblast cells, as well as monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. High secretions and persistent increase of CXCL10 in MERS-CoV patients have been also associated with severity of disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that the MERS-N protein is one of the contributing factors for CXCL10 up-regulation during infection. In addition, our results showed that a fragment consisting of residues 196\u2013413 in MERS-N is sufficient to up-regulate CXCL10, while the N-terminal domain and serine-arginine (SR)-rich motif of MERS-N do not play a role in this up-regulation.","publish_time":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aboagye, James Odame; Yew, Chow Wenn; Ng, Oi-Wing; Monteil, Vanessa M.; Mirazimi, Ali; Tan, Yee-Joo","journal":"Biosci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d941db9f06f446ae113c5f76f7597553a2f365b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6200698.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20181059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30242057/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-N protein","overexpression of MERS","MERS-CoV patients","nucleocapsid protein of MERS","MERS-CoV infected airway epithelial cells","rich motif of MERS","infected cells","dendritic cells","A549 cells","FT cells","N-terminal domain","antiviral genes","lung fibroblast cells","persistent increase of CXCL10","antiviral response genes","role","regulation","infection","host interactions","respiratory diseases","High secretions","overexpression system","host cellular processes","high mortality rate","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","SR","humans","serine-arginine","IL6","monocyte-derived macrophages","murine monoclonal antibody","contributing factors","TNF","PCR array","independent validation","translational levels","IL8","detection","report","results","fragment","order","residues","severity of disease","addition","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are major innate leukocytes that orchestrate protective immunity to viral lung infections. However, a dysregulated cytokine response can promote excessive infiltration and robust pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages, leading to fatal disease. Following virus infection, the beneficial or deleterious role of infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages is determined largely by their ability to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A majority of studies use the total number of infiltrating cells and their activation status as measures to demonstrate their role during an infection. Consequently, the ability of neutrophils and Inflammatory Monocyte Macrophages (IMMs) to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and its correlation with the disease severity, is not well defined. In this chapter, we report useful markers to identify lung infiltrating innate immune cells and define their activation status. We also describe a simple method to measure intracellular cytokine production to evaluate the inflammatory activity of neutrophils and IMMs in a mouse model of human coronavirus infection.","publish_time":"2019-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"MERS Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5dde1a2a4014c9d44a6ad4c59a9606c9040e8ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123665.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-0211-9_15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31883097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Inflammatory Monocyte Macrophages","monocyte-macrophages","ability of neutrophils","inflammatory cytokines","deleterious role of infiltrating neutrophils","Innate immune cells","robust pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils","Myeloid cells","total number of infiltrating cells","IMMs","vital role","activation status","chemokines","major innate leukocytes","dysregulated cytokine response","disease severity","fatal disease","mouse model of human coronavirus infection","effective host response","intracellular cytokine production","viral lung infections","excessive infiltration","protective immunity","useful markers","variety of pathogen challenges","simple method","correlation","majority of studies","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Inverse design concept uses the desired enclosed environment as the design objective and inversely determines the systems required to achieve the objective. This paper discusses a number of backward and forward methods for inverse design. Backward methods, such as the quasi-reversibility method, pseudo-reversibility method, and regularized inverse matrix method, can be used to identify contaminant sources in an enclosed environment. However, these methods cannot be used to inversely design a desired indoor environment. Forward methods, such as the CFD-based adjoint method, CFD-based genetic algorithm method, and proper orthogonal decomposition method, show the promise in the inverse design of airflow and heat transfer in an enclosed environment. The CFD-based adjoint method is accurate and can handle many design parameters without increasing computing costs, but the method may find a locally optimal design that could meet the design objective with constrains. The CFD-based genetic algorithm method, on the other hand, can provide the global optimal design that can meet the design objective without constraints, but the computing cost can increase dramatically with the number of design parameters. The proper orthogonal decomposition method is a reduced-order method that can significantly lower computing costs, but at the expense of reduced accuracy. This paper also discusses the possibility to reduce the computing costs of CFD-based design methods.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wei; Zhang, Tengfei; Xue, Yu; Zhai, Zhiqiang; Wang, Jihong; Wei, Yun; Chen, Qingyan","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/061892d4a7da839f651e6d68cabf24f73c6a80bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127361.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132315001183; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132315001183; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.02.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["design objective","based design methods","inverse design of airflow","Inverse design concept","number of design parameters","CFD-based adjoint method","global optimal design","genetic algorithm method","conventional design of enclosed environments","pseudo-reversibility method","quasi-reversibility method","reduced-order method","proper orthogonal decomposition method","regularized inverse matrix method","computing costs of CFD","Backward methods","forward methods","desired enclosed environment","lower computing costs","desired indoor environment","number of backward","paper","expense of reduced accuracy","heat transfer","promise","trial","error approach","hand","constraints","time consuming","contaminant sources","possibility","systems"],"language":"en"},

The viruses were isolated using a cross-neutralization test and limiting dilution in embryonated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) eggs. Isolate LDL/150434\u2013I was a re-isolation of H120 vaccine strain that was introduced into the chicken flock by vaccination, transmitted between chickens, and later accumulated several genomic mutations. Isolate LDL/150434\u2013II was a novel variant that originated from recombination events between H120 and ck/CH/LDT3/03-like viruses. The widespread use of H120 vaccine, which offered incomplete protection against heterotypic IBVs in the fields, may play important roles in the emergence of such a novel genetic variant. Based on the analysis of S1 and complete genomic sequence, isolate LDL/150434\u2013III was related genetically but distinct from the established strains of nrTW I type viruses of GI-7 lineage circulating in Mainland China since 2009. The three IBV isolates were avirulent when they infected SPF chickens. Furthermore, synergistic effects on pathogenicity were not observed when the different types co-infected the SPF chickens. However, the isolates persisted in the respiratory tracts longer in combined infected birds than those in individual infected birds.

The emerging concerns of the new century \u2013 genomics, globalization, the built environment, information technology, global warming, emerging infections, violence, and so forth \u2013 will require not only the traditional disciplines but also new expertise and new global partners, both public and private.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thacker, S.

The goal of this study was to identify genetic features unique to KM22 by comparing the genome sequence of KM22 to the laboratory reference strain RB50. To gain a broader perspective of the genetic relationship of KM22 among other B. bronchiseptica strains, selected genes of KM22 were then compared to five other B. bronchiseptica strains isolated from different hosts. Overall, the KM22 genome sequence is more similar to the genome sequences of the strains isolated from animals than the strains isolated from humans. The majority of virulence gene expression in Bordetella is positively regulated by the two-component sensory transduction system BvgAS. bopN, bvgA, fimB, and fimC were the most highly conserved BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains analyzed. In contrast, the BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains with the highest sequence divergence werefimN, fim2, fhaL, andfhaS. A total of eight major fimbrial subunit genes were identified in KM22. Quantitative real-time PCR data demonstrated that seven of the eight fimbrial subunit genes identified in KM22 are expressed and regulated by BvgAS. The annotation of the KM22 genome sequence, coupled with the comparative genomic analyses reported in this study, can be used to facilitate the development of vaccines with improved efficacy towards B. bronchiseptica in swine to decrease the prevalence and disease burden caused by this pathogen.","publish_time":"2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicholson, Tracy L.; Shore, Sarah M.; Register, Karen B.; Bayles, Darrell O.; Kingsley, Robert A.; Brunelle, Brian W.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bf6de18aec2c9d092d17543fba178914aca2cfa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117204.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515300675; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515300675; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.10.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26711033/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome sequence of KM22","KM22 genome sequence","bronchiseptica strains","selected genes of KM22","genetic relationship of KM22","conserved BvgAS-regulated genes present","well-characterized Bordetella bronchiseptica strain KM22","major fimbrial subunit genes","genome sequences","study","highest sequence divergence werefimN","component sensory transduction system BvgAS","disease burden","reproducible swine respiratory disease model","genetic features unique","laboratory reference strain RB50","fim2","fhaL","improved efficacy","majority of virulence gene expression","fimC","comparative genomic analyses","prevalence","total","animals","development of vaccines","broader perspective","Quantitative real-time PCR data","andfhaS","pig","different hosts","contrast","annotation","atrophic rhinitis","bopN","pathogen","humans","goal"],"language":"en"},

Several full genomic sequences of this virus have been released for the study of its evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics2, 3, 4. Here, we analyzed the potential mutations that may have evolved after the virus became epidemic among humans and also the mutations resulting in the human adaptation. The sequences of BetaCoV were downloaded on February 3, 2020 from the GISAID platform5. A total of 58 accessions were available, among which BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 is a known close relative of SARS-CoV-2. Four accessions, namely, BetaCov/Italy/INM1/2020, BetaCov/Italy/INM2/2020, BetaCoV/Kanagawa/1/2020, and BetaCoV/USA/IL1/2020, were excluded because of the short-truncated sequences or multiple ambiguous nucleotides. A total of 54 accessions (Supplementary table 1) isolated from humans were utilized in the following analysis. The sequences NC_004718.3 of SARS coronavirus6 genes were utilized to define the protein products of SARS-CoV-2. The protein sequences of ORF1ab, S, E, M, and N genes were translated, and all of the loci without experimental evidences were excluded. First, the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were compared with RaTG13, human SARS (NC_004718.3), bat SARS (DQ022305.2), and human MERS (NC_019843.3) by calculating the similarity in a given sliding window (Figure 1A). The sliding window was set to 500 for ORF1ab and S, and to 50 for proteins E, M, and N considering their short length. SARS-CoV-2 were highly similar to RaTG13 isolated from bats, showing 96% identity based on the whole-nucleotide sequences and 83% based on the protein sequences, suggesting a bat zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2. ORF1a, and the head of S seemed to have diverged from other beta coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Feng; Yu, Hai; Guo, Jinyue; Li, Yong; Luo, Kaijian; Huang, Shujian","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9734aee4d4b23514f212925f9ed294a30132d3dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126159.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301080; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320301080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145215/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC","SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","protein sequences of SARS","bat SARS","human SARS","novel SARS","sequences of BetaCoV","protein products of SARS","sequences NC","SARS coronavirus6 genes","SARS-related CoV1","bat zoonotic origin of SARS","protein sequences of ORF1ab","nucleotide sequences","genomic sequences","known close relative of SARS","short-truncated sequences","RaTG13","total","accessions","Italy","humans","N genes","head of S","human adaptation","human MERS","China","given sliding window","evolutionary origin","proteins E","recent study","short length","potential mutations","genetic recombination","multiple ambiguous nucleotides","journal","genomes","Supplementary table","people","INM2","INM1","confirmed cases of COVID","molecular characteristics2","deaths","bats","similarity","Figure","Kanagawa","Yunnan","DQ022305","loci","experimental evidences","Chinese CDC","identity","following analysis","USA","IL1","beta coronaviruses","GISAID platform5"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Respiratory specimens collected within the national surveillance system were tested for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and human metapneumovirus. Overall and virus-specific positive detection rate (PDR) were calculated and compared the timing of epidemics caused by the different viruses. Logistic regression models were used to compare the age distribution and risk of death across respiratory viruses. RESULTS: A total of 41,172 specimens were analyzed: influenza (PDR = 14.3%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (PDR = 9.5%) were the most frequently detected viruses. Influenza epidemics typically peaked in December\u2013January and RSV epidemics in March; seasonality was less evident for the other viruses. Compared to adults, children were more frequently infected with RSV, adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza B, while the elderly were less frequently infected with influenza A(H1N1)p. The age-adjusted risk of death was highest for A(H1N1)p (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.38\u20132.17), and lowest for RSV (OR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57\u20130.98). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst influenza and RSV were the most frequently detected pathogens, the risk of death differed by RVI, being highest for pandemic influenza and lowest for RSV.","publish_time":"2018-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caini, Saverio; de Mora, Dom\u00E9nica; Olmedo, Maritza; Portugal, Denisses; Becerra, Mar\u00EDa A.; Mej\u00EDa, Marcela; Pacurucu, Mar\u00EDa C.; Ojeda, Jenny; Bonaccorsi, Guglielmo; Lorini, Chiara; Paget, John; Bruno, Alfredo","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44a6d9803cc72c8540c1f68d321835191c44c54f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102740.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034118303204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573330/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2018.12.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034118303204","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","respiratory viruses","RSV epidemics","Influenza epidemics","pandemic influenza","influenza B","respiratory syncytial virus","Respiratory specimens","detected viruses","parainfluenza virus","PDR","different viruses","Respiratory viral infections","age-adjusted risk of death","adenovirus","H1N1","severity of RVI","timing of epidemics","virus-specific positive detection rate","age distribution","detected pathogens","national surveillance system","BACKGROUND","elderly","odds ratio","human metapneumovirus","leading cause of mortality","epidemiology","Ecuador","children","seasonality","confidence intervals","Logistic regression models","RESULTS","total","adults","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Recombination frequencies between different is mutants increased steadily during infection and peaked late in the virus growth cycle. These data suggest that recombination is a late event in the virus replication cycle. Recombination frequencies were also found to range from 63 to 20,000 times higher than the sum of the spontaneous reversion frequencies of each is mutant used in the cross. Utilizing standard genetic recombination techniques, the five RNA\u2212 complementation groups of MHV-A59 were arranged into an additive, linear, genetic map located at the 5\u2032 end of the genome in the 23-kb polymerase region. These data indicate that at least five distinct functions are encoded in the MHV polymerase region which function in virus transcription. Moreover, using well-characterized is mutants the recombination frequency for the entire 32-kb MHV genome was found to approach 25% or more.

We investigated the physiological origins of this clinical observation linking diabetes with severity and adverse outcome of COVID-19. METHODS: Publication mining was applied to reveal common physiological contexts in which diabetes and COVID-19 have been investigated simultaneously. Overall, we have acquired 1,121,078 publications from PubMed in the time span between 01 and 01-2000 and 17-04-2020, and extracted knowledge graphs interconnecting the topics related to diabetes and COVID-19. RESULTS: The Data Mining revealed three pathophysiological pathways linking diabetes and COVID-19. The first pathway indicates a higher risk for COVID-19 because of an upregulation of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The other two important physiological links between diabetes and COVID-19 are liver dysfunction and chronic systemic inflammation. A deep network analysis has suggested clinical biomarkers predicting the higher risk: Hypertension, elevated serum Alanine aminotransferase, high Interleukin-6, and low Lymphocytes count. CONCLUSIONS: The revealed biomarkers can be applied directly in clinical practice. For newly infected patients, the medical history needs to be checked for evidence of a long-term, chronic dysregulation of these biomarkers. In particular, patients with diabetes, but also those with prediabetic state, deserve special attention.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marhl, Marko; Grubelnik, Vladimir; Magdi\u010D, Mar\u0161a; Markovi\u010D, Rene","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb7024ea7465ef5b2126e23bead8821035dcc756.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d5f33fd66c490e505ad1557256826a90527604d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205616.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301326?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438331/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120301326; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Data Mining"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diabetes","clinical biomarkers","higher risk","Clinical evidence","adverse outcome of COVID","clinical observation","clinical practice","revealed biomarkers","physiological origins","infected patients","common physiological contexts","important physiological links","Data Mining","Publication mining","chronic dysregulation","chronic systemic inflammation","elevated serum Alanine aminotransferase","Hypertension","high Interleukin","severity","liver dysfunction","pathophysiological pathways","Coronavirus disease","deep network analysis","AIMS","topics","prediabetic state","medical history","publications","PubMed","time span","special attention","low Lymphocytes count","BACKGROUND","upregulation of Angiotensin","knowledge graphs","enzyme","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

This is due to the vulnerability of health and economic systems, coupled with the high burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. Here we examine the potential implications of COVID-19 on the control of these major epidemic diseases in Africa. We use current evidence on disease burden of HIV, TB, and malaria, and epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Africa, retrieved from the literature. Our analysis shows that the current measures to control COVID-19 neglect important and complex context-specific epidemiological, social, and economic realities in Africa. There is a similarity of clinical features of TB and malaria, with those used to track COVID-19 cases. This coupled with institutional mistrust and misinformation might result in many patients with clinical features similar to those of COVID-19 being hesitant to voluntarily seek care in a formal health facility. Furthermore, most people in productive age in Africa work in the informal sector, and most of those in the formal sector are underemployed. With the current measures to control COVID-19, these populations might face unprecedented difficulties to access essential services, mainly due to reduced ability of patients to support direct and indirect medical costs, and unavailability of transportation means to reach health facilities. Therefore, if not accompanied with appropriate economic and epidemiological considerations, we anticipate that these measures might result in unprecedented difficulties among vulnerable segments of society to access essential services, including antiretroviral and prophylactic drugs among people living with HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, anti-tuberculosis drugs, and curative and preventive treatments for malaria among pregnant women and children. This might increase the propensity of patients taking substandard doses and/or medicines, which has the potential to compromise drug efficacy, and worsen health inequalities in the region. COVID-19 responses at country level should include measures to protect vulnerable and under-served segments of society.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amimo, Floriano; Lambert, Ben; Magit, Anthony","journal":"Trop Med Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c4c862941dc8c85c4fd9f7599b3d002dbb0d2cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7218555.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-020-00219-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["malaria","current measures","potential implications of COVID","epidemic dynamics of COVID","Africa work","control","health inequalities","current evidence","vulnerability of health","health facilities","disease burden of HIV","formal health facility","essential services","vulnerable segments of society","people","unprecedented difficulties","economic systems","economic realities","propensity of patients","similarity of clinical features of TB","anti-tuberculosis drugs","reduced ability of patients","clinical features similar","prophylactic drugs","epidemiological considerations","coronavirus disease","informal sector","major epidemic diseases","complex context-specific epidemiological","low global share of cases","high burden of human immunodeficiency virus","preventive treatments","Immune Deficiency Syndrome","deaths","neglect important","indirect medical costs","unavailability of transportation","pregnant women","regions","productive age","country level","substandard doses","care","drug efficacy","responses","misinformation","medicines","children","larger crises","populations","institutional mistrust","analysis","literature"],"language":"en"},

However, the role of endogenous IL-33 in viral hepatitis remains obscure. We aimed to decipher its function by infecting IL-33-deficient mice (IL-33 KO) and their wild-type (WT) littermates with pathogenic mouse hepatitis virus (L2-MHV3). The IL-33 KO mice were more sensitive to L2-MHV3 infection exhibiting higher levels of AST/ALT, higher tissue damage, significant weight loss, and earlier death. An increased depletion of B and T lymphocytes, NKT cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages was observed 48 h postinfection (PI) in IL-33 KO mice than that in WT mice. In contrast, a massive influx of neutrophils was observed in IL-33 KO mice at 48 h PI. A transcriptomic study of inflammatory and cell-signaling genes revealed the overexpression of IL-6, TNF\u03B1, and several chemokines involved in recruitment/activation of neutrophils (CXCL2, CXCL5, CCL2, and CCL6) at 72 h PI in IL-33 KO mice. However, the IFN\u03B3 was strongly induced in WT mice with less profound expression in IL-33 KO mice demonstrating that endogenous IL-33 regulated IFN\u03B3 expression during L2-MHV3 hepatitis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that endogenous IL-33 had multifaceted immunoregulatory effect during viral hepatitis via induction of IFN\u03B3, survival effect on immune cells, and infiltration of neutrophils in the liver.","publish_time":"2017-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carri\u00E8re, Virginie; Arshad, Muhammad Imran; Le Seyec, Jacques; Lefevre, Benjamin; Farooq, Muhammad; Jan, Aur\u00E9lien; Manuel, Christelle; Touami-Bernard, Laurence; Lucas-Clerc, Catherine; Genet, Valentine; Gascan, Hugues; Girard, Jean-Philippe; Chalmel, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Lamontagne, Lucie; Piquet-Pellorce, Claire; Samson, Michel","journal":"Mediators Inflamm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb61dcfd20c7d56e90a52779d3f51a1f68c46362.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5457781.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/1359064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28607531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":["AST/ALT","PI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KO mice","overexpression of IL","infecting IL","alarmin IL","WT mice","role of endogenous IL","deficient mice","L2-MHV3 hepatitis","murine viral hepatitis","h PI","L2-MHV3 infection","dendritic cells","NKT cells","immune cells","induction of IFN\u03B3","pathogenic mouse hepatitis virus","regulated IFN\u03B3 expression","activation of neutrophils","infiltration of neutrophils","h postinfection","massive influx of neutrophils","survival effect","profound expression","higher levels of AST","higher tissue damage","multifaceted immunoregulatory effect","T lymphocytes","significant weight loss","ALT","littermates","CXCL2","CXCL5","macrophages","increased depletion of B","wild-type","earlier death","recruitment","CCL2","genes","CCL6","transcriptomic study of inflammatory","chemokines","contrast","TNF\u03B1","human","liver","function","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to determine the reliability of a combination of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS), Internal Medicine in-Training Examination (IM-ITE\u00AE) and OSCE, and to verify the correlation between the small-scale OSCE\u002BDOPS\u002BIM-ITE\u00AE-composited scores and 360-degree evaluation scores of first year post-graduate (PGY1) residents. Methods Between 2007 January to 2010 January, two hundred and nine internal medicine PGY1 residents completed DOPS, IM-ITE\u00AE and small-scale OSCE at our hospital.

Moreover, A9 exhibited potent antiviral activity against the replication of various CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). We further performed a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis to investigate the mechanism of action of A9 against TGEV infection in vitro. We specifically identified p38 and JNK1, which are the downstream molecules of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) required for efficient TGEV replication, as A9 targets through plaque assays, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays. p38 and JNK1 inhibitors and RNA interference further showed that the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV infection was mainly mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. All these findings indicated that the RTKI A9 directly inhibits TGEV replication and that its inhibitory activity against TGEV replication mainly occurs by targeting p38, which provides vital clues to the design of novel drugs against CoVs.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dong, Wanyu; Xie, Wenting; Liu, Yunbo; Sui, Baokun; Zhang, Hao; Liu, Liran; Tan, Yubei; Tong, Xiaohan; Fu, Zhen F.; Yin, Ping; Fang, Liurong; Peng, Guiqing","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44ce728e9777a6644404a15f6945116b189f3c17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114126.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354219302347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31751591/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104651; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354219302347","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","RTKI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV infection","RTKI A9","efficient TGEV replication","inhibitory activity of A9","A9 targets","replication of various CoVs","murine hepatitis virus","receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor","plaque assays","robust inhibitor of transmissible gastroenteritis virus","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","feline infectious peritonitis virus","potent antiviral activity","Western blotting assays","cell-based assays","JNK1 inhibitors","downstream molecules of receptor tyrosine kinases","PEDV","MHV","qRT-PCR","RTKs","humans","severe gastroenteric","RNA interference","mechanism of action","animals","respiratory diseases","MAPK","design of novel drugs","vital clues","FIPV","approved therapeutics","comparative phosphoproteomic analysis","Abstract Emerging coronaviruses","pathway","tyrphostin class","findings"],"language":"en"},

Subgroup analysis suggests these changes occur predominantly in patients with exacerbation of airways disease. Use of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses is becoming widespread but there is a lack of evidence to inform the choice between multiplex syndromic panels versus POCT for influenza only. Materials/methods We evaluated patients from the ResPOC study with exacerbation of asthma or COPD who were treated with antibiotics. The duration of antibiotics and proportion with early discontinuation were compared between patients testing positive and negative for viruses by POCT, and controls. Patients testing positive for viruses by POCT were compared according to virus types. Results 118 patient with exacerbation of airways disease received antibiotics in the POCT group and 111 in the control group. In the POCT group 49/118 (42%) patients tested positive for viruses. Of those testing positive for viruses 17/49 (35%) had early discontinuation of antibiotics versus 9/69 (13%) testing negative and 7/111 (6%) of controls, p\u003C0.0001. Of those positive for viruses by POCT 10/49 (20%) were positive for influenza, 21/49 (43%) for rhinovirus and 18/49 (37%) for other viruses. The proportion with early discontinuation of antibiotics was not different between the virus types (p = 0.34).

To date, several viral vectors have been utilized for the generation of vaccines. Among them, baculovirus\u2014categorized as a nonhuman viral vector\u2014has been used in wider applications. Its versatile features, like large cloning capacity, nonreplicative nature in mammalian cells, and broad tissue tropism, hold it at an excellent position among vaccine vectors. In addition to ease and safety during swift production, recent key improvements to existing baculovirus vectors (such as inclusion of hybrid promoters, immunostimulatory elements, etc.) have led to significant improvements in immunogenicity and efficacy of surface-displayed antigens. Furthermore, some promising preclinical results have been reported that mirror the scope and practicality of baculovirus as a vaccine vector for human applications in the near future. Herein, this review provides an overview of the induced immune responses by baculovirus surface-displayed vaccines against influenza and other infectious diseases in animal models, and highlights the strategies applied to enhance the protective immune responses against the displayed antigens.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Premanand, Balraj; Zhong Wee, Poh; Prabakaran, Mookkan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f3e46abb51fffc3d562bd26117eed795c3febe6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6024371.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v10060298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29857561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["baculovirus surface","existing baculovirus vectors","practicality of baculovirus","vaccine vectors","viral vectors","displayed antigens","infectious diseases","induced immune responses","protective immune responses","nonhuman viral vector","efficacy of surface","significant improvements","human applications","generation of vaccines","wider applications","recent key improvements","mammalian cells","large cloning capacity","swift production","nonreplicative nature","safety","influenza","inclusion of hybrid promoters","occurrence","broad tissue tropism","animal models","immunostimulatory elements","versatile features","strategies","immunogenicity","overview","near future","excellent position","efficient way","addition","humans","promising preclinical results","Vaccination","review","scope"],"language":"en"},

To understand the effect of transport-related infection on disease spread, an SEIRS (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) epidemic model for two cities is formulated and analyzed. The epidemiological threshold, known as the basic reproduction number, of the model is derived. If the basic reproduction number is below unity, the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. Thus, the disease can be eradicated from the community. There exists an endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable if the reproduction number is larger than unity. This means that the disease will persist within the community. The results show that transportation among regions will change the disease dynamics and break infection out even if infectious diseases will go to extinction in each isolated region without transport-related infection. In addition, the result shows that transport-related infection intensifies the disease spread if infectious diseases break out to cause an endemic situation in each region, in the sense of that both the absolute and relative size of patients increase. Further, the formulated model is applied to the real data of SARS outbreak in 2003 to study the transmission of disease during the movement between two regions. The results show that the transport-related infection is effected to the number of infected individuals and the duration of outbreak in such the way that the disease becomes more endemic due to the movement between two cities.

Since SARS showed a severe case fatality ratio, our concern is to know such a case fatality ratio as soon as possible after a similar outbreak begins. The epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS can be dealt with as the probabilistic growth curve models, and the parameter estimation procedure for the probabilistic growth curve models may similarly be treated as the lifetime analysis. Thus, we try to do the parameter estimation to the SARS cases for the infected cases, fatal cases, and cured cases here, as we usually do it in the lifetime analysis. Using the truncated data models to the infected and fatal cases with some censoring time, we may estimate the total (or final) numbers of the patients and deaths, and the case fatality ratio may be estimated by these two numbers. We may also estimate the case fatality ratio using the numbers of the patients and recoveries, but this estimate differs from that using the numbers of the patients and deaths, especially when the censoring time is located at early stages. To circumvent this inconsistency, we propose a mixed trunsored model, an extension of the trunsored model, which can use the data of the patients, deaths, and recoveries simultaneously. The estimate of the case fatality ratio and its confidence interval are easily obtained in a numerical sense. This paper mainly treats the case in Hong Kong. The estimated epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS, fitted to the infected, fatal, and cured cases in Hong Kong, could be the logistic distribution function among the logistic, log-normal, gamma, and Weibull models. Using the proposed method, it would be appropriate that the SARS case fatality ratio is roughly estimated to be 17% in Hong Kong. Worldwide, it is roughly estimated to be about 12\u201318%, if we consider the safety side without the Chinese case. Unlike the questionably small confidence intervals for the case fatality ratio using the truncated models, the case fatality ratio in the proposed model provides a reasonable confidence interval.","publish_time":"2007-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hirose, Hideo","journal":"Mathematics and Computers in Simulation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26552203057c609bf1926fb9890da2457f54fc5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125585.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378475406002151; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475406002151; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matcom.2006.06.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288112/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS case fatality ratio","severe case fatality ratio","SARS cases","Chinese case","fatal cases","truncated models","cured cases","infected cases","truncated data models","proposed model","mixed trunsored model","patients","numbers","unified model","Weibull models","probabilistic growth curve models","fatal mixed populations","deaths","Hong Kong","lifetime analysis","new incomplete data model","estimated epidemiological determinants","reasonable confidence interval","censoring time","recoveries","parameter estimation procedure","small confidence intervals","durable populations","fragile population","proposed method","logistic distribution function","log-normal","gamma","extension","concern","prescribed value","similar outbreak","ease","early stages","total","hypothesis","safety","inconsistency","paper","numerical sense"],"language":"en"},

During initial infection, within-host HA diversity increased drastically. Then, airborne transmission fixed 2 polymerase mutations that do not confer a detectable replication advantage. In later transmissions, selection fixed advantageous HA1 variants. Transmission initially involved a \u201Cloose\u201D bottleneck, which became strongly selective after additional HA mutations emerged. The stringency and evolutionary forces governing between-host bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. Mutations occurred in multiple combinations in transmitted viruses, suggesting that mammalian transmissibility can evolve through multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic constraints.

Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (\u03B3), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.

The disease presents multi-systemic clinical signs (respiratory, renal, enteric, and reproductive) and is caused by one coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV). Infectious bronchitis virus is classified into different serotypes and genotypes (vaccine strains and field variants). This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of IBV in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions in Brazil and to determine the tropism of the main circulating genotypes to 3 different avian physiological systems (respiratory, digestive, urinary/reproductive). Clinical samples with suggestive signs of IBV infection were collected from 432 different poultry commercial flocks (198 from broilers and 234 from breeders). The total number of biological samples consisted of organ pools from the 3 above physiological systems obtained of farms from 3 important producing regions: midwest, northeast, and south. Infectious bronchitis virus was detected by reverse-transcription, real-time PCR of the 5\u2032 untranslated region. The results showed 179 IBV-positive flocks (41.4% of the flocks), with 107 (24.8%) from broilers and 72 (16.8%) from breeders. There were similar frequencies of IBV-positive flocks in farms from different regions of the country, most often in broilers (average 54%) compared with breeders (average 30.8%). reverse-transcription was more frequently detected in the digestive system of breeders (40%), and in the digestive (43.5%) and respiratory (37.7%) systems of broilers. Infectious bronchitis virus genotyping was performed by a reverse-transcription nested PCR and sequencing of the S1 gene from a selection of 79 IBV-positive flocks (45 from broilers and 34 from breeders). The majority of the flocks were infected with Brazilian variant genotype than with Massachusetts vaccine genotype. These results demonstrate the predominance of the Brazilian variant (mainly in the enteric tract) in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions in Brazil.","publish_time":"2014-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balestrin, Eder; Fraga, Aline P.; Ikuta, Nilo; Canal, Cl\u00E1udio W.; Fonseca, Andr\u00E9 S.K.; Lunge, Vagner R.","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16497fd9524979c594eee37ef343da2a871cd2d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107171.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119384627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894532/; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps.2014-03875; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119384627","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Brazil","Massachusetts"],"keyphrases":["IBV-positive flocks","commercial poultry flocks","different poultry commercial flocks","different regions","systems of broilers","Infectious bronchitis virus genotyping","occurrence of IBV","important producing regions","Abstract Avian infectious bronchitis","digestive system of breeders","different avian physiological systems","similar frequencies of IBV","different serotypes","poultry agribusiness","suggestive signs of IBV infection","reverse-transcription nested PCR","farms","Clinical samples","Brazilian variant genotype","results","average","Massachusetts vaccine genotype","vaccine strains","multi-systemic clinical signs","real-time PCR","enteric tract","contagious viral disease","main circulating genotypes","total number of biological samples","economic effects","sequencing","S1 gene","organ pools","selection","field variants","tropism","midwest","northeast","country","coronavirus","predominance","untranslated region","study","majority"],"language":"en"},

However, messaging has been inconsistent and unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine COVID-19 awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and related behaviors among U.S. adults who are more vulnerable to complications of infection because of age and comorbid conditions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey linked to 3 active clinical trials and 1 cohort study. SETTING: 5 academic internal medicine practices and 2 federally qualified health centers. PATIENTS: 630 adults aged 23 to 88 years living with 1 or more chronic conditions. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to COVID-19. RESULTS: A fourth (24.6%) of participants were \u201Cvery worried\u201D about getting the coronavirus. Nearly a third could not correctly identify symptoms (28.3%) or ways to prevent infection (30.2%). One in 4 adults (24.6%) believed that they were \u201Cnot at all likely\u201D to get the virus, and 21.9% reported that COVID-19 had little or no effect on their daily routine. One in 10 respondents was very confident that the federal government could prevent a nationwide outbreak. In multivariable analyses, participants who were black, were living below the poverty level, and had low health literacy were more likely to be less worried about COVID-19, to not believe that they would become infected, and to feel less prepared for an outbreak. Those with low health literacy had greater confidence in the federal government response. LIMITATION: Cross-sectional study of adults with underlying health conditions in 1 city during the initial week of the COVID-19 U.S. outbreak. CONCLUSION: Many adults with comorbid conditions lacked critical knowledge about COVID-19 and, despite concern, were not changing routines or plans. Noted disparities suggest that greater public health efforts may be needed to mobilize the most vulnerable communities.

The technologies used in the fabrication of both thick- and thin-film electrodes allow the mass production of reproducible, inexpensive and mechanically robust strip solid electrodes. Other important advantages of these electrodes are the possibility of miniaturization as well as their ease of manipulation in a disposable manner and therefore the use of small volumes. To detect transcriptional profiling and single nucleotide polymorphism thin-film arrays of 14, 20, 25, 48, and 64 electrodes have been fabricated, using lithographic techniques. Readout systems for these arrays based on electrical detection have also been developed. Moreover, a thick-film sensor array suitable for automation combined to readout based on intermittent pulse amperometry (IPA) has been commercialized. These genosensors and the readout instruments provide a simple, accurate and inexpensive platform for patient diagnosis. It is more than probable that arrays for 50\u2013100 DNA sequences will be needed for some clinical applications.

We identified a novel MERS-CoV-related betacoronavirus, Hp-BatCoV HKU25, from Chinese pipistrelle bats. Although it is closely related to MERS-CoV in most genome regions, its spike protein occupies a phylogenetic position between that of Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5. Because Ty-BatCoV HKU4 but not Pi-BatCoV HKU5 can use the MERS-CoV receptor human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) for cell entry, we tested the ability of Hp-BatCoV HKU25 to bind and use hDPP4. The HKU25-receptor binding domain (RBD) can bind to hDPP4 protein and hDPP4-expressing cells, but it does so with lower efficiency than that of MERS-RBD. Pseudovirus assays showed that HKU25-spike can use hDPP4 for entry to hDPP4-expressing cells, although with lower efficiency than that of MERS-spike and HKU4-spike. Our findings support a bat origin of MERS-CoV and suggest that bat CoV spike proteins may have evolved in a stepwise manner for binding to hDPP4.","publish_time":"2018-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Susanna K P; Zhang, Libiao; Luk, Hayes K H; Xiong, Lifeng; Peng, Xingwen; Li, Kenneth S M; He, Xiangyang; Zhao, Pyrear Su-Hui; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Wong, Antonio C P; Ahmed, Syed Shakeel; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chan, Jasper F W; Sun, Yinyan; Jin, Dongyan; Chen, Honglin; Lau, Terrence C K; Kok, Raven K H; Li, Wenhui; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Woo, Patrick C Y","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa7541796a3148ced3cb52b777459c801647391d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107427.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29346682/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-spike","novel MERS-CoV","MERS-RBD","HKU25-spike","hDPP4 protein","Hp-BatCoV HKU25","HKU4-spike","bat origin of MERS","Ty-BatCoV HKU4","bat CoV spike proteins","Pi-BatCoV HKU5","MERS-CoV receptor human dipeptidyl peptidase","HKU25-receptor binding domain","related betacoronavirus","role of bats","related viruses","cells","lower efficiency","Chinese pipistrelle bats","evolutionary origin","ability of Hp","cell entry","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","genome regions","phylogenetic position","pathway","stepwise manner","Pseudovirus assays","findings"],"language":"en"},

When TBI was reduced to 1 Gy, only transient engraftment was observed. Here we investigated whether stable engraftment after 1-Gy TBI could be accomplished by reducing host-versus-donor immune responsiveness through preceding CD154 blockade and infusion of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We found that the anti-human CD154 antibody, 5c8, cross-reacted with canine lymphocytes and blocked alloimmune responses in vitro. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, 6 dogs received a single intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg anti-CD154 antibody (on day \u22125), followed 1 day later by donor PBMCs. On day 0, the dogs were given 1 Gy of TBI and underwent DLA-identical marrow grafts. Postgraft immunosuppression consisted of MMF and CSP. All 6 dogs demonstrated initial engraftment; 3 dogs sustained the engraftment for \u003E26 weeks, whereas 3 dogs rejected their grafts, after 9, 22, and 24 weeks, and survived with autologous recovery.

Importantly, much of the disease burden and health care utilisation in COPD is associated with the management of its comorbidities (e.g. skeletal muscle wasting, ischemic heart disease, cognitive dysfunction) and infective viral and bacterial acute exacerbations (AECOPD). Current pharmacological treatments for COPD are relatively ineffective and the development of effective therapies has been severely hampered by the lack of understanding of the mechanisms and mediators underlying COPD. Since comorbidities have a tremendous impact on the prognosis and severity of COPD, the 2015 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Research Statement on COPD urgently called for studies to elucidate the pathobiological mechanisms linking COPD to its comorbidities. It is now emerging that up to 50% of COPD patients have metabolic syndrome (MetS) as a comorbidity. It is currently not clear whether metabolic syndrome is an independent co-existing condition or a direct consequence of the progressive lung pathology in COPD patients. As MetS has important clinical implications on COPD outcomes, identification of disease mechanisms linking COPD to MetS is the key to effective therapy. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the potential mechanisms linking MetS to COPD and hence plausible therapeutic strategies to treat this debilitating comorbidity of COPD.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Stanley M.H.; Selemidis, Stavros; Bozinovski, Steven; Vlahos, Ross","journal":"Pharmacology \u0026 Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0c464060a220478a12604e6ee37141c9ca89d8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112632.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30822464/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2019.02.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725819300336; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725819300336","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society","MetS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD patients","COPD outcomes","severity of COPD","debilitating comorbidity of COPD","MetS","disease burden","identification of disease mechanisms","comorbidities","potential mechanisms","pathobiological mechanisms","ischemic heart disease","metabolic syndrome","Abstract Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","effective therapy","major incurable global health burden","European Respiratory Society","American Thoracic Society","health care utilisation","development of effective therapies","direct consequence","ATS","independent co-existing condition","cognitive dysfunction","progressive lung pathology","important clinical implications","skeletal muscle","bacterial acute exacerbations","plausible therapeutic strategies","Research Statement","AECOPD","tremendous impact","prognosis","studies","key","Current pharmacological treatments","largest cause of death","world","management","mediators","comprehensive review","lack of understanding"],"language":"en"},

In addition, adenovirus cocirculates with enterovirus and has become a possible additional pathogenic factor for HFMD in some cases. Here, we have investigated the neutralizing antibody responses to both enterovirus and adenovirus in adults, with the aim of exploring the prevalence trends of these viruses and the nature of protective immunity in humans to these viral infections. Sera from 391 healthy adults from 21 provinces and cities in China were tested for the presence of antibodies against EV71, CA16, adenovirus human serotype 5 (AdHu5) and chimpanzee adenovirus pan7 (AdC7) using neutralization tests. High seroprevalence rates of EV71, CA16 and AdHu5 were found in the population (85.7%, 58.8% and 74.2%, respectively). The coseropositivity rate of these three viruses was 39.4% (154 of 391), with median neutralizing antibody titers of 80, 40 and 640, respectively, and the neutralizing antibody titer for EV71 was found to be correlated with those of CA16 and AdHu5. AdC7 was found to be a rare adenovirus serotype in the human population, with a seropositivity rate of 11.8%, suggesting that it could be a good choice for a vaccine carrier that could be used in vaccine development.","publish_time":"2014-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiang; Xing, Man; Zhang, Chao; Yang, Yong; Chi, Yudan; Tang, Xinying; Zhang, Hongbo; Xiong, Sidong; Yu, Luogang; Zhou, Dongming","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77cdb9f7f5451fd710304093391bca2637411c85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4051363.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038738/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2014.30","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFMD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["CA16","adenovirus human serotype","adenovirus cocirculates","AdHu5","rare adenovirus serotype","chimpanzee adenovirus pan7","neutralizing antibody responses","human population","healthy adults","median neutralizing antibody titers","AdC7","High seroprevalence rates of EV71","major causative agents of HFMD","mouth disease","severe disease","years old","vaccine carrier","coseropositivity rate","vaccine development","nature of protective immunity","humans","possible additional pathogenic factor","important public health problem","provinces","cities","foot","aim","presence of antibodies","viral infections","prevalence trends","neutralization tests","China","good choice","Hand","cases","children","coxsackievirus","past","Sera","enteroviruses"],"language":"en"},

Thus, TRIM52 is a novel antiviral TRIM protein, and it exerted antiviral activity against JEV infection by targeting and degrading viral NS2A.","publish_time":"2016-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Wenchun; Wu, Mengge; Qian, Suhong; Zhou, Yun; Chen, Huanchun; Li, Xiangmin; Qian, Ping","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/958d54d13cbc0341fe590ba4eeb59e2a0b4fca51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5035999.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27667714/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep33698","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity","novel antiviral TRIM protein","JEV nonstructural protein","E3 ligase activity of TRIM52","TRIM proteins","JEV infection","host antiviral function","viral NS2A","Overexpression of TRIM52 restricted JEV replication","viral proteins","host innate immunity","Japanese encephalitis virus","important role","BHK","proteasome-dependent manner","various cellular processes","motif","time","addition","members of tripartite","T cells","interaction","study"],"language":"en"},

All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for six questions. The topics were: 1) infection control, 2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, 3) hemodynamic support, 4) ventilatory support, and 5) COVID-19 therapy. CONCLUSION: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.

This acknowledgement is a consequence of improvement in diagnosis and better understanding of transmission. Available vaccines and antiviral drugs for prophylaxis and treatment have been developed accordingly. Viral respiratory pathogens are increasingly recognized as nosocomial pathogens as well. The purpose of this review is to describe the most frequent and relevant nosocomial viral respiratory infections, their mechanisms of transmission and the infection control measures to prevent their spread in the healthcare setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Although most mechanisms of transmission and control measures of nosocomial viral infections are already known, improved diagnostic tools allow better characterization of these infections and also lead to the discovery of new viruses such as the coronavirus, which is the cause of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or the human bocavirus. Also, the ability to understand better the impact, dissemination and prevention of these viruses, allows us to improve the measures to prevent these infections. SUMMARY: Healthcare viral respiratory infections increase patient morbidity. Each virus has a different mechanism of transmission; therefore, early detection and prompt implementation of infection control measures are very important in order to avoid their transmission in the hospital setting.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonveh\u00ED, Pablo E.; Temporiti, Elena R.","journal":"Curr Treat Options Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bf1d9a2e53cd72c53a76930f5b37d4957678417.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099383.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40506-018-0163-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226322/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Healthcare viral respiratory infections","control measures of nosocomial viral infections","relevant nosocomial viral respiratory infections","Viral respiratory pathogens","mechanisms of transmission","better understanding of transmission","nosocomial pathogens","different mechanism of transmission","prompt implementation of infection control measures","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","better characterization","healthcare setting","REVIEW","PURPOSE","hospital setting","non-immunocompromised hosts","cause of severe illness","discovery of new viruses","early detection","improved diagnostic tools","antiviral drugs","prophylaxis","diagnosis","spread","patient morbidity","consequence of improvement","Available vaccines","order","SUMMARY","human bocavirus","impact","treatment","dissemination","prevention","coronavirus","RECENT FINDINGS","acknowledgement","ability"],"language":"en"},

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are commonly used to detect SBV-specific antibodies in bulk tank milk samples to monitor herd exposure to infection. However, it has previously been shown that a bulk tank milk sample can test positive even though the majority of cows within the herd are seronegative for SBV antibodies. Development of a pen-side test to detect antibodies in individual milk samples would potentially provide a cheaper test (for which samples are obtained non-invasively) than testing individual serum samples by ELISA. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the agreement between antibody levels measured in milk and serum. RESULTS: Corresponding milk and serum samples from 88 cows in two dairy herds in the UK were tested for presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies to SBV using a commercially-available indirect ELISA. A serum neutralisation test (NT) was also performed as a gold standard assay. The ELISA values obtained for the bulk tank milk samples corresponded with the mean values for individual milk samples from each herd (bulk tank milk values were 58% and 73% and mean individual milk values 50% and 63% for herds A and B, respectively). Of the 88 serum samples tested in the NT, 82 (93%) were positive. Although at higher antibody levels, the ELISA values tended to be higher for the individual milk samples than for the corresponding serum samples, the positive predictive value for milk samples was 98% and for serum samples 94%. The serum ELISA was more likely to give false positive results around the lower cut-off value of the assay. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that testing of individual milk samples for antibodies against SBV by ELISA could be used to inform decisions in the management of dairy herds such as which, if any, animals to vaccinate.","publish_time":"2015-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daly, Janet M; King, Barnabas; Tarlinton, Rachael A; Gough, Kevin C; Maddison, Ben C; Blowey, Roger","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/466c7e2cf0d7aae1c4595ce0bb752df2bbaeb033.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4381408.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0365-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25890260/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Schmallenberg"],"organizations":["SBV","UK"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["individual serum samples","bulk tank milk samples","testing of individual milk samples","individual milk values","corresponding serum samples","serum ELISA","Corresponding milk","bulk tank milk values","ELISA values","SBV antibodies","serum neutralisation test","SBV-specific antibodies","mean values","available indirect ELISA","false positive results","cheaper test","positive predictive value","herd exposure","presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies","higher antibody levels","management of dairy herds","majority of cows","Schmallenberg virus","lower cut-off value","emerged virus of ruminants","gold standard assay","UK","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","decisions","agreement","Europe","BACKGROUND","pen","infection","study","Development","CONCLUSIONS","aim","animals"],"language":"en"},

Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), nasal cavity and brain tissue samples were obtained from 1 to 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) of infected and control chickens. Viral antigen topographical distribution, presence of influenza A virus receptors in the brain, as well as, the role of the olfactory route in virus CNS invasion were studied using different immunohistochemistry techniques. Besides, viral RNA load in CSF and blood was quantified by means of a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Viral antigen was observed widely distributed in the CNS, showing bilateral and symmetrical distribution in the nuclei of the diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Viral RNA was detected in blood and CSF at one dpi, indicating that the virus crosses the blood-CSF-barrier early during infection. This early dissemination is possibly favoured by the presence of Sia\u03B12,3 Gal and Sia\u03B12,6 Gal receptors in brain vascular endothelial cells, and Sia\u03B12,3 Gal receptors in ependymal and choroid plexus cells. No viral antigen was observed in olfactory sensory neurons, while the olfactory bulb showed only weak staining, suggesting that the virus did not use this pathway to enter into the brain. The sequence of virus appearance and the topographical distribution of this H7N1 HPAIV indicate that the viral entry occurs via the haematogenous route, with early and generalized spreading through the CSF.","publish_time":"2011-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaves, Aida J; Busquets, N\u00FAria; Valle, Rosa; Rivas, Raquel; Vergara-Alert, J\u00FAlia; Dolz, Roser; Ramis, Antonio; Darji, Ayub; Maj\u00F3, Nat\u00E0lia","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c5eab753837b6723778e80b1d37a32bee2b4375.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3199250.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21982125/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-42-106","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus receptors","blood-CSF","Viral antigen topographical distribution","viral entry","virus CNS invasion","Gal receptors","viral RNA load","sequence of virus appearance","olfactory route","presence of Sia\u03B12","pathogenic avian influenza virus","H7N1 HPAIV","presence of influenza","olfactory bulb","symmetrical distribution","brain vascular endothelial cells","control chickens","brain tissue samples","early dissemination","olfactory sensory neurons","haematogenous route","specific pathogen free chickens","choroid plexus cells","nasal cavity","quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","nuclei","central nervous system","cerebrospinal fluid","generalized spreading","mechanism of neuroinvasion","diencephalon","different immunohistochemistry techniques","weak staining","mesencephalon","barrier","role","days post-inoculation","rhombencephalon","order","infection","pathway"],"language":"en"},

Signaling by RNA and DNA receptors results in the induction of restriction factors that prevent virus replication and establish cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity. In light of these formidable obstacles, viruses have evolved mechanisms of evasion, masking nucleic acid structures recognized by the host, sequestering themselves away from the cytosol or targeting host sensors, and signaling adaptors for deactivation or degradation. Here, we detail recent advances in the molecular understanding of cytosolic nucleic acid detection and its evasion by viruses.","publish_time":"2013-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goubau, Delphine; Deddouche, Safia; Reis e Sousa, Caetano","journal":"Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bde3557017d639cff7b80c422cb81c21089d350.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f5cde32a4ef1d4e696b5a84c8fa3e83e1c695290.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111113.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761313002045; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761313002045; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2013.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23706667/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viruses","nucleic acid structures","DNA receptors results","presence of atypical nucleic acids","evolved mechanisms of evasion","host sensors","defense mechanisms","uninfected host","molecular understanding of cytosolic nucleic acid detection","virus replication","virus infection","abnormal presence","RNA molecules","cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity","induction of restriction factors","formidable obstacles","adaptors","recent advances","deactivation","light","degradation","Cells","RIG"],"language":"en"},

GL is also known to exhibit various biological activities, including anti-viral effects, but the anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) effect of GL remains to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that GL treatment of HCV-infected Huh7 cells caused a reduction of infectious HCV production using cell culture-produced HCV (HCVcc). To determine the target step in the HCV lifecycle of GL, we used HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), replicon, and HCVcc systems. Significant suppressions of viral entry and replication steps were not observed. Interestingly, extracellular infectivity was decreased, and intracellular infectivity was increased. By immunofluorescence and electron microscopic analysis of GL treated cells, HCV core antigens and electron-dense particles had accumulated on endoplasmic reticulum attached to lipid droplet (LD), respectively, which is thought to act as platforms for HCV assembly. Furthermore, the amount of HCV core antigen in LD fraction increased. Taken together, these results suggest that GL inhibits release of infectious HCV particles. GL is known to have an inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2 (PLA2). We found that group 1B PLA2 (PLA2G1B) inhibitor also decreased HCV release, suggesting that suppression of virus release by GL treatment may be due to its inhibitory effect on PLA2G1B. Finally, we demonstrated that combination treatment with GL augmented IFN-induced reduction of virus in the HCVcc system. GL is identified as a novel anti-HCV agent that targets infectious virus particle release.","publish_time":"2013-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matsumoto, Yoshihiro; Matsuura, Tomokazu; Aoyagi, Haruyo; Matsuda, Mami; Hmwe, Su Su; Date, Tomoko; Watanabe, Noriyuki; Watashi, Koichi; Suzuki, Ryosuke; Ichinose, Shizuko; Wake, Kenjiro; Suzuki, Tetsuro; Miyamura, Tatsuo; Wakita, Takaji; Aizaki, Hideki","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2e8d9291e399c6d8adc6d39318de197e86b3f4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3715454.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23874843/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068992","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GL","HCV"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["GL treatment of HCV","HCV release","HCV lifecycle of GL","effect of GL","HCV pseudoparticles","HCV assembly","release of infectious HCV particles","HCV core antigens","reduction of infectious HCV production","novel anti-HCV agent","electron microscopic analysis of GL","GL augmented IFN-induced reduction of virus","infectious virus particle release","suppression of virus release","anti-hepatitis C virus","inhibitory effect","anti-viral effects","chronic viral hepatitis","combination treatment","PLA2G1B","HCVcc systems","electron-dense particles","Significant suppressions of viral entry","B PLA2","LD fraction","intracellular infectivity","extracellular infectivity","infected Huh7 cells","anti-inflammatory drug","cell culture","endoplasmic reticulum","various biological activities","replicon","serum alanine aminotransferase levels","replication steps","lipid droplet","patients","phospholipase A2","immunofluorescence","Japan","HCVpp","target step","group","platforms","study","results","Glycyrrhizin"],"language":"en"},

IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p \u003C 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p \u003C 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Using two parental DI RNAs, MIDI and MIDI\u0394H, a twin set of deletion mutants was generated with progressively shorter stretches of 5\u2032 sequence colinear with the genomic RNA. All deletion mutants contained in-frame ORFs. We show that in transfected cells and after one passage the DI RNAs were detectable and that their accumulation was positively correlated with the length of 5\u2032 sequence they contained. However, accumulation of two twin mutants, \u03942, in which sequences from nucleotide position 467 were fused to those from position 801, was undetectable. In passage 4 cells, but not in transfected or in passage 1 cells, recombination with genomic RNA led to the appearance of the parental DI RNAs. The accumulation of these parental RNAs was inversely correlated with the length of 5\u2032 sequence on the deletion mutants and was highest in the \u03942 samples. In sharp contrast to the data reported for MHV-JHM-derived DI RNAs, we show that MHV-A59-derived mutant RNAs do not require an internal sequence domain for replication. The data suggest that coronavirus replication involves an RNA superstructure at the 5\u2032 end of the genome or one comprising both ends of the genomic RNA. We also conclude from the recombination data that in-frame mutants with impaired replication signals are more fit than out-frame mutants with intact replication signals.","publish_time":"1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"LUYTJES, WILLEM; GERRITSMA, HELEEN; SPAAN, WILLY J.M.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a141853a697536211afce4eea74390785e288f42.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682296900446; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682296900446","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DI RNAs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frame mutants","parental DI RNAs","derived DI RNAs","parental RNAs","twin mutants","derived mutant RNAs","replication of deletion mutants of defective interfering","MHV-A59","twin set of deletion mutants","coronavirus replication","genomic RNA","passage","accumulation","impaired replication signals","intact replication signals","MHV-JHM","presence of MHV","RNA superstructure","recombination data","transfected cells","frame ORFs","internal sequence domain","length","\u03942 samples","nucleotide position","coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","MIDI\u0394H","appearance","end","comprising","sequences","shorter stretches","sharp contrast","genome"],"language":"en"},

We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data.

Though ARDS diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, biological markers of acute lung damage have been extensively studied in adults and children. Biomarkers of inflammation, alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial disruption, disordered coagulation, and associated derangements measured in the circulation and other body fluids, such as bronchoalveolar lavage, have improved our understanding of pathobiology of ARDS. The biochemical signature of ARDS has been increasingly well described in adult populations, and this has led to the identification of molecular phenotypes to augment clinical classifications. However, there is a paucity of data from pediatric ARDS (pARDS) patients. Biomarkers and molecular phenotypes have the potential to identify patients at high risk of poor outcomes, and perhaps inform the development of targeted therapies for specific groups of patients. Additionally, because of the lower incidence of and mortality from ARDS in pediatric patients relative to adults and lack of robust clinical predictors of outcome, there is an ongoing interest in biological markers as surrogate outcome measures. The recent definition of pARDS provides additional impetus for the measurement of established and novel biomarkers in future pediatric studies in order to further characterize this disease process. This chapter will review the currently available literature and discuss potential future directions for investigation into biomarkers in ARDS among children.","publish_time":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Orwoll, Benjamin E.; Sapru, Anil","journal":"Front Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/364f3e45183f362e8398724c29d3b010436ce375.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4887507.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2016.00055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27313995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pediatric ARDS","ARDS diagnosis","pediatric patients relative","biochemical signature of ARDS","Biomarkers of inflammation","novel biomarkers","future pediatric studies","clinical criteria","adults","specific groups of patients","clinical classifications","ventilated children","potential future directions","identification of molecular phenotypes","lack of robust clinical predictors of outcome","biological markers of acute lung damage","pediatric intensive care unit deaths","surrogate outcome measures","recent definition of pARDS","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","capillary endothelial disruption","disordered coagulation","mortality","investigation","additional impetus","development of targeted therapies","available literature","measurement","high risk of poor outcomes","associated derangements","body fluids","bronchoalveolar lavage","circulation","paucity of data","understanding of pathobiology","lower incidence","disease process","chapter","adult populations"],"language":"en"},

A unique packaging strategy, involving recognition of briding viral RNA by both Pol precursor and Gag as well as potential Gag-Pol protein interactions, ensures Pol particle encapsidation. RESULTS: Several Prototype FV (PFV) Gag-Pol fusion protein constructs were generated to examine whether PFV replication is compatible with an orthoretroviral-like Pol expression. During their analysis, non-particle-associated secreted Pol precursor protein was discovered in extracellular wild type PFV particle preparations of different origin, copurifying in simple virion enrichment protocols. Different analysis methods suggest that extracellular wild type PFV particles contain predominantly mature p85(PR-RT )and p40(IN )Pol subunits. Characterization of various PFV Gag-Pol fusion constructs revealed that PFV Pol expression in an orthoretroviral manner is compatible with PFV replication as long as a proteolytic processing between Gag and Pol proteins is possible. PFV Gag-Pol translation by a HIV-1 like ribosomal frameshift signal resulted in production of replication-competent virions, although cell- and particle-associated Pol levels were reduced in comparison to wild type. In-frame fusion of PFV Gag and Pol ORFs led to increased cellular Pol levels, but particle incorporation was only marginally elevated. Unlike that reported for similar orthoretroviral constructs, a full-length in-frame PFV Gag-Pol fusion construct showed wildtype-like particle release and infectivity characteristics. In contrast, in-frame PFV Gag-Pol fusion with C-terminal Gag ORF truncations or non-removable Gag peptide addition to Pol displayed wildtype particle release, but reduced particle infectivity. PFV Gag-Pol precursor fusion proteins with inactivated protease were highly deficient in regular particle release, although coexpression of p71(Gag )resulted in a significant copackaging of these proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Non-particle associated PFV Pol appears to be naturally released from infected cells by a yet unknown mechanism. The absence of particle-associated Pol precursor suggests its rapid processing upon particle incorporation. Analysis of different PFV Gag-Pol fusion constructs demonstrates that orthoretroviral-like Pol expression is compatible with FV replication in principal as long as fusion protein processing is possible. Furthermore, unlike orthoretroviruses, PFV particle release and infectivity tolerate larger differences in relative cellular Gag/Pol levels.","publish_time":"2011-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Swiersy, Anka; Wiek, Constanze; Reh, Juliane; Zentgraf, Hanswalter; Lindemann, Dirk","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ae484254680cec3d9d6f6d55bfd97bd90877445.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3196705.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-8-66; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21843316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pol"],"organizations":["PFV","PFV Pol","PFV Gag","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PFV Pol expression","PFV Gag-Pol translation","Pol proteins","Pol ORFs","Pol particle encapsidation","Pol subunits","PFV Gag-Pol precursor fusion proteins","Gag-Pol fusion protein constructs","frame PFV Gag-Pol fusion construct","associated Pol precursor","particle-associated Pol levels","frame fusion of PFV Gag","Analysis of different PFV Gag-Pol fusion constructs","PFV particle release","Characterization of various PFV Gag-Pol fusion constructs","potential Gag-Pol protein interactions","PFV replication","orthoretroviruses express Pol","secreted Pol precursor protein","non-particle","increased cellular Pol levels","particle incorporation","absence of particle","relative cellular Gag","wildtype particle release","regular particle release","fusion protein processing","reduced particle infectivity","extracellular wild type PFV particle preparations of different origin","extracellular wild type PFV particles","non-removable Gag peptide addition","C-terminal Gag ORF truncations","separate precursor protein","similar orthoretroviral constructs","production of replication","orthoretroviral manner","Different analysis methods","rapid processing","proteolytic processing","infectivity characteristics","Prototype FV","copurifying","larger differences","inactivated protease","mature p85","recognition of briding viral RNA","FVs","HIV","principal","simple virion enrichment protocols","ribosomal frameshift signal","comparison","PR-RT","Foamy viruses","competent virions","coexpression of p71","unique packaging strategy","p40","CONCLUSIONS","infected cells","unknown mechanism","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","significant copackaging","contrast"],"language":"en"},

In this article, we provide a preliminary phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis of this new virus. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using the 29 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV and two whole genome sequences that are highly similar sequences from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus available in GeneBank. We are able to clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the 2019-nCoV sequence isolates from their patients. The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019\u20132020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family. In agreement with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019-nCoV time of the most recent common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November 25(th), 2019. These results, together with previously recorded epidemics, suggest a recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks due to Betacoronavirus. Moreover, our study describes the same population genetic dynamic underlying the SARS 2003 epidemic, and suggests the urgent need for the development of effective molecular surveillance strategies of Betacoronavirus among animals and Rhinolophus of the bat family.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benvenuto, Domenico; Giovanetti, Marta; Salemi, Marco; Prosperi, Mattia; De Flora, Cecilia; Junior Alcantara, Luiz Carlos; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo","journal":"Pathog Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b78e4e578cbc0ab052f2c778e5474874cd95cc0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ed37a218796ec0db84b52ccdd509fc71b7c1064c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099638.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32048560/; https://doi.org/10.1080/20477724.2020.1725339","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Maximum Clade Credibility"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Bat SARS","nCoV time","Rhinolophus bat family","genome sequences","nCoV sequence isolates","similar sequences","Coronavirus available","phylogeographic analysis","molecular clock analysis","new outbreak","new virus","development of effective molecular surveillance strategies of Betacoronavirus","Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction","animals","likely geographic origin","recurring pattern of periodical epizootic outbreaks","population genetic dynamic","recent common ancestor","epidemiological observations","urgent need","preliminary phylodynamic","recorded epidemics","city of Wuhan","China","mechanism of transmission","Maximum Clade Credibility tree","study","patients","GeneBank","risk assessment","countries","results","agreement","article","global spread","fast moving","th"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the causative agent. Methods Cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocyte co-cultures were used to isolate the causative agent from clinical samples. Identity of the agent was established by electron microscopy and serological and molecular assays. Findings Clinical samples tested negative for IgM antibodies to Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, dengue, and measles viruses, and for RNA of coronavirus, paramyxovirus, enterovirus, and influenza viruses. Virus was isolated from six patients with encephalitis and was identified as Chandipura virus by electron microscopy, complement fixation, and neutralisation tests. Chandipura virus RNA was detected in clinical samples from nine patients. Sequencing of five of these RNA samples showed 96\u00B77\u201397\u00B75% identity with the reference strain of 1965. Chandipura viral antigen and RNA were detected in brain tissue of a deceased child by immunofluorescent antibody test and PCR.

Using an SIV macaque model of AIDS and CNS disease, our overall goal was to assess how the expression of genes associated with immune and inflammatory responses are longitudinally changed in different organs or cells during SIV infection. To compare RNA expression of a panel of 88 immune-related genes across time points and among three tissues \u2013 spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) \u2013 we designed a set of Nanostring probes. To identify significant genes during acute SIV infection and to investigate whether these genes are tissue-specific or have global roles, we introduce a novel multiplexed component analysis (MCA) method. This combines multivariate analysis methods with multiple preprocessing methods to create a set of 12 \u201Cjudges\u201D; each judge emphasizes particular types of change in gene expression to which cells could respond, for example, the absolute or relative size of expression change from baseline. Compared to bivariate analysis methods, our MCA method improved classification rates. This analysis allows us to identify three categories of genes: (a) consensus genes likely to contribute highly to the immune response; (b) genes that would contribute highly to the immune response only if certain assumptions are met \u2013 e.g. that the cell responds to relative expression change rather than absolute expression change; and (c) genes whose contribution to immune response appears to be modest. We then compared the results across the three tissues of interest; some genes are consistently highly-contributing in all tissues, while others are specific for certain tissues. Our analysis identified CCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11, MxA, OAS2, and OAS1 as top contributing genes, all of which are stimulated by type I interferon. This suggests that the cytokine storm during acute SIV infection is a systemic innate immune response against viral replication. Furthermore, these genes have approximately equal contributions to all tissues, making them possible candidates to be used as non-invasive biomarkers in studying PBMCs instead of MLN and spleen during acute SIV infection experiments. We identified clusters of genes that co-vary together and studied their correlation with regard to other gene clusters. We also developed novel methods to faithfully visualize multi-gene correlations on two-dimensional polar plots, and to visualize tissue specificity of gene expression responses.","publish_time":"2015-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosseini, Iraj; Gama, Lucio; Mac Gabhann, Feilim","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7de0d0ac71e79cba5b50ed89303cae6d89bb0130.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4436129.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25984721/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV","CNS","MCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of genes","Immune response genes","clusters of genes","contributing genes","immune-related genes","significant genes","categories of genes","consensus genes likely","relative expression change","absolute expression change","acute SIV infection experiments","RNA expression","relative size of expression change","systemic innate immune response","certain tissues","multivariate analysis methods","bivariate analysis methods","tissue specificity of gene expression responses","novel methods","gene clusters","acute HIV","SIV macaque model of AIDS","novel multiplexed component analysis","MLN","spleen","particular types of change","multi-gene correlations","multiple preprocessing methods","MCA method","tissue-specific","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","inflammatory responses","certain assumptions","set of Nanostring probes","important role","CNS disease","two-dimensional polar plots","mesenteric lymph nodes","different organs","time points","MxA","OAS2","CXCL10","CXCL11","viral replication","panel","global roles","non-invasive biomarkers","overall goal","PBMCs","CCL8","example","OAS1","baseline","cytokine storm","possible candidates","classification rates","judges","regard","equal contributions","results","interferon"],"language":"en"},

These results provide firm evidence that kobuviruses are common constituents of feline enteric viroma and that they are not geographically restricted to the Asian continent, where they were first signalled.","publish_time":"2015-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Martino, Barbara; Di Profio, Federica; Melegari, Irene; Marsilio, Fulvio; Martella, Vito","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b48fcc91cd078fd61de5a67d247546506c322e0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117564.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515000292; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.01.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25631253/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515000292","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feline kobuviruses","enteric pathogens","enteric tract","Abstract Kobuviruses","common constituents of feline enteric viroma","mammalian species","ITA","firm evidence","strains","role","diarrhoea","highest nucleotide identity","results","full-length genome","prototype strain FK","asymptomatic animals","study","Asian continent","cats"],"language":"en"},

Murine monoclonal and sheep polyclonal antibodies (mAbs and pAbs) to feline IFN-\u03B3 (fIFN-\u03B3) were generated firstly to facilitate further research into the role of cellular immune responses in the control of feline infectious disease, and secondly to enable evaluation of the efficacy of novel immunotherapeutic approaches. A hybridoma clone, D9, secreting IgG1 antibodies was selected for expansion and the mAbs affinity purified in vitro. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in a sheep against recombinant fIFN-\u03B3 and affinity purified. The sensitivity of the D9 mAb and the sheep anti-fIFN-\u03B3 pAb was determined using an indirect fIFN-\u03B3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblots. These antibodies were assessed for their ability to detect the production of fIFN-\u03B3 by specific feline T cell populations ex vivo following coculture with mitogen or feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigens for 4 h in the presence of the protein secretion inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). Production of fIFN-\u03B3 was evaluated using flow cytometry to simultaneously detect PE-labelled surface molecules and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled intracellular fIFN-\u03B3. Using this approach, our initial studies revealed an upregulation in virus-specific fIFN-\u03B3-secreting CD4\u002BT cells in the lymph nodes of FeLV latently infected cats.","publish_time":"2003-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graham, Elizabeth M.; Jarrett, Oswald; Flynn, J.Norman","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/595b4da638d33d86ed49b55090e444a9aad479fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125904.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175903002448; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175903002448","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intracellular fIFN-\u03B3","recombinant fIFN-\u03B3","interferon-\u03B3","virus-specific fIFN-\u03B3","feline IFN-\u03B3","production of fIFN","sheep anti-fIFN-\u03B3 pAb","indirect fIFN-\u03B3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","sheep polyclonal antibodies","control of feline infectious disease","feline leukaemia virus","secreting IgG1 antibodies","control of infectious disease","mAbs affinity","specific feline T cell populations ex","role of cellular immune responses","role of immune effector products","nature of immune protection","T cells","secreting CD4","D9 mAb","immunotherapeutic reagents","lymph nodes of FeLV","PE-labelled surface molecules","efficacy of novel immunotherapeutic approaches","coculture","mitogen","pAbs","rational design of effective vaccines","presence","fluorescein isothiocyanate","FITC","antigens","protein secretion inhibitor brefeldin","upregulation","expansion","hybridoma clone","BFA","ELISA","initial studies","infected cats","evaluation","flow cytometry","understanding","research","ability","sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we assayed A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2), and X31 (H3N2) influenza virus strains for binding and infection on fully differentiated primary cultures of airway epithelia isolated from human bronchus, grown on semiporous filters at an air\u2013liquid interface. In this model system, viral infectivity was highest when virus was applied to the apical versus the basolateral surface; Japan was most infectious, followed by PR8. The X31 strain showed very low levels of infectivity. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence-resonance energy transfer studies indicated that Japan virus could enter and fuse with cellular membranes, while infection with X31 virions was greatly inhibited. Japan virus could also productively infect human trachea explant tissues. These data show that influenza viruses with SA\u03B12,3Gal binding specificity, like Japan, productively infect differentiated human airway epithelia from the apical surface.

An example of this class of proteins is the mRNA-targeting endoribonuclease SOX from the gamma-herpesvirus Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Previous studies indicated that cleavage of messenger RNAs (mRNA) by SOX occurs at specific locations defined by the sequence of the target RNA, which is at odds with the down-regulation of a large portion of cellular transcripts. In this study, we address this paradox by using high-throughput sequencing of cleavage intermediates combined with a custom bioinformatics-based analysis pipeline to identify SOX cleavage sites across the mRNA transcriptome. These data, coupled with targeted mutagenesis, reveal that while cleavage sites are specific and reproducible, they are defined by a degenerate sequence motif containing a small number of conserved residues rather than a strong consensus sequence. This degenerate element is well represented in both human and KSHV mRNA, and its presence correlates with RNA destabilization by SOX.

This interest has also resulted in competition for funding and turf wars between animal health and public health scientists and public officials and, in some cases, has delayed and hindered progress toward effective prevention, control and biodefense. There is a dynamic list of outbreaks causing substantial morbidity and mortality in humans and often in the reservoir animal species. Some agents have the potential to grow into major epidemics. There are many determinants that influence the emergence of diseases of concern that require the use of current understanding of the nature of agent persistence and spread. Additional factors that are global must be added to plans for prevention and control. To this complex mix has been added the potential for accidental or malicious release of agents. The nature of emerging infectious agents and their impact is largely unpredictable. Models that strive to predict the dynamics of agents may be useful but can also blind us to increasing disease risks if it does not match a specific model. Field investigations of early events will be critical and should drive prevention and control actions. Many disease agents have developed strategies to overcome extremes of reservoir qualities like population size and density. Every infectious agent spreads easier when its hosts are closer together. Zoonoses must be dealt with at the interface of human and animal health by all available information. Lessons learned from the emergence of and response to agents like West Nile virus, H5N1 avian influenza, SARS and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the cause of new-variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease in humans, must be used to create better plans for response and meet the challenge for public health and biodefense.","publish_time":"2008-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murphy, Frederick A.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c177c92fabb17650a054195ec071ec799e574998.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126876.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587708000548; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587708000548; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.02.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18378340/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease agents","animal health","public health scientists","dynamics of agents","nature of emerging infectious agents","public health infectious disease research community","public officials","malicious release of agents","Jakob disease","disease risks","humans","response","reservoir animal species","potential","emerging diseases","effective prevention","emergence of diseases","biodefense","control actions","nature of agent persistence","cause of new","concept of new","better plans","extremes of reservoir qualities","H5N1 avian influenza","West Nile virus","SARS","bovine spongiform encephalopathy","turf wars","substantial morbidity","variant Creutzfeldt","population size","use of current understanding","hindered progress","funding","strategies","challenge","dynamic list of outbreaks","density","mortality","concern","cases","hosts","impact","Field investigations of early events","interface of human","available information","competition","Additional factors","major epidemics","complex mix","determinants","specific model","Models","Lessons","Zoonoses"],"language":"en"},

Raised progenitor cell recruitment after major events and clonal hematopoiesis related mechanisms have provided an improved understanding of factors regulating inflammatory phenomena. Trials with inflammation antagonists have led to an extensive evaluation of biomarkers such as the high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), not exerting a causative role, but frequently indicative of the individual cardiovascular (CV) risk. Aim of this review is to provide indication on the anti-inflammatory profile of agents of general use in CV prevention, i.e. affecting lipids, blood pressure, diabetes as well nutraceuticals such as n-3 fatty acids. A crucial issue in the evaluation of the benefit of the anti-inflammatory activity is the frequent discordance between a beneficial activity on a major risk factor and associated changes of hsCRP, as in the case of statins vs PCSK9 antagonists. In hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors exert an optimal anti-inflammatory activity, vs the case of sartans. The remarkable preventive activity of SLGT-2 inhibitors in heart failure is not associated with a clear anti-inflammatory mechanism. Finally, icosapent ethyl has been shown to reduce the CV risk in hypertriglyceridemia, with a 27% reduction of hsCRP. The inflammation-based approach to arterial disease has considerably gained from an improved understanding of the clinical diagnostic strategy and from a better knowledge on the mode of action of numerous agents, including nutraceuticals.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruscica, Massimiliano; Corsini, Alberto; Ferri, Nicola; Banach, Maciej; Sirtori, Cesare R.","journal":"Pharmacological research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74cc88c60223c1e334877357fbba94f693f0e126.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445957/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104366182031224X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S104366182031224X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104916","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimal anti-inflammatory activity","beneficial activity","CV risk","inflammatory activity of cholesterol","inflammation antagonists","anti-inflammatory profile of agents","major risk factor","remarkable preventive activity of SLGT","CV prevention","nutraceuticals","clear anti-inflammatory mechanism","associated changes of hsCRP","reduction of hsCRP","ABSTRACT Inflammation","improved understanding of factors","inflammation-based approach","case of statins vs PCSK9 antagonists","major events","enzyme inhibitors","numerous agents","obligatory marker of arterial disease","case of sartans","inflammatory phenomena","well-established molecular mechanisms","extensive evaluation of biomarkers","clonal hematopoiesis related mechanisms","general use","high sensitivity C reactive protein","clinical diagnostic strategy","better knowledge","mode of action","diabetes","progenitor cell recruitment","lipids","frequent discordance","blood pressure","angiotensin","indication","benefit","heart failure","hypertension","hypertriglyceridemia","fatty acids","causative role","crucial issue","Trials","icosapent ethyl","review"],"language":"en"},

IMGT/V-QUEST database was applied to analyze the isolated VH and VL sequences. To confirm the correction of isolated VH/VL, 3 HuMAbs (1A10H7, 1B3B9, 1G7C2) was transiently expressed in HEK293T cell. All three clones of the expressed recombinant IgG (rIgG) showed the same binding and neutralizing activity as same as those from hybridomas.

Here, we describe how SRSF7 maintains its protein homeostasis in murine P19 cells using an intricate negative feedback mechanism. SRSF7 binding to its premessenger RNA promotes inclusion of a poison cassette exon and transcript degradation via nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). However, elevated SRSF7 levels inhibit NMD and promote translation of two protein halves, termed Split-ORFs, from the bicistronic SRSF7-PCE transcript. The first half acts as dominant-negative isoform suppressing poison cassette exon inclusion and instead promoting the retention of flanking introns containing repeated SRSF7 binding sites. Massive SRSF7 binding to these sites and its oligomerization promote the assembly of large nuclear bodies, which sequester SRSF7 transcripts at their transcription site, preventing their export and restoring normal SRSF7 protein levels. We further show that hundreds of human and mouse NMD targets, especially RNA-binding proteins, encode potential Split-ORFs, some of which are expressed under specific cellular conditions.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"K\u00F6nigs, Vanessa; de Oliveira Freitas Machado, Camila; Arnold, Benjamin; Bl\u00FCmel, Nicole; Solovyeva, Anfisa; L\u00F6bbert, Sinah; Schafranek, Michal; Ruiz De Los Mozos, Igor; Wittig, Ilka; McNicoll, Francois; Schulz, Marcel H.; M\u00FCller-McNicoll, Michaela","journal":"Nat Struct Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47a14293c2dedaef4d47052573868fdc2cf4d447.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096898.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-020-0385-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123389/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","NMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Massive SRSF7 binding","SRSF7 transcripts","repeated SRSF7 binding sites","normal SRSF7 protein levels","elevated SRSF7 levels","essential RNA-binding protein","bicistronic SRSF7-PCE transcript","RNA-binding proteins","protein halves","protein homeostasis","poison cassette exon inclusion","premessenger RNA","mouse NMD targets","termed Split-ORFs","potential Split-ORFs","transcript degradation","dominant-negative isoform","intricate negative feedback mechanism","murine P19 cells","export","retention of flanking introns","translation","nonsense-mediated decay","assembly of large nuclear bodies","oligomerization","misexpression","half acts","hundreds of human","transcription site","cancer","specific cellular conditions"],"language":"en"},

Despite the importance of ND to the poultry industry, little is known about PMV1 strain emergence events and the subsequent dispersal and evolution of new strains. The genotype VI-PMV1 was first identified in the 1980s and has been named pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV1) because of unusual host specificity with Columbiformes (Collins et al., 1996); it has been responsible for panzootics in both chickens and pigeons during that time. Here, we used evolutionary analyses to characterize the emergence of this contemporary PMV1 lineage. We demonstrate that GVI-PMV1 arose through cross-species transmission events from Galliformes (i.e. chicken) to Columbiformes, and quickly established in pigeon populations. Our studies revealed a close association between the time of viral emergence and panzootic events of this virus. The virus appeared first in Southeastern Europe and quickly spread across the European continent, which became the epicenter for global virus dissemination. With new viral gene sequences, we show that GVI-PMV1 viruses currently circulating in North America resulted from multiple invasion events from Europe, one associated with an exotic European Columbiformes species, and that extant lineages have diversified locally. This study extends our understanding of successful viral emergence subsequent to cross-species transmission and dispersal patterns of newly emerged avian viruses, which may improve surveillance awareness and disease control of this and other important avian pathogens.","publish_time":"2013-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chong, Yee Ling; Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Kim, Oekyung; Lu, Huaguang; Dunn, Patty; Poss, Mary","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a95c035b57ab604840a84a23ec7ba8f42b7b25d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106292.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.04.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23628639/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813001743; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134813001743","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","ND"],"locations":["Southeastern Europe","Europe","North America"],"keyphrases":["PMV1 strain emergence events","GVI-PMV1 viruses","time of viral emergence","series of strain emergence events","cross-species transmission events","panzootic events","contemporary PMV1 lineage","understanding of successful viral emergence subsequent","multiple invasion events","emerged avian viruses","exotic European Columbiformes species","subsequent dispersal","pigeon paramyxovirus","evolutionary history of avian paramyxovirus serotype","new viral gene sequences","important avian pathogens","global virus dissemination","dispersal patterns","disease control","importance of ND","European continent","Southeastern Europe","evolutionary analyses","pigeon populations","evolution of new strains","agents of Newcastle disease","North America","Galliformes","unusual host specificity","PPMV1","epicenter","surveillance awareness","close association","chickens","Collins","poultry industry","extant lineages","panzootics","pigeons","study","family","studies","genotype"],"language":"en"},

To provide more insight into the prevalence of HAstV gastroenteritis in China, 664 fecal samples were collected from children affected with acute gastroenteritis in Beijing from March 2005 to November 2007. The samples were analyzed genetically. All eight serotypes (genotypes) of HAstVs were screened using RT\u2010PCR assays targeting the ORF2 region in the study.

Many bacterial protein toxins interact specifically with proteins and/or other membrane components at the surface of target cells. Binding enables access to the appropriate cellular compartment so that the knowledge of the receptor allows essential insight into the mechanism of these toxins. Unlike other bacterial protein toxins (such as the clostridial C1 and C2 toxins from C. botulinum), C3 exoenzyme is devoid of a binding and translocation domain, with which toxins usually initiate receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by access to the intact cell. To date, no specific mechanism for internalization of C3 exoenzyme has been identified. Recently, vimentin was identified as membranous C3-binding partner involved in binding and uptake of C3. Although vimentin is not detected in neurons, vimentin is re-expressed after damage in regenerating neurons. Reappearance of vimentin allows C3 to get access to lesioned neurons/axons to exhibit axonotrophic and dentritotrophic effects.","publish_time":"2016-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rohrbeck, Astrid; Just, Ingo","journal":"Uptake and Trafficking of Protein Toxins","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/862771f65aca712e95a0f1b7768afd123578fe93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122702.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832378/; https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2016_44","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prototype of C3","uptake of C3","membranous C3-binding partner","internalization of C3 exoenzyme","Clostridium botulinum C3","access","C2 toxins","bacterial protein toxins","lesioned neurons","regenerating neurons","Reappearance of vimentin","small GTP-binding proteins RhoA","ADP-ribosylate","specific mechanism","ADP-ribosyltransferases","appropriate cellular compartment","cellular Rho functions","receptor-mediated endocytosis","knowledge","axons","axonotrophic","transferase-independent activity","clostridial C1","membrane components","essential insight","C3bot","pharmacological tool","dendritic growth","damage","translocation domain","surface of target cells","dentritotrophic effects","branching","date","intact cell","addition","pathways"],"language":"en"},

Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation.

However, interpretation of the results of serologic studies has been hampered by the diversity of approaches and the lack of standardized methods and reporting. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the CONSISE ROSES \u2010I statement was to improve the quality and transparency of reporting of influenza seroepidemiologic studies and facilitate the assessment of the validity and generalizability of published results. METHODS: The ROSES\u2010I statement was developed as an expert consensus of the CONSISE epidemiology and laboratory working groups. The recommendations are presented in the familiar format of a reporting guideline. Because seroepidemiologic studies are a specific type of observational epidemiology study, the ROSES\u2010I statement is built upon the STROBE guidelines. As such, the ROSES\u2010I statement should be seen as an extension of the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: The ROSES \u2010I statement presents 42 items that can be used as a checklist of the information that should be included in the results of published seroepidemiologic studies, and which can also serve as a guide to the items that need to be considered during study design and implementation.

The results of previous transmission studies suggested that the aetiological agent of WPD is most likely a virus. However, the identity of the presumed viral agent had not been elucidated. In the current report, we describe identification of a novel virus from tissues of WPD-affected possums using a combination of next generation sequencing and traditional molecular methods. The proportion of possums positive for the novel virus by PCR was significantly higher (p \u003C0.0001) among animals with WPD than clinically healthy possums, strongly suggesting an aetiological involvement of the virus in WPD. Analysis of the partial genomic sequence of the putative WPD virus indicated that it is a novel nidovirus, most closely related to the current members of the family Arteriviridae.","publish_time":"2012-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dunowska, M.; Biggs, P.

Three trans-membrane non-structural proteins, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6, are understood to be membrane anchors of the coronavirus replication complex. Nsp4 is localized to the ER membrane when expressed alone but is recruited into the replication complex in infected cells. It is revealed to contain four trans-membrane regions and its N- and C-termini are exposed to the cytosol. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have determined the crystal structures of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of nsp4 (nsp4C) from MHV strain A59 and a C425S site-directed mutant. The highly conserved 89 amino acid region from T408 to Q496 is shown to possess a new fold. The wild-type (WT) structure features two monomers linked by a Cys425-Cys425 disulfide bond in one asymmetric unit. The monomers are arranged with their N- and C-termini in opposite orientations to form an \u201Copen\u201D conformation. Mutation of Cys425 to Ser did not affect the monomer structure, although the mutant dimer adopts strikingly different conformations by crystal packing, with the cross-linked C-termini and parallel N-termini of two monomers forming a \u201Cclosed\u201D conformation. The WT nsp4C exists as a dimer in solution and can dissociate easily into monomers in a reducing environment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As nsp4C is exposed in the reducing cytosol, the monomer of nsp4C should be physiological.

Currently, no specific prophylactic and therapeutic treatment is available. No evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that a treatment may ameliorate the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 exists with the only exception of preliminary evidence from remdesivir trials. Here, we present evidence from the literature and a compelling hypothesis on the potential immunomodulatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant effects of iron chelators in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. Interestingly, iron chelation has been shown in vitro to suppress endothelial inflammation in viral infection, which is the main pathophysiologic mechanism behind systemic organ involvement induced by SARS-CoV-2, by inhibiting IL-6 synthesis through decreasing NF-kB. Iron chelators exhibit iron chelating, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, particularly against RNA viruses. These agents could attenuate ARDS and help control SARS-CoV-2 via multiple mechanisms including: 1) inhibition of viral replication; 2) decrease of iron availability; 3) upregulation of B cells; 4) improvement of the neutralizing anti-viral antibody titer; 5) inhibition of endothelial inflammation and 6) prevention of pulmonary fibrosis and lung decline via reduction of pulmonary iron accumulation. Both retrospective analyses of data in electronic health records, as well as proof of concept studies in humans and large RCTs are needed to fully elucidate the efficacy and safety of iron chelating agents in the therapeutic armamentarium of COVID-19, probably as an adjunctive treatment.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dalamaga, Maria; Karampela, Irene; Mantzoros, Christos S.","journal":"Metabolism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b5043e575892398558c0394c9f8b4fadb6cbf68.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7207125.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154260; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026049520301244; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049520301244?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418885/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["iron availability","iron chelation","Iron chelators exhibit iron chelating","treatment of COVID","safety of iron chelating agents","anti-oxidant effects of iron chelators","reduction of pulmonary iron accumulation","SARS-CoV","therapeutic treatment","pandemic of COVID","adjunctive treatment","therapeutic armamentarium of COVID","immunomodulatory effects","viral infection","inhibition of viral replication","inhibition of endothelial inflammation","present evidence","randomized clinical trials","exception of preliminary evidence","neutralizing anti-viral antibody titer","large RCTs","remdesivir trials","global health","prevention of pulmonary fibrosis","electronic health records","clinical outcome of patients","lung decline","systemic organ involvement","main pathophysiologic mechanism","improvement","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","proof of concept studies","humans","compelling hypothesis","retrospective analyses of data","literature","specific prophylactic","ARDS","help","efficacy","upregulation of B cells","significant threat","multiple mechanisms","synthesis","decreasing NF","RNA viruses","complications"],"language":"en"},

The first step was to determine progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin using HPLC-UV, and then determine the R-goitrin and S-goitrin by coupling with CD detection. Subsequently, through the linear relations between anisotropy factor (g factor) and the percent optical purity of R-goitrin, the contents of R-goitrin and S-goitrin from the R,S-goitrin mixture were calculated separately. Furthermore, the chemical composition features of the four chiral glucosinolates in 37 samples from crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis were conducted. The total content of the four glucosinolates was obviously higher in crude drugs, and the variance character of each glucosinolate contents was different.

It is characterized by a myriad of neuropsychiatric manifestations including mild neurological deficit to severe encephalopathy. PMNS was first described in 1996 and since then there have been 48 cases reported in the English literature. We report another case of PMNS in a 24-year-old healthy male and present a review of the disease entity. METHOD: We searched PMNS-related journal articles and case reports in the English literature, using PubMed and Google search engines. A total of forty-nine cases meeting the diagnostic criteria of PMNS were selected in this review. CONCLUSION: PMNS is a rare complication of severe malaria that might be underreported. It can develop up to 2 months after clearance of parasitemia. Clinical features can be variable. Most cases are self-limited, but more severe cases may benefit from steroid therapy.","publish_time":"2019-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yadava, Sanjay K.; Laleker, Ashley; Fazili, Tasaduq","journal":"Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a492f01adf175716a189fe572c5a93eb17e6fa44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100559.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666615/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-019-01267-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMNS","Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of PMNS","severe cases","rare complication of severe malaria","severe falciparum malaria","diagnostic criteria of PMNS","severe encephalopathy","Post-malaria neurological syndrome","PMNS-related journal articles","rare self-limiting neurological complication","English literature","review","mild neurological deficit","case reports","PubMed","myriad of neuropsychiatric manifestations","recovery","Google search engines","BACKGROUND","year-old healthy male","steroid therapy","CONCLUSION","months","clearance of parasitemia","Clinical features","disease entity","total","METHOD"],"language":"en"},

Tripterygium hypoglaucum (level) Hutch (Celastraceae) is a traditional Chinese medicine plant with many pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammation, anti-tumor and antifertility. The usual medicinal part is the roots which contain about a 1% yield of alkaloids. A crude total alkaloids extract was prepared from the roots of T. hypoglaucum amd its antiviral activity against HSV-1 in Vero cells was evaluated by cytopathic effect (CPE) assay, plaque reduction assay and by RT-PCR analysis. The alkaloids extract presented low cytotoxicity (CC(50) = 46.6 \u03BCg/mL) and potent CPE inhibition activity, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) was 6.5 \u03BCg/mL, noticeably lower than that of Acyclovir (15.4 \u03BCg /mL). Plaque formation was significantly reduced by the alkaloids extract at concentrations of 6.25 \u03BCg/mL to 12.5 \u03BCg/mL, the plaque reduction ratio reached 55% to 75 which was 35% higher than that of Acyclovir at the same concentration. RT-PCR analysis showed that, the transcription of two important delayed early genes UL30 and UL39, and a late gene US6 of HSV-1 genome all were suppressed by the alkaloids extract, the expression inhibiting efficacy compared to the control was 74.6% (UL30), 70.9% (UL39) and 62.6% (US6) respectively at the working concentration of 12.5\u03BCg/mL.

In this study, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on stroke care across China. Methods- Data from the Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China consisting of 280 hospitals across China demonstrated a significant drop in the number of cases of thrombolysis and thrombectomy. We designed a survey to investigate the major changes during the COVID-19 outbreak and potential causes of these changes. The survey was distributed to the leaders of stroke centers in these 280 hospitals. Results- From the data of Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China, the total number of thrombolysis and thrombectomy cases dropped 26.7% (P\u003C0.0001) and 25.3% (P\u003C0.0001), respectively, in February 2020 as compared with February 2019. We retrieved 227 valid complete datasets from the 280 stroke centers. Nearly 50% of these hospitals were designated hospitals for COVID-19. The capacity for stroke care was reduced in the majority of the hospitals. Most of the stroke centers stopped or reduced their efforts in stroke education for the public. Hospital admissions related to stroke dropped \u224840%; thrombolysis and thrombectomy cases dropped \u224825%, which is similar to the results from the Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China as compared with the same period in 2019. Many factors contributed to the reduced admissions and prehospital delays; lack of stroke knowledge and proper transportation were significant limiting factors. Patients not coming to the hospital for fear of virus infection was also a likely key factor. Conclusions- The COVID-19 outbreak impacted stroke care significantly in China, including prehospital and in-hospital care, resulting in a significant drop in admissions, thrombolysis, and thrombectomy. Although many factors contributed, patients not coming to the hospital was probably the major limiting factor.

Here we explored the possibilities for rationally attenuating IBV to improve our knowledge regarding the function of IBV accessory proteins and for the development of next-generation vaccines with the recently established reverse genetic system for IBV H52 based on targeted RNA recombination and selection of recombinant viruses in embryonated eggs. To this aim, we selectively removed accessory genes 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b individually, and rescued the resulting recombinant (r) rIBV-\u03943a, rIBV-\u03943b, rIBV-\u03945a and rIBV-\u03945b. In vitro inoculation of chicken embryo kidney cells with recombinant and wild-type viruses demonstrated that the accessory protein 5b is involved in the delayed activation of the interferon response of the host after IBV infection. Embryo mortality after the inoculation of 8-day-old embryonated chicken eggs with recombinant and wild-type viruses showed that rIBV-\u03943b, rIBV-\u03945a and rIBV-\u03945b had an attenuated phenotype in ovo, with reduced titres at 6 h p.i. and 12 h p.i. for all viruses, while growing to the same titre as wild-type rIBV at 48 h p.i. When administered to 1-day-old chickens, rIBV-\u03943a, rIBV-\u03943b, rIBV-\u03945a and rIBV-\u03945b showed reduced ciliostasis in comparison to the wild-type viruses.

However, convalescent serology is often not collected. We used multiple imputation to assign values for missing serology results to estimate virus-specific prevalence among pediatric and adult community-acquired pneumonia hospitalizations using data from an active population-based surveillance study. METHODS: Presence of adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133, and respiratory syncytial virus was defined by positive PCR on nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens or a 4-fold rise in paired serology. We performed multiple imputation by developing a multivariable regression model for each virus using data from patients with available serology results. We calculated absolute and relative differences in the proportion of each virus detected comparing the imputed to observed (nonimputed) results. RESULTS: Among 2222 children and 2259 adults, 98.8% and 99.5% had nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens and 43.2% and 37.5% had paired serum specimens, respectively. Imputed results increased viral etiology assignments by an absolute difference of 1.6%\u20134.4% and 0.8%\u20132.8% in children and adults, respectively; relative differences were 1.1\u20133.0 times higher.

The confrontation of these different but complementary points of view will thus enrich the interdisciplinary management of eventual future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2007-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cibrelus, L.; N\u00F6el, V.; Emmanuelli, J.; Breton, G.; Longuet, P.; Rigolli, B.; Leport, C.; Vild\u00E9, J.-L.","journal":"Med Mal Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37884169b35a73c26c6a20fc0e173590bee8dc8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119067.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X07002867; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X07002867","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","French National Institute for Health"],"locations":["Paris"],"keyphrases":["cases of SARS","characteristics of patients","clinical teams","suspected SARS","clinical data","probable case of SARS","official definition","initial assessment","risk assessment","final assessment","epidemic diffusion","Paris hospital","interdisciplinary management of eventual future outbreaks","epidemic emerging disease","exposure","hypothetic differences","complementary points of view","additional level of suspicion","French National Institute","impact","Health","confrontation","experience","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","STUDY DESIGN","OBJECTIVE","elements","clinicians","households","epidemiologists"],"language":"en"},

The search results are organized as a temporal event map (TEM) that serves as the whole picture about an event\u2019s evolution or development by showing the dependence relationships among events. Based on the event relationships in the TEM, we further propose a method to measure the degrees of importance of events, so as to discover the important component events for a query, as well as the several algebraic operators involved in the TEM, that allow users to view the target event. Experiments conducted on a real data set show that our method outperforms the baseline method Event Evolution Graph (EEG), and it can help discover certain new relationships missed by previous methods and even by human annotators.","publish_time":"2019-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Yi; Xie, Haoran; Lau, Raymond Y.K.; Li, Qing; Wong, Tak-Lam; Wang, Fu Lee","journal":"Appl Soft Comput","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d34c5f3a5f439702d5c04a9c11b8b5c18d869151.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105191.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494619305319; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494619305319; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288693/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["query event","target event","event reference","kinds of event relationships","temporal event map","problem of temporal event searches","baseline method Event Evolution Graph","framework of event relationship analysis","dependence relationships","search events","important component events","event\u2019s evolution","certain new relationships","picture","content dependence","search results","previous methods","development","EEG","real data set","user queries","Experiments","human annotators","degrees of importance","extent","users","algebraic operators","paper","user\u2019s need"],"language":"en"},

To date, there is only one report of the circulation of kobuvirus in cats in southern China. To investigate the presence and genetic variability of FeKoV in northeast China, 197 fecal samples were collected from 105 cats with obvious diarrhea and 92 asymptomatic cats in Shenyang, Jinzhou, Changchun, Jilin and Harbin regions, Northeast China, and viruses were detected by RT-PCR with universal primers targeting all kobuviruses. Kobuvirus was identified in 28 fecal samples with an overall prevalence of 14.2% (28/197) of which 20 samples were co-infected with feline parvovirus (FPV) and/or feline bocavirus (FBoV). Diarrhoeic cats had a higher kobuvirus prevalence (19.1%, 20/105) than asymptomatic cats (8.7%, 8/92). By genetic analysis based on partial 3D gene, all kobuvirus-positive samples were more closely related to previous FeKoV strains with high identities of 90.5%\u201397.8% and 96.6%\u2013100% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis based on the complete VP1 gene indicated that all FeKoV strains identified in this study were placed into a cluster, which separated from other reference strains previously reported, and three identical amino acid substitutions were present at the C-terminal of the VP1 protein for these FeKoV strains. Furthermore, two complete FeKoV polyprotein genomes were successfully obtained from two positive samples and designated 16JZ0605 and 17CC0811, respectively. The two strains shared 92.9%\u201394.9% nucleotide identities and 96.8%\u201398.4% amino acid identities to FeKoV prototype strains. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that FeKoVs were clustered according to their geographical regions, albeit with limited sequences support. This study provides the first molecular evidence that FeKoV circulates in cats in northeast China, and these FeKoVs exhibit genetic diversity and unique evolutionary trend.","publish_time":"2018-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niu, Ting-Jiang; Yi, Shuai-Shu; Wang, Xin; Wang, Lei-Hua; Guo, Bing-Yan; Zhao, Li-Yan; Zhang, Shuang; Dong, Hao; Wang, Kai; Hu, Xue-Gui","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/618dc6f68e1634ddb8d04360a157532372455da4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185515.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818309547; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818309547; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.12.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","southern China","Jilin","Northeast China"],"keyphrases":["previous FeKoV strains","FeKoV prototype strains","asymptomatic cats","Feline kobuvirus","kobuvirus-positive samples","genetic variability of FeKoV","Diarrhoeic cats","feces of cats","northeast China","fecal samples","circulation of kobuvirus","genus kobuvirus","reference strains","complete FeKoV polyprotein genomes","amino acid identities","higher kobuvirus prevalence","southern China","phylogenetic analysis","nucleotide identities","amino acid levels","complete VP1 gene","genetic diversity","FeKoVs","identical amino acid substitutions","feline parvovirus","high identities","feline bocavirus","study","D gene","Harbin regions","VP1 protein","geographical regions","obvious diarrhea","overall prevalence","Jilin","FPV","Jinzhou","Changchun","Shenyang","C-terminal","unique evolutionary trend","RT-PCR","novel picornavirus","universal primers","designated 16JZ0605","17CC0811","molecular evidence","limited sequences support","South Korea","kobuviruses","report","presence","cluster","FBoV","date"],"language":"en"},

Genetic distances among individuals on the basis of 1,130 base pairs of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) locus were estimated from specimens collected from 17 sites on Madagascar, 3 sites on Grande Comore, 3 sites on Anjouan, and 2 sites on Moh\u00E9li. We observed little variation in Madagascar and nearshore island samples (maximum 1.1%) and interisland Comoros samples (maximum 1.8%). In contrast, pairwise distances between different sampled sites on Madagascar and the Comoros varied from 8.5% to 13.2%. For 131 Malagasy animals, 69 unique haplotypes were recovered with 86 variable sites, and for 44 Comorian individuals, 17 unique haplotypes were found with 30 variable sites. No haplotype was shared between Madagascar and the Comoros, adding to previous morphological evidence that these 2 populations should be considered separate species. Cytb data showed that Rousettus populations of Madagascar (including nearshore islands) and the Comoros are respectively monophyletic and display no geographic structure in haplotype diversity, and that R. madagascariensis and R. obliviosus are strongly supported as sister to each other relative to other Rousettus species. Genotypic data from 6 microsatellite loci confirm lack of geographic structure in either of the 2 species. In pairwise tests of population differentiation, the only significant values were between samples from the Comoro Islands and Madagascar (including nearshore islands). Estimates of current and historical demographic parameters support population expansion in both the Comoros and Madagascar. These data suggest a more recent and rapid demographic expansion in Madagascar in comparison with greater population stability on the Comoros. On the basis of available evidence, open-water crossings approaching 300 km seem rarely traversed by Rousettus, and, if successful, can result in genetic isolation and subsequent differentiation.","publish_time":"2010-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodman, Steven M.; Chan, Lauren M.; Nowak, Michael D.; Yoder, Anne D.","journal":"J Mammal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a00172c6b1c1f242b76cc74382382f7cb8a2d995.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108659.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287379/; https://doi.org/10.1644/09-mamm-a-283.1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Madagascar"],"keyphrases":["Rousettus populations of Madagascar","variable sites","interisland Comoros samples","Rousettus species","nearshore islands","different sampled sites","Rousettus madagascariensis","population differentiation","Genetic distances","Cytb data","nearshore island samples","Grande Comore","unique haplotypes","Anjouan","patterns of genetic variation","Comoro Islands","genetic isolation","obliviosus","Genotypic data","Moh\u00E9li","separate species","rapid demographic expansion","historical demographic parameters support population expansion","greater population stability","basis of available evidence","lack of geographic structure","little variation","Comorian individuals","subsequent differentiation","haplotype diversity","previous morphological evidence","comparison","mitochondrial cytochrome b","microsatellite loci","base pairs","locus","Estimates of current","significant values","open-water crossings","specimens","contrast","Malagasy animals","sister"],"language":"en"},

Macrophages are a population of innate immune cells that sense and respond to microbial threats by producing inflammatory molecules that eliminate pathogens and promote tissue repair. However, a dysregulated macrophage response can be damaging to the host, as is seen in the macrophage activation syndrome induced by severe infections, including in infections with the related virus SARS-CoV.

Abstract Emergent viral infections are defined as those the incidence of which has increased over the last 20 years. These infections concern human but also animal viruses affecting wild or tame animals. In human, emergent viruses are of zoonotic origin and often due to crossing of species barrier. This inter-species crossing is promoted by various circumstances: environmental and climatic variations, bioterrorism, evolutive potential of the virus, etc. Screening for the animal reservoir is extremely important to prevent re-emergence and to eradicate the disease. The emergential success of some viruses has had serious consequences on human public health: flu pandemics, AIDS pandemic, hemorrhagic fever, and more recently SARS.","publish_time":"2004-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vabret, A.","journal":"M\u00E9decine et Maladies Infectieuses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54f442e51d7192f2930c191ff02e70c9fc870012.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126275.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X04001817; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X04001817","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the virus","to eradicate the disease","increased over the","The emergential success","to crossing","emergent viruses","infections virales \u00E9mergentes","defined as those the incidence","the animal reservoir is extremely important to prevent re","some viruses","In human","Abstract Emergent viral infections","homme","These infections concern human but also animal viruses affecting wild","species crossing is promoted","human public health","recherche du r\u00E9servoir animal","climatic variations","variations environnementales","species barrier","\u00E9mergences virales","emergence","had serious consequences","flu pandemics","various circumstances","which","Screening","hemorrhagic fever","sant\u00E9 publique humaine","pand\u00E9mies grippales","AIDS pandemic","environmental","often","eu des cons\u00E9quences graves","nombreuses circonstances","evolutive potential","zoonotic origin","pand\u00E9mie de sida","bioterrorisme","potentiel \u00E9volutif","tame animals","capitale","This inter","syndrome de d\u00E9tresse respiratoire aigu","fi\u00E8vres h\u00E9morragiques","more recently SARS","SRAS","pr\u00E9vention des r\u00E9\u00E9mergences","viroses animales","celles","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","passage interesp\u00E8ces","origine zoonotique","franchissement de barri\u00E8re"],"language":"fr"},

CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells are essential to control infectious virus but at the cost of tissue damage. An enigma in understanding the contribution of T cell subsets in pathogenesis resides in their distinct migration pattern across the BBB (blood brain barrier). CD4(\u002B) T cells transiently accumulate within the perivascular space, whereas CD8(\u002B) T cells migrate directly into the CNS parenchyma. As MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) facilitate migration across the glia limitans, specific expression of the TIMP (tissue inhibitor of MMPs)-1 by CD4(\u002B) T cells present in the perivascular cuffs suggested that TIMP-1 is responsible for stalling CD4(\u002B) T cell migration into the CNS parenchyma. Using TIMP-1 deficient mice, the present data demonstrate an increase rather than a decrease in CD4(\u002B) T cell accumulation within the perivascular space during JHMV infection. Whereas virus control was not affected by perivascular retention of CD4(\u002B) T cells, disease severity was decreased and associated with reduced IFN\u03B3 (interferon \u03B3) production. Moreover, decreased CD4(\u002B) T cell recruitment into the CNS parenchyma of TIMP-1 deficient mice was not associated with impaired T cell recruiting chemokines or MMP expression, and no compensation by other TIMP molecules was identified. These data suggest an MMP-independent role of TIMP-1 in regulating CD4(\u002B) T cell access into the CNS parenchyma during acute JHMV encephalitis.","publish_time":"2013-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savarin, Carine; Bergmann, Cornelia C.; Hinton, David R.; Stohlman, Stephen A.","journal":"ASN Neuro","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fb5556c3b5fdb3bff762a42f16c21a7fa65d801.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3840398.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1042/an20130033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24156369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","TIMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","T cell migration","impaired T cell","T cell access","T cell accumulation","T cell recruitment","CNS parenchyma of TIMP","decreased CD4","contribution of T cell subsets","stalling CD4","perivascular retention of CD4","TIMP molecules","perivascular space","perivascular cuffs","MMP-independent role of TIMP","JHMV infection","MMP expression","deficient mice","CD8","present data","virus control","distinct migration pattern","acute JHMV encephalitis","tissue inhibitor of MMPs","specific expression","infectious virus","cost of tissue damage","pathogenesis","BBB","central nervous system","sublethal neurotropic coronavirus","glia limitans","chemokines","reduced IFN\u03B3","interferon \u03B3","production","blood brain barrier","compensation","increase","matrix metalloproteinases","disease severity","vigorous inflammatory response","enigma"],"language":"en"},

As a key enzyme in the viral life-cycle, the main protease (Mpro) is most attractive for drug design targeting the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. In this study, SARS-CoV Mpro was used to specifically remove the GST tag in a new fusion protein expression system. We report a new method to produce wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV Mpro with authentic N and C termini, and compare the activity of WT protease with those of three different types of SARS-CoV Mpro with additional residues at the N or C terminus. Our results show that additional residues at the N terminus, but not at the C terminus, of Mpro are detrimental to enzyme activity. To explain this, the crystal structures of WT SARS-CoV Mpro and its complex with a Michael acceptor inhibitor were determined to 1.6 \u00C5 and 1.95 \u00C5 resolution respectively. These crystal structures reveal that the first residue of this protease is important for sustaining the substrate-binding pocket and inhibitor binding. This study suggests that SARS-CoV Mpro could serve as a new tag-cleavage endopeptidase for protein overproduction, and the WT SARS-CoV Mpro is more appropriate for mechanistic characterization and inhibitor design.","publish_time":"2007-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xue, Xiaoyu; Yang, Haitao; Shen, Wei; Zhao, Qi; Li, Jun; Yang, Kailin; Chen, Cheng; Jin, Yinghua; Bartlam, Mark; Rao, Zihe","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31f77aa2bb95af8140123e95400b3531a05d0180.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094453.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283606016329; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283606016329","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Michael"],"organizations":["SARS","GST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["crystal structures of WT SARS-CoV Mpro","SARS coronavirus","different types of SARS","activity of WT protease","C terminus","N terminus","inhibitor binding","inhibitor design","new fusion protein expression system","fusion protein expression systems","fusion tags","protein overproduction","additional residues","authentic N","C termini","new method","main protease","enzyme activity","study","new tag-cleavage endopeptidase","Michael acceptor inhibitor","GST tag","drug design","key enzyme","\u00C5 resolution","viral proteases","substrate-binding pocket","viral life-cycle","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","complex","mechanistic characterization","etiological agent responsible","wild-type","results"],"language":"en"},

Here we report and characterize the in vitro anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity of several semi-synthetic derivatives of teicoplanin aglycone. METHODS: Anti-HCV activity was analysed in: (i) three different subgenomic HCV replicon systems using a luciferase or quantitative RT\u2013PCR (qRT\u2013PCR) assay; and (ii) an infectious HCV cell culture system by means of qRT\u2013PCR and immunofluorescence assays. RESULTS: Several teicoplanin aglycone derivatives elicited selective anti-HCV activity in replicons as well as infectious cell culture systems, with LCTA-949 being the most potent derivative. LCTA-949 proved, in contrast to several directly acting antivirals for HCV, efficient in clearing cells of their replicons. When LCTA-949 was combined with HCV protease or polymerase inhibitors an overall additive effect was observed. Likewise, LCTA-949 was equipotent against wild-type replicons as well as against replicons resistant to polymerase and protease inhibitors. Following up to 4 months of selective pressure, no drug-resistant replicons were selected. When combined with the HCV NS3 protease inhibitor VX-950, LCTA-949 prevented the development of VX-950-resistant variants. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-synthetic derivatives of teicoplanin aglycone constitute a novel class of HCV replication inhibitors that are not cross-resistant with various HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors and in particular are potent in clearing hepatoma cells of their replicons. This class of molecules also provides a good tool to obtain novel insights into the replication cycle of HCV and into cellular factors/processes that are crucial for viral replication.","publish_time":"2011-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Obeid, Susan; Printsevskaya, Svetlana S.; Olsufyeva, Eugenia N.; Dallmeier, Kai; Durantel, David; Zoulim, Fabien; Preobrazhenskaya, Maria N.; Neyts, Johan; Paeshuyse, Jan","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb81b141b38997db5593cc34edd59532da6faad2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109641.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkr104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21436155/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various HCV protease","replication cycle of HCV","selective anti-HCV activity","replicons resistant","LCTA","novel class of HCV replication inhibitors","protease inhibitors","HCV NS3 protease inhibitor VX","drug-resistant replicons","infectious HCV cell culture system","polymerase inhibitors","teicoplanin aglycone derivatives","semi-synthetic derivatives of teicoplanin aglycone","different subgenomic HCV replicon systems","PCR","wild-type replicons","cross-resistant","antiviral activity","resistant variants","semi-synthetic derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics","qRT","infectious cell culture systems","clearing cells","viral replication","clearing hepatoma cells","novel insights","anti-hepatitis C virus","class of molecules","development of VX","potent derivative","months of selective pressure","luciferase","quantitative RT","processes","cellular factors","overall additive effect","good tool","antivirals","CONCLUSIONS","HIV","coronaviruses","immunofluorescence assays","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","METHODS","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Vaccines have reduced the incidence of JE in some countries, but no specific antiviral therapy is currently available. The NS3 protein of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a multifunctional protein combining protease, helicase and nucleoside 5\u2032-triphosphatase (NTPase) activities. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of this protein has recently been solved using a roentgenographic method. This enabled structure-based virtual screening for novel inhibitors of JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase. The aim of the present research was to identify novel potent medicinal substances for the treatment of JE. In the first step of studies, the natural ligand ATP and two known JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase inhibitors were docked to their molecular target. The refined structure of the enzyme was used to construct a pharmacophore model for JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase inhibitors. The freely available ZINC database of lead-like compounds was then screened for novel inhibitors. About 1 161 000 compounds have been screened and 15 derivatives of the highest scores have been selected. These compounds were docked to the JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase to examine their binding mode and verify screening results by consensus scoring procedure.","publish_time":"2010-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaczor, Agnieszka; Matosiuk, Dariusz","journal":"FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/722b25b1a7e3ce9dad1d1684dd027df03a28b7a9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/933dd2c628f2113aa3b854a74ed51e6c4a516eaf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110324.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19863664/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695x.2009.00619.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JEV","ATP"],"locations":["Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["NTPase inhibitors","novel inhibitors of JEV NS3 helicase","known JEV NS3 helicase","compounds","NS3 protein of Japanese encephalitis virus","multifunctional protein","treatment of JE","incidence of JE","crystal structure","enabled structure","refined structure","virtual screening","screening results","novel potent medicinal substances","available ZINC database of lead","natural ligand ATP","mortality","significant cause of human morbidity","countries","binding mode","nucleoside","pharmacophore model","present research","Asia","specific antiviral therapy","consensus","catalytic domain","protease","triphosphatase","step of studies","Africa","procedure","derivatives","enzyme","molecular target","highest scores","aim","Vaccines","activities","roentgenographic method"],"language":"en"},

The frequency of emerging and reemerging infections and the risk of bioterrorism warrant significant efforts towards the development of prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures. Vaccines are the mainstay of infectious disease prophylaxis. Traditional vaccines, however, are failing to satisfy the global demand because of limited scalability of production systems, long production timelines and product safety concerns. Subunit vaccines are a highly promising alternative to traditional vaccines. Subunit vaccines, as well as monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutic proteins, can be produced in heterologous expression systems based on bacteria, yeast, insect cells or mammalian cells, in shorter times and at higher quantities, and are efficacious and safe. However, current recombinant systems have certain limitations associated with production capacity and cost. Plants are emerging as a promising platform for recombinant protein production due to time and cost efficiency, scalability, lack of harboured mammalian pathogens and possession of the machinery for eukaryotic post\u2010translational protein modification. So far, a variety of subunit vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and therapeutic proteins (antivirals) have been produced in plants as candidate countermeasures against emerging, reemerging and bioterrorism\u2010related infections. Many of these have been extensively evaluated in animal models and some have shown safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials.

During the period of 1990 and 2000, three more tissue banks were set up, i.e., Biomaterial Centre in Surabaya, Jamil Tissue Bank in Padang, and Sitanala Tissue Bank in Tangerang. In 1994, BRTB produced bone allografts. The banks established under the IAEA program concentrated its work on the production of amnion, bone and soft tissues allografts, as well as bone xenografts. These tissues (allografts and xenografts) were sterilised using gamma irradiation (about 90%) and the rest were sterilized by ETO and those products have been used in the treatment of patients at more than 50 hospitals in Indonesia. In 2004, those tissue banks produced 8,500 grafts and 5,000 of them were amnion grafts for eye treatment and wound dressing. All of those grafts were used for patients as well as for research. In 2006, the production increased to 9,000 grafts. Although the capacity of those banks can produce more grafts, we are facing problems on getting raw materials from suitable donors. To fulfill the demand of bone grafts we also produced bone xenografts. The impact of the IAEA program in tissue banking activities in Indonesia can be summarised as follows: to support the national program on importing substitutes for medical devices. The price of imported tissues are between US$ 50 and US$ 6,000 per graft. Local tissue bank can produce tissues with the same quality with the price for about 10\u201330% of the imported tissues.","publish_time":"2008-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hilmy, Nazly; Manjas, Menkher; Ferdiansyah; Abbas, Basril; Morales Pedraza, Jorge","journal":"Cell Tissue Bank","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5afc5b9c205d19b702969fe99064fbf9a363b09f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088159.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18651245/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10561-008-9088-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Nuclear Energy Agency","Batan Research Tissue Bank/BRTB","Jamil Tissue Bank","Sitanala Tissue Bank","BRTB","IAEA"],"locations":["Jakarta","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["tissue banks","Jamil Tissue Bank","Sitanala Tissue Bank","Local tissue bank","Batan Research Tissue Bank","amnion grafts","bone allografts","bone xenografts","demand of bone grafts","tissue banking activities","soft tissues allografts","price of imported tissues","IAEA program","production of amnion","national program","fresh amnion","US","BRTB","treatment of patients","Indonesia","gamma irradiation","eye treatment","National Nuclear Energy Agency","Padang","lyophilisation","Surabaya","Jakarta","Biomaterial Centre","wound dressing","raw materials","fetal membranes","problems","substitutes","work","setting","suitable donors","medical devices","development","Tangerang","impact","ETO","products","hospitals","quality","rest","capacity","period"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Severity of common cold symptoms of patients from a teaching hospital was assessed by a four-category scale and summed to obtain the total symptom severity score (TSSS). Association between the fusion and glycoprotein genes diversity, viral load (quantified using an improved RT-qPCR assay), and symptom severity were analyzed using bivariate and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Among 81/3706 HMPV-positive patients, there were no significant differences in terms of demographics, number of days elapsed between symptom onset and clinic visit, respiratory symptoms manifestation and severity between different HMPV genotypes/sub-lineages. Surprisingly, elderly patients (\u226565 years old) had lower severity of symptoms (indicated by TSSS) than young and middle age adults (p = 0.008). Nasopharyngeal viral load did not correlate with nor predict symptom severity of HMPV infection. Interestingly, at 3\u20135 days after symptom onset, genotype A-infected patients had higher viral load compared to genotype B (4.4 vs. 3.3 log(10) RNA copies/\u03BCl) (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, HMPV genetic diversity and viral load did not impact symptom severity in adults with acute respiratory tract infections. Differences in viral load dynamics over time between genotypes may have important implications on viral transmission.

In the present study, we evaluated the role of glycyrrhizin on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in the blood and nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis (AR) mice. Mice were divided into six groups: normal control mice, model control (MC) mice, three glycyrrhizin-treated mice groups and lycopene-treated mice. Sensitization-associated increase in lipid peroxidation was observed in the blood and nasal mucosa of MC mice. Activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) and levels of glutathione (GSH) were found to be significantly decreased in the blood and nasal mucosa in MC mice when compared to normal control mice. However, normalized lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defenses were reported in the glycyrrhizin-treated and lycopene-treated mice. Moreover, glycyrrhizin treatment still enhanced IFN-\u03B3 and reduced IL-4 levels in glycyrrhizin-treated mice. These findings demonstrated that glycyrrhizin treatment enhanced the antioxidant status and decreased the incidence of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation and improved immunity activities in the blood and nasal mucosa of AR mice.","publish_time":"2011-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xiao-Lan; Zhou, Ai-Guo; Zhang, Li; Chen, Wei-Jun","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49f01042ee1df642748c8b65f2abde687b2750ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3083680.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms12020905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21541033/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glycyrrhizin-treated mice groups","lycopene-treated mice","nasal mucosa of MC mice","normal control mice","nasal mucosa of AR mice","glycyrrhizin treatment","blood","role of glycyrrhizin","increased lipid peroxidation","normalized lipid peroxidation","antioxidant status","antioxidant defenses","nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis","Activities of antioxidant enzymes","incidence of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation","total antioxidant capacity","model control","levels of glutathione","allergic diseases","GSH-Px","glutathione peroxidase","degenerative diseases","improved immunity activities","enhanced IFN-\u03B3","catalase","SOD","superoxide dismutase","reduced IL","major risk factor","TAOC","antioxidants","Sensitization-associated increase","medicinal properties","Oxidative stress","present study","findings"],"language":"en"},

Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build non-invasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow reducing the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. METHODS: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost \u003C75 US$), with construction details open source provided for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated (and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis-150, Resmed): a) in the bench using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive disease and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing a high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients. RESULTS: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory pressures up to 20/10 cmH(2)O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling both in the bench test and in volunteers. Breathing difficulty score rated (1\u201310 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p\u003C0.005) decreased from 5.45\u00B11.68 without support to 2.83\u00B11.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80\u00B11.48; p=1.000). CONCLUSION: The low-cost, easy-to-build non-invasive ventilator performs similarly as a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garmendia, Onintza; Rodr\u00EDguez-Lazaro, Miguel A.; Otero, Jorge; Phan, Phuong; Stoyanova, Alexandrina; Dinh-Xuan, Anh Tuan; Gozal, David; Navajas, Daniel; Montserrat, Josep M.; Farr\u00E9, Ramon","journal":"Eur Respir J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2588ca2c30d986414276a12522db3f7d21108966.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312862/; https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00846-2020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-invasive ventilator","designed ventilator","prototype ventilator","LMICs","non-invasive bilevel pressure ventilator","restrictive patients","available device","high-quality commercial device","free replication","AIM","bench test","considerable number of patients","breathing patient simulator","loaded breathing subjects","Current pricing of commercial mechanical ventilators","range of obstructive","pressure transducers","construction details open source","open-source hardware description","healthy volunteers","restrictive disease","serious shortage of ventilators","off-the-shelf materials available","digital display","abdominal bands","high airway resistance","Arduino Nano controller","middle-income countries","total retail cost","expiratory pressures","chronic respiratory failure","e-commerce","scale","life","difference","high-pressure blower","cmH","therapy","application","availability","RESULTS","Lumis","faulty triggering","CONCLUSION","Resmed","difficulty score","METHODS","support"],"language":"en"},

A tax policy driven departure signal and a demand side focused growth programme could make an important contribution to a new economic dynamic after the crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00FCther, Michael; Bardt, Hubertus","journal":"Wirtschaftsdienst","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336804/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10273-020-2635-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["economic life","crisis","new economic dynamic","considerable economic consequences","economy\u2019s restart","important contribution","clear signals","Important areas","focused growth programme","growth data levels","clear exit strategy","synchronised restart of complex industrial value chains","demand","tax policy driven departure signal","steps","various liquidity lines","previous welfare","loans","relaunch of public infrastructure","service sectors","industry","insulation of social","coronavirus pandemic","schools","planned schedule","survival","medical pre-conditions","fight","kindergartens","shutdown","resumption of activity"],"language":"en"},

The biological significance of the novel synthesized quinazolines was highlighted by evaluating them in vitro for antiviral activity, wherein several compounds exhibited excellent activity specifically against vaccinia and adenovirus. Especially, 24b11 displayed the most potent inhibitory activity against vaccinia with an EC50 value of 1.7\u03BCM, which was 15 fold than that of the reference drug Cidofovir (EC50 =25\u03BCM). 24b13 was the most potent compound against adenovirus-2 with an EC50 value of 6.2\u03BCM, which proved lower than all the reference drugs.

However, the genome of this strain harbours at least two more genes that code for other small, cysteine-rich and cationic proteins with potential antifungal activity. In this study, we characterized the pafB gene product that shows high similarity to PgAFP from P. chrysogenum R42C. Although abundant and timely regulated pafB gene transcripts were detected, we could not identify PAFB in the culture broth of P. chrysogenum Q176. Therefore, we applied a P. chrysogenum-based expression system to produce sufficient amounts of recombinant PAFB to address unanswered questions concerning the structure and antimicrobial function. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based analyses revealed a compact \u03B2-folded structure, comprising five \u03B2-strands connected by four solvent exposed and flexible loops and an \u201Cabcabc\u201D disulphide bond pattern. We identified PAFB as an inhibitor of growth of human pathogenic moulds and yeasts.

These diverse findings support the notion that LIPS is a useful technology for generating antibody profiles for personalized diagnosis and monitoring of human health.","publish_time":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burbelo, Peter D.; Lebovitz, Evan E.; Notkins, Abner L.","journal":"Translational Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9813b3096f02bf382cd6cea374e7f24b0c93abf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7cabc643ca55962c0405940a02f5482016cef150.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4306608.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4306608?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2014.08.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931524414003053; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931524414003053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241936/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Antibody profiles","personalized diagnosis","infectious agents","useful technology","immunoassay technology","individual exposure profiles","general format of LIPS","self-proteins","recombinant proteins","high quality antibody data","personalized medicine","human autoimmune diseases","monitoring of human health","anti-cytokine autoantibodies","diabetes","systemic lupus erythematosus","immunodeficiencies secondary","Sj\u00F6gren\u0027s syndrome","pathogen discovery","type","harnesses light","multiple antigens","Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems","important information","autoimmunity","notion","studies","large dynamic range of detection","potential","diverse findings","usefulness"],"language":"en"},

The role of air transport in the diffusion of the disease became obvious early in the crisis; to assess that role more carefully, this study relates the spatial\u2010temporal pattern of the SARS outbreak to a measure of airline network accessibility. Specifically, the accessibility from those countries that were infected by SARS, beginning with China, to other countries was measured using airline schedules. The country\u2010pair accessibility measure, along with other country\u2010level factors relevant to the disease, were tested as determinants of the speed with which SARS arrived in infected countries as well as its failure to arrive in most countries. The analyses indicate that airline network accessibility was an especially influential variable but also that the importance of this variable diminished in the latter weeks of the outbreak. The latter finding is partly attributable to public health measures, particularly health screening in airports. The timing and geography of those measures are reviewed using data from media reports and interim World Health Organization (WHO) documents during the outbreak. The uneven effort to curtail the international diffusion of SARS suggests further planning is needed to develop a concerted response to contain future epidemics.","publish_time":"2006-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"BOWEN, JOHN T; LAROE, CHRISTIAN","journal":"Geogr J","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194177.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4959.2006.00196.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367889/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS outbreak","infected countries","measure of airline network accessibility","international diffusion of SARS","pair accessibility measure","public health measures","health screening","country","airline schedules","China","transmissible infectious disease","interim World Health Organization","influential variable","role of air transport","media reports","data","severe acute respiratory syndrome","temporal pattern","months","study","crisis","level factors relevant","planning","documents","concerted response","future epidemics","uneven effort","century","finding","importance","airports","speed","Taiwan","determinants","analyses","failure","timing","geography","weeks","fewer"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for dogs diagnosed with presumptive spinal\u2010only meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin between 2006 and 2015. RESULTS: 21 dogs were included; the majority presented with an acute (43%) or chronic (52%) onset of neurological signs. Ambulatory paresis was the most common neurological presentation (67%). Neurological examination most commonly revealed a T3\u2010L3 myelopathy, and spinal hyperaesthesia was a common finding (71%). A spinal cord lesion was visible in 90% of cases on magnetic resonance imaging. Eighteen lesions (86%) showed parenchymal contrast enhancement and 17 lesions (81%) showed contrast enhancement of overlying meninges. All dogs were treated with immunosuppressive doses of glucocorticosteroids, sometimes combined with cytosine arabinoside.

The forward-backward translation method was used to translate the English version of the questionnaire into Bangla. The reliability and validity properties of the Bangla FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilizing both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables, national lockdown variables, and response to the Bangla Health Patient Questionnaire. The sample comprised 8550 Bangladeshi participants. The Cronbach \u03B1 value for the Bangla FCV-19S was 0.871 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S fitted well with the data.

Methods We enrolled smear-positive TB patients aged \u003E 16 years with delayed respiratory isolation following hospitalization. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Time intervals between admission, order of sputum acid-fast staining, initiation of anti-tuberculous treatment and isolation were compared between pulmonology/infectious diseases wards (PIWs) and other wards.

Investigating the molecular basis of camel traits has been limited by: (1) the absence of a comprehensive record of morphological trait variation (e.g., diseases) and the associated mode of inheritance, (2) the lack of extended pedigrees of specific trait(s), and (3) the long reproductive cycle of the camel, which makes the cost of establishing and maintaining a breeding colony (i.e., monitoring crosses) prohibitively high. Overcoming these challenges requires (1) detailed documentation of phenotypes/genetic diseases and their likely mode of inheritance (and collection of related DNA samples), (2) conducting association studies to identify phenotypes/genetic diseases causing genetic variants (instead of classical linkage analysis, which requires extended pedigrees), and (3) validating likely causative variants by screening a large number of camel samples from different populations.

Donor and acceptor template homology facilitates both replicative and recombinogenic transfers, but homology-independent determinants may also contribute. Here, improved murine leukemia virus-based assays were established and the effects of varying extents of mismatches and complementarity between primer and acceptor template regions were assessed. Template switch accuracy was addressed by examining provirus structures, and efficiency was measured using a competitive titer assay. The results demonstrated that limited mismatch extension occurred readily during both minus and plus strand transfer. A strong bias for correct targeting to the U3/R junction and against use of alternate regions of homology was observed during minus strand transfer. Transfer to the U3/R junction was as accurate with five bases of complementarity as it was with an intact R, and as few as 3nt targeted transfer to a limited extent. In contrast, 12 base recombinogenic acceptors were utilized poorly and no accurate switch was observed when recombination acceptors retained only five bases of complementarity. These findings confirm that murine leukemia virus replicative and recombinogenic template switches differ in homology requirements, and support the notion that factors other than primer\u2013template complementarity may contribute to strong stop acceptor template recognition.","publish_time":"2003-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marr, Sharon Fodor; Telesnitsky, Alice","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2918a43791587306be37d4e23f804c1efdbdd8fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173232.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283603005977; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603005977","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["template complementarity","acceptor template homology","recombinogenic template switches","replicative template switches","acceptor template regions","minus strand transfer","recombinogenic switches","Template switch accuracy","strand strong stop transfer","strong stop acceptor template recognition","bases of complementarity","homology requirements","recombinogenic transfers","R junction","base recombinogenic acceptors","nt targeted transfer","murine leukemia virus replicative","use of alternate regions of homology","U3","homology-independent determinants","primer","strong bias","accurate switch","intact R","murine leukemia virus-based assays","recombination acceptors","limited extent","limited mismatch extension","correct targeting","effects of varying extents of mismatches","Abstract Reverse transcription","efficiency","findings","provirus structures","results","contrast","notion","Donor","competitive titer assay"],"language":"en"},

Then we discovered that induction of autophagy by rapamycin significantly enhances the viral titers of PRRSV, while inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA and silencing of LC3 gene by siRNA reduces the yield of PRRSV. The results showed functional autolysosomes can be formed after PRRSV infection and the autophagosome\u2013lysosome-fusion inhibitor decreases the virus titers.

These two proteins were identified as putatively nonstructural (ns) due to their homology to the corresponding BCV ns gene products. Northern blot analysis indicated that each of these two genes was present on a separate mRNA (5 and 5-1, respectively). In vitro translation analyses demonstrated that the HCV-OC43 9.5-kDa protein, like its BCV counterpart, is poorly translated when situated downstream of the 12.9-kDa ORF, although immunofluorescence studies did confirm its presence in infected cells. Sequence analysis showed that a large portion of the 3\u2032-end of the leader sequence is present within the viral genome, upstream of the 12.9-kDa ORF. In addition, two ORFs encoding potential 4.9- and 4.8-kDa ns proteins in BCV are absent in HCV-OC43, although a corresponding mRNA 4 was found at a very low level.

If so, surveillance for genetic markers of adaptation could help to predict the risk of disease emergence. However, adaptation is difficult to distinguish conclusively from the other processes that generate genetic change. In this Review we survey the research on the host jumps of influenza A, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, canine parvovirus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus to illustrate the insights that can arise from combining genetic surveillance with microbiological experimentation in the context of epidemiological data. We argue that using a multidisciplinary approach for surveillance will provide a better understanding of when adaptations are required for host jumps and thus when predictive genetic markers may be present.

Methods During August 2009\u2013July 2011, prospective population-based surveillance was conducted for hospitalizations of children aged \u003C5 years in a rural community in Haryana State. Clinical data and respiratory specimens were collected. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR for influenza and parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, and adenovirus. Average annual hospitalization incidence was calculated using census data and adjusted for hospitalizations reported to occur at non-study hospitals according to a comunity healthcare utilization survey. Results Of 245 hospitalized children, respiratory viruses were detected among 98 (40%), of whom 92 (94%) had fever or respiratory symptoms. RSV accounted for the highest virus-associated hospitalization incidence (34.6/10,000, 95% CI 26.3\u201344.7) and 20% of hospitalizations. There were 11.8/10,000 (95% CI 7.9\u201318.4) influenza-associated hospitalizations (7% of hospitalizations). RSV and influenza virus detection peaked in winter (November\u2013February) and rainy seasons (July), respectively. Conclusion Respiratory viruses were associated with a substantial proportion of hospitalizations among young children in a rural Indian community. Public health research and prevention in India should consider targeting RSV and influenza in young children.","publish_time":"2014-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broor, Shobha; Dawood, Fatimah S.; Pandey, Bharti G.; Saha, Siddhartha; Gupta, Vivek; Krishnan, Anand; Rai, Sanjay; Singh, Pratibha; Erdman, Dean; Lal, Renu B.","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71c47d96b18e5f079eed186269e9b2df25fa9c29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112698.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445313003393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24269675/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445313003393; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2013.11.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Haryana State","India"],"keyphrases":["hospitalizations of children","young children","influenza-associated hospitalizations","respiratory syncytial virus","RSV","Conclusion Respiratory viruses","respiratory specimens","respiratory symptoms","hospitalized children","world\u0027s children","incidence of severe respiratory virus infections","influenza virus detection","substantial proportion of hospitalizations","highest virus-associated hospitalization incidence","parainfluenza viruses","years","rural community","Average annual hospitalization incidence","rural Indian community","substantial morbidity","census data","Clinical data","human metapneumovirus","prevention","non-study hospitals","comunity healthcare utilization survey","RT-PCR","Public health research","coronaviruses","prospective population-based surveillance","Haryana State","adenovirus","winter","Summary Objectives","Results","Swabs","fever","rainy seasons","Methods"],"language":"en"},

USP2, a cysteine protease and a member of the ubiquitin specific protease family, is overexpressed in prostate cancer and stabilizes fatty acid synthase, which has been associated with the malignancy of some aggressive prostate cancers. Here, we report the structure of the human USP2 catalytic domain in complex with ubiquitin. Ubiquitin uses two major sites for the interaction with the protease. Both sites are required simultaneously, as shown by USP2 inhibition assays with peptides and ubiquitin mutants. In addition, a layer of ordered water molecules mediates key interactions between ubiquitin and USP2. As several of those molecules are found at identical positions in the previously solved USP7/ubiquitin-aldehyde complex structure, we suggest a general mechanism of water-mediated ubiquitin recognition by USPs.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Renatus, Martin; Parrado, Shirley Gil; D\u0027Arcy, Allan; Eidhoff, Ulf; Gerhartz, Bernd; Hassiepen, Ulrich; Pierrat, Benoit; Riedl, Ralph; Vinzenz, Daniela; Worpenberg, Susanne; Kroemer, Markus","journal":"Structure","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37d0e4a0276b8216314aebc7c21ad4ffc9ddb052.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126176.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969212606002954; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212606002954","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USPs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ubiquitin mutants","ubiquitin-aldehyde complex structure","mediated ubiquitin recognition","ubiquitin specific protease family","USP2 inhibition assays","cysteine protease","human USP2 catalytic domain","layer of ordered water molecules","major sites","general mechanism of water","aggressive prostate cancers","solved USP7","key interactions","Summary Deubiquitinating proteases reverse protein ubiquitination","member","target proteins","peptides","fatty acid synthase","identical positions","USPs","destruction","proteasome","malignancy","addition"],"language":"en"},

Such patients often experience rapid deterioration and need for mechanical ventilation. Currently, no prospectively validated biomarker of impending respiratory failure is available. Objective We aimed to identify and prospectively validate biomarkers that allow the identification of patients in need of impending mechanical ventilation. Methods Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized from February 29th to April 09th, 2020 were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings at admission and during the disease. Data from 89 evaluable patients were available for the purpose of analysis comprising an initial evaluation cohort (n=40) followed by a temporally separated validation cohort (n=49). Results We identified markers of inflammation, LDH and creatinine as most predictive variables of respiratory failure in the evaluation cohort. Maximal interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels before intubation showed the strongest association with the need of mechanical ventilation followed by maximal CRP. Respective AUC values for IL-6 and CRP in the evaluation cohort were 0.97 and 0.86 and similar in the validation cohort 0.90 and 0.83. The calculated optimal cutoff values in the course of disease from the evaluation cohort (IL-6\u003E 80 pg/ml and CRP\u003E 97 mg/l) both correctly classified 80% of patients in the validation cohort regarding their risk of respiratory failure. Conclusion Maximal levels of IL-6 followed by CRP were highly predictive of the need for mechanical ventilation. This suggests the possibility of using IL-6 or CRP levels to guide escalation of treatment in patients with COVID-19 related hyperinflammatory syndrome.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herold, Tobias; Jurinovic, Vindi; Arnreich, Chiara; Lipworth, Brian J.; Hellmuth, Johannes C.; von Bergwelt-Baildon, Michael; Klein, Matthias; Weinberger, Tobias","journal":"J. allergy clin. immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/385de938da146d8666c1200b146925e1f346c0a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920306850; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920306850?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425269/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.05.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["need of mechanical ventilation","initial evaluation cohort","CRP levels","maximal CRP","separated validation cohort","need of impending mechanical ventilation","evaluable patients","identification of patients","Methods Patients","Conclusion Maximal levels of IL","risk of respiratory failure","predictive variables of respiratory failure","validated biomarker of impending respiratory failure","Maximal interleukin","Abstract Background COVID","course of disease","Respective AUC values","calculated optimal cutoff values","creatinine","purpose of analysis","strongest association","viral induced hyperinflammation","multi-organ involvement","admission","LDH","escalation of treatment","laboratory findings","baseline clinical","intubation","rapid deterioration","related hyperinflammatory syndrome","markers of inflammation","Data","biomarkers","pg","possibility","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Olive oil polyphenols are known to induce beneficial effects in several pathological conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and to contrast the proliferation of cancer cells or hypercholesterolemia. Polyphenols are also present in waste products derived from the olive industry: olive mill wastewaters (OMWW) are rich in polyphenols and there is an increasing interest in using OMWW in animal nutrition. OMWW are attributed with positive effects in promoting chicken performance and the quality of food-derived products. However, a tissue-specific transcriptome target analysis of chickens fed with OMWW has never been attempted. RESULTS: We explored the effect of dietary OMWW on the intestinal function in broilers. A morphological analysis of the jejunum revealed that OMWW reduced crypt depth, whereas no significant modifications were observed for villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio. An RNA Sequencing analysis was performed on isolated, intestinal, epithelial cells and 280 differentially expressed genes were found using a count-based approach. An enrichment analysis revealed that the majority of up regulated genes in the OMWW group were over-represented by the regulation of viral genome replication-related GO-Terms, whereas down regulated genes were mainly involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed how an industrial waste product can be recycled as a feed additive with a positive relapse. OMWW dietary supplementation can be a nutritional strategy to improve chicken performance and health, prevent intestinal damage, enhance innate immunity and regulate cholesterol metabolism and fat deposition.

Memorizing medicinal plants for the treatment of serious diseases likely maximized the chances of survival and reproduction and was instrumental in the evolutionary success of our species. In the present study, we used the idea of adaptive memory to understand whether human memory evolved to recall information about medicinal plants for the treatment of serious diseases. We considered plant-disease pairs of words as units of information available in a medical system based on the use of medicinal plants. The pairs included in the categories of chronic infectious diseases and transmissible infectious diseases were considered to be of higher adaptive value, whereas those included in the category of common conditions were considered to be of lower adaptive value. Pairs grouped into the category of emerging and reemerging diseases were employed to investigate conformity bias; pairs belonging to the category esthetic uses were considered to be of little adaptive relevance and utilized as an experimental control. Our results revealed that plant-disease pairs associated with the category of common conditions, considered by us to be of lower severity and less adaptive relevance for humans, were better remembered and retained in the participants\u0027 memory.

It is unclear whether the prognosis for AECOPD differs depending on the bacterium or virus identified. The purpose of this study is to determine whether readmission of patients with severe AECOPD varies according to the bacterium or virus identified. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of medical records of 704 severe AECOPD events at Korea University Guro Hospital from January 2011 to May 2017. We divided events into two groups, one in which patients were readmitted within 30 days after discharge and the other in which there was no readmission. RESULTS: Of the 704 events, 65 were followed by readmission within 30 days. Before propensity score matching, the readmission group showed a higher rate of bacterial identification with no viral identification and a higher rate of identification with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P=0.003 and P=0.007, respectively). Using propensity score matching, the readmission group still showed a higher P. aeruginosa identification rate (P=0.030), but there was no significant difference in the rate of bacterial identification, with no viral identification (P=0.210). In multivariate analysis, the readmission group showed a higher P. aeruginosa identification rate than the no-readmission group (odds ratio, 4.749; 95% confidence interval, 1.296\u201317.041; P=0.019).

The results of culture methods, PCR, and immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate assays for Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) in BALF were analyzed. Further, the diagnostic thresholds for Aspergillus GM and Pneumocystis jiroveci were also calculated. Microbiological findings were present in 87% of BALF samples. Possible infectious pathogens were detected in 55% of cases; 32% were classified as colonizing. No significant difference in diagnostic yield or pathogen spectrum was found between non-neutropenic and neutropenic patients. There was one significant difference in BALF findings among intensive care units (ICU) versus non-ICU patients for Aspergillus spp. (22% versus 9%, p = 0.03). The most common pathogens were Aspergillus spp. (n = 86, 33% of BAL with causative pathogens) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 46, 18%); polymicrobial etiology was documented in 20% of cases. A quantitative PCR value of \u003E 1860 cp/mL for Pneumocystis jirovecii was set as a diagnostic threshold for pneumocystis pneumonia. The absorbance index of GM in BALF of 0.5 was set as a diagnostic threshold for aspergillosis. The examination of BAL fluid revealed the presence of pathogen in more than 50% of cases and is, therefore, highly useful in this regard when concerning pulmonary infiltrates.

First, there is the key question of labour as an active agent in the production of economic landscapes. The agency of labour will likely remain a defining feature of labour geography, but perhaps it is not as important to construct theoretical analytical boundaries as it is to define labour geography as a political project. Second, debates continue surrounding the production of scale and the multiscalarity of organized labour. Third, labour geographers have yet to engage in any sustained fashion with unpacking the complex identities of workers and the way in which those identities simultaneously are shaped by and shape the economic and cultural landscape. Fourth, there is some debate on the costs and benefits of a \u2018normative\u2019 labour geography which emphasizes what workers and their organizations \u2018could\u2019 or even \u2018should\u2019 do. Lastly, we challenge the assumption that labour geographers have not yet asserted themselves as activists in their own right. We conclude the editorial by introducing the articles included in the issue. While these articles may not address every gap in the literature, they do contribute in significant ways to move the labour geography project forward.","publish_time":"2009-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tufts, Steven; Savage, Lydia","journal":"Geoforum","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88830e061b50d27536ef609ba2306bacdee78d57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094509.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226098/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718509001493; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2009.10.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016718509001493","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["labour geographers","labour geography project","agency of labour","young field of labour geography","defining feature of labour geography","key question of labour","multiscalarity of organized labour","articles","important on-going debates","complex identities of workers","production of economic landscapes","production of scale","themed issue","editorial introduction","political project","active agent","future directions","benefits","significant ways","theoretical analytical boundaries","costs","sustained fashion","research","literature","gap","cultural landscape","Abstract","assumption","activists","right","organizations"],"language":"en"},

Previously, groups had targeted conserved coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains against current and future CoVs. With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a conserved 2\u2019O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against future emergent strains. Using the SARS-CoV mouse model, a NSP16 mutant vaccine was evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential for reversion to pathogenesis. Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach. However, combining a 2\u2019O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, and no evidence for reversion. Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2\u2019O MTase in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for rapidly generating live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines. Emergent coronaviruses remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreaks. However, failure of many previous CoV vaccine formulations has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions and especially in vulnerable populations like the aged and immune-compromised. This study illustrates that despite success in young models, the NSP16 mutant carries too much risk for pathogenesis and reversion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand-alone vaccine strategy. Importantly, the NSP16 mutation can be paired with other attenuating approaches to provide robust protection from heterologous challenge and in vulnerable populations. Coupled with increased safety and reduced pathogenesis, the study highlights the potential for NSP16 attenuation as a major component of future live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines.","publish_time":"2018-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menachery, Vineet D.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Mitchell, Hugh D.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Leist, Sarah R.; Yount, Boyd L.; McAnarney, Eileen T.; Graham, Rachel L.; Waters, Katrina M.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97aa36776b5325e16f124c1ecc1617bf8144dc7d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2da0a7ba851e53d21dba05042a397eafcdab093d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/309591","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NSP16 mutant vaccine","manipulation of CoV NSP16","NSP16 attenuation","NSP16 mutation","reversion","live-attenuated vaccine strains","previous CoV vaccine formulations","stand-alone vaccine strategy","future emergent strains","heterologous challenge","efficacy","potential","described CoV fidelity mutant","O MTase mutation","major component of future live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines","future CoVs","platform strategy","future outbreaks","vulnerable populations","vulnerable models","heterologous virus challenge","rapid response vaccine platforms","targeted conserved coronavirus proteins","SARS-CoV mouse model","capable of protection","robust protection","conserved attenuating mutations","zoonotic strains","aged mice","reduced pathogenesis","study","Emergent coronaviruses","O methyltransferase","success","broad attenuation platform","significant threat","attenuating approaches","ongoing threat","young models","global public health","aging host","need","different conditions","risk","groups","virulence","failure","increased safety","new strategies","concerns","evidence","untenable approach","mind","results"],"language":"en"},

Surprisingly, microarray based identification of food-borne viruses, one of the largest groups of pathogenic viruses, causing more than 1.5 billion infections world-wide every year, has lagged behind. Cell-culture techniques are either unavailable or time consuming for routine application. Consequently, current detection methods for these pathogens largely depend on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques, generally requiring an investigator to preselect the target virus of interest. Here we describe the first attempt to use the microarray as an identification tool for these viruses. We have developed methodology to synthesize targets for virus identification without using PCR, making the process genuinely sequence independent. We show here that a tiling microarray can simultaneously detect and identify the genotype and strain of common food-borne viruses in a single experiment.","publish_time":"2011-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Haifeng; Mammel, Mark; Kulka, Mike; Patel, Isha; Jackson, Scott; Goswami, Biswendu B.","journal":"Open Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9665e16e8fd0e3198298f64f70cc9180d1cea36a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3109525.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21660190/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1874357901105010052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identification of food","virus identification","identification tool","Microarray hybridization","tiling microarray","outbreaks of multiple pathogenic viruses","largest groups of pathogenic viruses","PCR","identification of viral genotypes","target virus","strain of common food","Cell-culture techniques","pathogens","humans","time","importance","polymerase chain reaction","targets","current detection methods","routine application","morbidity","investigator","methodology","single experiment","infections world-wide","year","mortality","process","attempt"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: : To examine the biology that potentially underpins immunity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the immunity-induced pathology related to COVID-19 and determine how this impinges on the use of current disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis. OBSERVATIONS: : Although information about the mechanisms of immunity are scant, it appears that monocyte/macrophages and then CD8 T cells are important in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This may be facilitated via anti-viral antibody responses that may prevent re-infection. However, viral escape and infection of leucocytes to promote lymphopenia, apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion coupled with a cytokine storm appears to contribute to the damage in ARDS. IMPLICATIONS: : In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19. In addition, few block the formation of immature B cells within lymphoid tissue that will provide antibody-mediated protection from (re)infection. However, adjustments to dosing schedules may help de-risk the chance of infection further and reduce the concerns of people with MS being treated during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baker, David; Amor, Sandra; Kang, Angray S.; Schmierer, Klaus; Giovannoni, Gavin","journal":"Mult Scler Relat Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03b283d2b7ca915dfb36797868fa229539d8ea25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7214323.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820302509; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102174; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820302509?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","COVID","infection of leucocytes","chance of infection","re-infection","CD8 T cells","multiple sclerosis","multiple-sclerosis","SARS-CoV","ARDS","apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion","mechanisms of immunity","viral escape","virus","related disease","anti-viral antibody responses","antibody-mediated protection","immunity-induced pathology","formation of immature B cells","immunosuppressive treatments","significant risks","significant mortality","use of current disease","ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy","lymphopenia","contrast","lymphoid tissue","major long-term impact","disorders","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","block","de-risk","schedules","cytokine storm","monocyte","therapies","macrophages","innate immune system","information","concerns of people","adjustments","addition","IMPLICATIONS","biology","damage","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVE","OBSERVATIONS","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Based on the analysis of RNA products separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, Nsp15 has been reported to cleave both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the uridine. 1,2 We used several RNAs, including some with nucleotide analogs, and mass spectrometry to determine that Nsp15 cleaves only 3\u2032 of the recognition uridylate, with some cleavage 3\u2032 of cytidylate. A highly conserved RNA structure in the 3\u2032 non-translated region of the SARS virus was cleaved preferentially at one of the unpaired uridylate bases, demonstrating that both RNA structure and base-pairing can affect cleavage by Nsp15. Several modified RNAs that are not cleaved by Nsp15 can bind Nsp15 as competitive inhibitors. The RNA binding affinity of Nsp15 increased with the content of uridylate in substrate RNA and the co-factor Mn2\u002B. The hexameric form of Nsp15 was found to bind RNA in solution. A two-dimensional crystal of Nsp15 in complex with RNA showed that at least two RNA molecules could be bound per hexamer.

Reversible phosphorylation of the inositol ring at positions 3, 4 and 5 results in the synthesis of seven different phosphoinositides. Each phosphoinositide has a unique subcellular distribution with a predominant localization in subsets of membranes. These lipids play a major role in recruiting and regulating the function of proteins at membrane interfaces [1]. Several bacteria and viruses modulate and exploit the host PI metabolism to ensure efficient replication and survival. Here, we focus on the roles of cellular phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) during the replication cycle of various viruses. It has been well documented that phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III\u03B2 (PI4KIII\u03B2, EC 2.7.1.67) is indispensable for viral RNA replication of several picornaviruses. Two recruitment strategies were reported: (i) binding and modulation of GBF1/Arf1 to enhance recruitment of PI4KIII\u03B2 and (ii) interaction with ACBD3 for recruitment of PI4KIII\u03B2. PI4KIII has also been demonstrated to be crucial for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. PI4KIII appears to be directly recruited and activated by HCV NS5A protein to the replication complexes. In contrast to picornaviruses, it is still debated whether the \u03B1 or the \u03B2 isoform is the most important. PI4KIII can be explored as a target for inhibition of viral replication. The challenge will be to develop highly selective inhibitors for PI4KIII\u03B1 and/or \u03B2 and to avoid off-target toxicity.","publish_time":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Delang, Leen; Paeshuyse, Jan; Neyts, Johan","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/566fa6d14ea821735d50ac347aee17383b1e840a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111036.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295212005163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22885339/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2012.07.034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006295212005163","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI","EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficient replication","replication complexes","viral RNA replication","inhibition of viral replication","recruitment of PI4KIII\u03B2","replication cycle of various viruses","binding","recruitment strategies","picornaviruses","roles of cellular phosphatidylinositol","function of proteins","effector proteins","\u03B2 isoform","different phosphoinositides","Abstract Phosphoinositides","target toxicity","host PI metabolism","HCV NS5A protein","predominant localization","unique subcellular distribution","recruiting","phosphate","kinase III\u03B2","PI4P","hepatitis C virus","Arf1","inositol ring","results","positions","phospholipids","PI4Ks","kinases","interaction","major role","Reversible phosphorylation","subsets of membranes","modulation of GBF1","selective inhibitors","PI4KIII\u03B1","synthesis","membrane interfaces","cascades","survival","ACBD3","challenge","contrast","bacteria"],"language":"en"},

Experiments using cells expressing a mutation in the catalytic domain of GBF1 and overexpression of wild type GBF1 or a BFA\u2010resistant GBF1 mutant rescuing HEV replication in BFA\u2010treated cells, confirmed that GBF1 is the only BFA\u2010sensitive factor required for HEV replication.

In contrast, DicV RNA was only detected in 1/77 (1.3%) plasma samples from febrile Tanzanian adults, suggesting that children could represent the primary susceptible population. Estimated viral load by specific quantitative real-time RT\u2013PCR assay ranged from \u003C 1.32E3 to 1.44E7 viral RNA copies/mL serum. Three DicV full-length genomes were obtained, and a phylogenetic analyse on the capsid region showed the presence of two clusters representing tentative novel genus. Although DicV-positive cases were detected throughout the year, a significantly higher positivity rate was observed during the rainy season. This study reveals that novel DicV RNA is frequently detected in the blood of Tanzanian children, paving the way for further investigations to determine if DicV possibly represent a new agent in humans.","publish_time":"2019-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cordey, Samuel; Laubscher, Florian; Hartley, Mary-Anne; Junier, Thomas; P\u00E9rez-Rodriguez, Francisco J.; Keitel, Kristina; Vieille, Gael; Samaka, Josephine; Mlaganile, Tarsis; Kagoro, Frank; Boillat-Blanco, No\u00E9mie; Mbarack, Zainab; Docquier, Myl\u00E8ne; Brito, Francisco; Eibach, Daniel; May, J\u00FCrgen; Sothmann, Peter; Aldrich, Cassandra; Lusingu, John; Tapparel, Caroline; D\u2019Acremont, Val\u00E9rie; Kaiser, Laurent","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec0528e8df97c81c3e94673e83bf614c09090cf1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6493270.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2019.1603791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999808/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sub-Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["novel DicV RNA","febrile Tanzanian children","DicV-positive cases","DicV full-length genomes","febrile Tanzanian adults","blood of Tanzanian children","44E7 viral RNA copies","viral load","viral origin","febrile episodes","tentative novel genus","specific quantitative real-time RT","leading cause of paediatric outpatient consultations","sera","PCR assay","Sub-Saharan Africa","year","presence","clusters","higher positivity rate","putative causative pathogen","plasma samples","serum","32E3","dicistroviruses","novo assembly sequencing approach","capsid region","detection","Fever","primary susceptible population","new agent","way","study","rainy season","humans","quarter","investigations","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Intensification of cART does not decrease the residual viral load or immune activation. cART restricts the synthesis of infectious virus but does not curtail HIV-1 transcription and translation from either the integrated or unintegrated viral genomes in infected cells. All treated patients with full viral suppression actually have low-level viremia. More than 60% of treated individuals also develop minor HIV-1 \u2013associated neurocognitive deficits (HAND) due to residual virus and immune activation. Thus, new therapeutic agents are needed to curtail HIV-1 transcription and residual virus. In this study, luteolin, a dietary supplement, profoundly reduced HIV-1 infection in reporter cells and primary lymphocytes. HIV-1inhibition by luteolin was independent of viral entry, as shown by the fact that wild-type and VSV\u2013pseudotyped HIV-1 infections were similarly inhibited. Luteolin was unable to inhibit viral reverse transcription. Luteolin had antiviral activity in a latent HIV-1 reactivation model and effectively ablated both clade-B- and -C -Tat-driven LTR transactivation in reporter assays but had no effect on Tat expression and its sub-cellular localization. We conclude that luteolin confers anti\u2013HIV-1 activity at the Tat functional level. Given its biosafety profile and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, luteolin may serve as a base flavonoid to develop potent anti\u2013HIV-1 derivatives to complement cART.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehla, Rajeev; Bivalkar-Mehla, Shalmali; Chauhan, Ashok","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f56a6e854737649264b48f3709c54551d3660edd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3227592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22140483/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0027915","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Luteolin"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["luteolin","latent HIV","pseudotyped HIV","reduced HIV","minor HIV","residual virus","residual viral load","residual infection","viral suppression","viral reverse transcription","Intensification of cART","unintegrated viral genomes","independent of viral entry","C -Tat","Tat expression","reporter cells","immune activation","Tat functional level","synthesis of infectious virus","reporter assays","infected cells","antiviral activity","treated patients","treated individuals","VSV","driven LTR transactivation","dietary supplement","wild-type","effectiveness of combination antiretroviral treatment","base flavonoid","sub-cellular localization","ability","fact","blood-brain barrier","reactivation model","different cell types","primary lymphocytes","HAND","neurocognitive deficits","translation","derivatives","inhibition","clade-B","low-level viremia","study","infections","evidence","new therapeutic agents","biosafety profile"],"language":"en"},

Motivated in part by these experiments, we performed simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the response of a PK over a range of mechanical forces ($f$s) and monovalent salt concentrations ($C$s). The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce the multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our model. The free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments. By varying $f$ and $C$, we calculated the phase diagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions, populating distinct intermediate states. As $f$ and $C$ are changed, the stem-loop tertiary interactions rupture first, followed by unfolding of the $3^{\\prime}$-end hairpin ($\\textrm{I}\\rightleftharpoons\\textrm{F}$). Finally, the $5^{\\prime}$-end hairpin unravels, producing an extended state ($\\textrm{E}\\rightleftharpoons\\textrm{I}$).

The sequence contains two open reading frames (ORFs) which are homologous to ORFs in corresponding regions of L1 elements in other species. The L1H8 ORFs are separated by a small evolutionarily nonconserved region. The 5\u2032 end of the consensus contains frequent terminators in all three reading frames and has a relatively high GC content with numerous stretches of weak homology with AluI repeats. The 5\u2032 ORF extends for a minimum of 723 bp (241 codons). The 3\u2032 ORF is 3843 bp (1281 codons) and predicts a protein of 149 kD which has regions of weak homology to the polymerase domain of various reverse transcriptases. The 3\u2032 end of the consensus has a 208-bp nonconserved region followed by an adenine-rich end. The organization of the L1H8 consensus sequence resembles the structure of eukaryotic mRNAs except for the noncoding region between ORFs. However, due to base substitutions or truncation most elements appear incapable of producing mRNA that can be translated. Our observation that individual elements cluster into subfamilies on the basis of the presence or absence of blocks of sequence, or by the linkage of alternative bases at multiple positions, suggests that most L1 sequences were derived from a small number of structural genes. An estimate of the mammalian L1 substitution rate was derived and used to predict the age of individual human elements. From this it follows that the majority of human L1 sequences have been generated within the last 30 million years. The human elements studied here differ from each other, yet overall the L1H8 sequences demonstrate a pattern of species-specificity when compared to the L1 families of other mammals. Possible mechanisms that may account for the origin and evolution of the L1 family are discussed. These include pseudogene formation (retroposition), transposition, gene conversion, and RNA recombination.","publish_time":"1987-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scott, Alan F.; Schmeckpeper, Barbara J.; Abdelrazik, Mona; Comey, Catherine Theisen; O\u0027Hara, Bruce; Rossiter, Judith Pratt; Cooley, Tim; Heath, Peter; Smith, Kirby D.; Margolet, Louise","journal":"Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc906285d06f6d7596e1793da1dadfe9242a09a5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0888754387900036; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0888754387900036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["L1H8 consensus sequence","L1H8 ORFs","corresponding regions of L1 elements","L1H8 sequences","L1 families","L1 family","majority of human L1 sequences","KpnI sequence","age of individual human elements","individual elements cluster","bp nonconserved region","mammalian L1 substitution rate","regions of weak homology","noncoding region","codons","open reading frames","adenine-rich end","numerous stretches of weak homology","pattern of species","small number of structural genes","interspersed repeated DNA element","transposition","high GC content","subfamilies","LINE","structure of eukaryotic mRNAs","multiple positions","polymerase domain of various reverse transcriptases","retroposition","gene conversion","presence","basis","frequent terminators","AluI repeats","linkage of alternative bases","truncation","origin","estimate","kD","observation","specificity","RNA recombination","base substitutions","absence of blocks","pseudogene formation","protein","evolution","minimum","organization","mammals","Possible mechanisms","years"],"language":"en"},

Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged \u226518 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2\u201310 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1\u00B723 [95% CI 0\u00B787\u20131\u00B775]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1\u00B752 [0\u00B795\u20132\u00B743]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early. INTERPRETATION: In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.

METHODS: The relevant clinical and imaging data of 19 cases, including 10 males and 9 females, with pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza (H7N9) was retrospectively analyzed. One of the cases had received percutaneous lung biopsy, with the clinical, imaging and pathological changes possible to be analyzed. RESULTS: The lesions were mainly located at lower lobes and dorsal of lungs, involving multiple lobes and segments. Ground-glass opacities and/or pulmonary opacities were the more often imaging manifestations of severe pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza (H7N9) in early and evolving phases (19/19,100%). By biopsy following percutaneous lung puncture, exudation of slurry, cellulose, RBC and neutrophils, formation of hyaline membrane, squamous metaplasia and organizing exudates were observable at the alveolar space. Some of alveoli collapsed, and some responded to show compensatory emphysema. CONCLUSION: The imaging features of severe pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza (H7N9) include obvious ground-glass opacity and pulmonary consolidation, mainly at lower lobes and dorsal of lungs, with rapid changes. The cross-analysis of imaging and pathology preliminary can elucidate the pathological mechanisms of ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidation of severe pneumonia. Such an intensive study is beneficial to prompt clinicians to observe and evaluate the progress of the disease. In addition, it is also in favor of managing the symptoms and reducing the mortality rate.","publish_time":"2015-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Zheng; Huang, Xiang-rong; Lu, Pu-xuan; Le, Xiao-hua; Li, Jing-jing; Chen, De-ming; Yuan, Jing; Li, Guo-bao; Liu, Ying-xia; Zhou, Bo-ping","journal":"Radiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97aef3e3fc062de1cd816862cf5f883046088468.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104100.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2015.02.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289065/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352621115000078; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352621115000078","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human infected avian influenza","H7N9","imaging features of severe pneumonia","imaging manifestations of severe pneumonia","pulmonary consolidation of severe pneumonia","pathological findings of severe pneumonia","imaging data","diagnostic accuracy of severe pneumonia","pulmonary opacities","Ground-glass opacities","lower lobes","pathological mechanisms of ground","obvious ground-glass opacity","dorsal of lungs","percutaneous lung biopsy","multiple lobes","pathological changes possible","cases","percutaneous lung puncture","rapid changes","exudation of slurry","formation of hyaline membrane","exudates","squamous metaplasia","neutrophils","RBC","cellulose","pathology preliminary","observable","prompt clinicians","intensive study","cross-analysis","symptoms","alveolar space","evolving phases","lesions","segments","METHODS","CONCLUSION","females","favor","mortality rate","progress","compensatory emphysema","addition","disease","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","alveoli"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health care system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter\u0027s integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 1-April 8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that, compared with non-Hispanic white patients, African Americans had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization, after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and income. We explore possible explanations for this, including societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option.

We demonstrated a strategy, tetramer-guided epitope mapping, that specific CD4\u002B T cell epitopes can be identified by using PBMC from subjects that have not been exposed to the infectious organism. Sixteen HLA-DR0401- and 14 HLA-DR0701-restricted epitopes within spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were identified. Among these, spike protein residues 159\u2013171, 166\u2013178, 449\u2013461 and 1083\u20131097 were identified to contain naturally processed immunodominant epitopes based on strong in vitro T cell responses of PBMC (as assayed by tetramer staining) to intact spike protein stimulation. These immunodominant epitopes were confirmed in vivo in HLA-DR0401 transgenic mice by immunizing with spike protein. Furthermore, the epitope-specific T cells from naive donors secreted IFN-\u03B3 and IL-13 upon re-stimulation with corresponding tetramers.

The severity of disease and spread of this epidemic virus present a serious public health threat in the absence of vaccines or anti-viral therapies. Here, we describe a novel vaccine that protects against emerging CHIKV infection of non-human primates (NHP). We show that selective expression of viral structural proteins gives rise to virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro that resemble replication-competent alphaviruses. Immunization with these VLPs elicited neutralizing antibodies against envelope proteins from different CHIKV strains. Monkeys immunized with VLPs produced high titer neutralizing antibodies that protected against viremia after high dose challenge. We transferred these antibodies into immunodeficient mice, where they protected against subsequent lethal CHIKV challenge, establishing a humoral mechanism of protection. Immunization with alphavirus VLP vaccines represents a strategy to contain the spread of CHIKV and related pathogenic viruses in humans.","publish_time":"2010-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akahata, Wataru; Yang, Zhi-yong; Andersen, Hanne; Sun, Siyang; Holdaway, Heather A.; Kong, Wing-Pui; Lewis, Mark G.; Higgs, Stephen; Rossmann, Michael G.; Rao, Srinivas; Nabel, Gary J.","journal":"Nat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6ed892b894ed62251a8cb78b5bca37318a03a4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2834826.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.2105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20111039/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VLP"],"locations":["Africa","Europe","Kenya"],"keyphrases":["spread of CHIKV","VLPs","neutralizing antibodies","different CHIKV strains","subsequent lethal CHIKV challenge","epidemic virus","Chikungunya virus","Immunization","emerging CHIKV infection of non-human primates","high dose challenge","envelope proteins","absence of vaccines","high titer","selective expression of viral structural proteins","alphavirus VLP vaccines","anti-viral therapies","serious public health threat","rise","infected millions of people","Africa","related pathogenic viruses","viremia","strategy","Europe","NHP","humans","humoral mechanism of protection","novel vaccine","Asia1","Monkeys","particles","immunodeficient mice","replication-competent alphaviruses","re-emergence","severity of disease","Kenya"],"language":"en"},

The envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer on the surface of HIV is responsible for receptor binding and fusion. While Env can tolerate a high degree of mutation in five variable regions (V1-V5), and also at N-linked glycosylation sites that contribute roughly half the mass of Env, the functional sites for recognition of receptor CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4/CCR5 are conserved and essential for viral fitness. Soluble SOSIP Env trimers are structural and antigenic mimics of the pre-fusion native, surface-presented Env(3,4), targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Thus, they are attractive immunogens for vaccine development [for review see(5\u20138)]. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of subtype B B41 SOSIP Env trimers in complex with CD4 and antibody 17b, or with antibody b12, at resolutions of ~3.7 \u00C5 and ~3.6 \u00C5, respectively, and compare them to cryoEM reconstructions of ligand-free B41 SOSIP Env trimers or in complex with either CD4 or CD4bs antibody PGV04, at ~5.6 \u00C5, ~5.2 \u00C5 and ~7.4 \u00C5, respectively. Consequently, we present the most complete description and understanding of the CD4/17b-induced intermediate and provide the molecular basis of the receptor-binding induced conformational change required for HIV-1 entry into host cells.

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of micafungin in patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA). METHODS: A multinational, non-comparative study was conducted to examine proven or probable (pulmonary only) Aspergillus species infection in a wide variety of patient populations. The study employed an open-label design utilizing micafungin alone or in combination with another systemic antifungal agent. Criteria for IA and therapeutic responses were judged by an independent panel. RESULTS: Of the 331 patients enrolled, only 225 met diagnostic criteria for IA as determined by the independent panel and received at least one dose of micafungin. Patients included 98/225 who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (88/98 allogeneic), 48 with graft versus host disease (GVHD), and 83/225 who had received chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. A favorable response rate at the end of therapy was seen in 35.6% (80/225) of patients. Of those only treated with micafungin, favorable responses were seen in 6/12 (50%) of the primary and 9/22 (40.9%) of the salvage therapy group, with corresponding numbers in the combination treatment groups of 5/17 (29.4%) and 60/174 (34.5%) of the primary and salvage treatment groups, respectively. Of the 326 micafungin-treated patients, 183 (56.1%) died during therapy or in the 6-week follow-up phase; 107 (58.5%) deaths were attributable to IA.

In the recommendations of the German Society for Rheumatology (www.dgrh.de), it is recommended that our patients continue the antirheumatic therapy to maintain remission or low state of activity despite the pandemic. In this study, patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease were asked in the first weeks of the pandemic on their opinion of their immunomodulating therapy. The result shows that over 90% of the patients followed the recommendation of the rheumatologist to continue the antirheumatic therapy, and only a small percentage of the patients terminated the therapy on their own.

Twenty-eight percent of these cases were in the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Region, where the annual case detection rate was 281 per 100000 population\u2014more than double the global average of 133 per 100000. Of the 9.6 million people who developed TB, an estimated 1.2 million (12%) were HIV-positive, and the Africa Region accounted for 74% of these cases. Three million people with TB remain undiagnosed and untreated. Globally, an estimated 480000 had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Whilst of the African countries, only South Africa has reported a high prevalence of MDR-TB, it is likely that all of Sub-Saharan Africa has an unreported high load of drug-resistant TB. Tragically, in 2014, only 48% of individuals diagnosed with MDR-TB had successful treatment and an estimated 190000 people died of MDR-TB. Of the global TB funding gap of US$ 0.8 billion, the largest funding gap was in the Africa Region, amounting to US$ 0.4 billion in 2015. The MDR-TB pandemic in particular now threatens to devastate entire regions and may fundamentally alter the life-expectancy and demographic profile of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The theme designated for this year\u0027s World TB Day, March 24, 2016, is \u2018Unite to End TB\u2019.

The non-HCWs had a higher mean C-reactive protein, lower oxygen saturation, and a higher incidence of intubation and death.

One month after discharge, non-HCWs had more signs of fibrosis on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan and an impaired pulmonary function test.

METHODS: Using a biologic and chemical hazard example, the hazard control hierarchy was applied for risk mitigation. FINDINGS: Even when resource constraints force a reordered selection of hazard control elements, risk reduction can be achieved across a variety of hazard classes. CONCLUSION: For LMICs with limited resources, the hazard control hierarchy can be effectively employed, although the selection of methods may be reordered, to achieve significant hazard control. Such prevention strategies can thereby strengthen and sustain a critical pillar of the health system, its workforce.","publish_time":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"McDiarmid, Melissa A.","journal":"Ann Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e841d79130ba70ff159438d44ef9d6a180913397.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103928.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214999614000782; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214999614000782; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aogh.2014.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25459333/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hazard control hierarchy","significant hazard control","classical hierarchy of hazard control technologies","reordered selection of hazard control elements","chemical hazard example","variety of hazard classes","health system","resource-constrained health care settings","health care sector","significant health threats","resource constraints","high-resource settings","workforce","LMICs","selection of methods","risk reduction","risk mitigation","limited resources","middle-income countries","applicability","paper","CONCLUSION","critical pillar","OBJECTIVES","aim","FINDINGS","BACKGROUND","prevention strategies"],"language":"en"},

Both genes have long been considered to share similar overall structure and ligand-binding characteristics. This review presents more recent biochemical and structural studies, which show that they have distinct ligand-binding properties and different physiological functions. Of importance in both these genes is the presence of an extra-cellular domain consisting of an extended neck region encoded by tandem repeats that support the carbohydrate-recognition domain, which plays a crucial role in influencing the pathogen-binding properties of these receptors. The notable difference between these two genes is in this extra-cellular domain. Whilst the tandem-neck-repeat region remains relatively constant size for DC-SIGN, there is considerable polymorphism for L-SIGN. Homo-oligomerization of the neck region of L-SIGN has been shown to be important for high-affinity ligand binding, and heterozygous expression of the polymorphic variants of L-SIGN in which neck lengths differ could thus affect ligand-binding affinity. Functional studies on the effect of this tandem-neck-repeat region on pathogen-binding, as well as genetic association studies for various infectious diseases and among different populations, are discussed. Worldwide demographic data of the tandem-neck-repeat region showing distinct differences in the neck-region allele and genotype distribution among different ethnic groups are presented. These findings support the neck region as an excellent candidate acting as a functional target for selective pressures exerted by pathogens.

While it is well established that ICU-acquired weakness severely impairs long-term prognosis, the association of diaphragm dysfunction with this outcome has never been reported. This study investigated whether diaphragm dysfunction is associated with negative long-term outcomes and whether the coexistence of diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness has a particular association with 2-year survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: This study is an ancillary study derived from an observational cohort study. Patients under mechanical ventilation were enrolled at the time of their first spontaneous breathing trial. Diaphragm dysfunction was defined by tracheal pressure generated by phrenic nerve stimulation \u003C 11 cmH(2)O and ICU-acquired weakness was defined by Medical Research Council (MRC) score \u003C 48. HRQOL was evaluated with the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixty-nine of the 76 patients enrolled in the original study were included in the survival analysis and 40 were interviewed. Overall 2-year survival was 67% (46/69): 64% (29/45) in patients with diaphragm dysfunction, 71% (17/24) in patients without diaphragm dysfunction, 46% (11/24) in patients with ICU-acquired weakness and 76% (34/45) in patients without ICU-acquired weakness. Patients with concomitant diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness had a poorer outcome with a 2-year survival rate of 36% (5/14) compared to patients without diaphragm function and ICU-acquired weakness [79% (11/14) (p \u003C 0.01)].

Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), an enveloped herpesvirus, enters endothelial cells primarily through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Whether ubiquitination and proteasome activity regulates KSHV entry and endocytosis remains unknown. We showed that inhibition of proteasome activity reduced KSHV entry into endothelial cells and intracellular trafficking to nuclei, thus preventing KSHV infection of the cells. Three-dimensional (3-D) analyses revealed accumulation of KSHV particles in a cytoplasmic compartment identified as EEA1\u002B endosomal vesicles upon proteasome inhibition. KSHV particles are colocalized with ubiquitin-binding proteins epsin and eps15. Furthermore, ubiquitination mediates internalization of both KSHV and one of its receptors integrin \u03B21. KSHV particles are colocalized with activated forms of the E3 ligase c-Cbl. Knock-down of c-Cbl or inhibition of its phosphorylation reduced viral entry and intracellular trafficking, resulting in decreased KSHV infectivity. These results demonstrate that ubiquitination mediates internalization of both KSHV and one of its cognate receptors integrin \u03B21, and identify c-Cbl as a potential E3 ligase that facilitates this process.","publish_time":"2012-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greene, Whitney; Zhang, Wei; He, Meilan; Witt, Colleen; Ye, Fengchun; Gao, Shou-Jiang","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05eae269e7bd3b7b841a84c02b1c13a670faf012.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3355089.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22615563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KSHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KSHV entry","KSHV infection","accumulation of KSHV particles","decreased KSHV infectivity","Ubiquitination","proteasome inhibition","inhibition of proteasome activity","endothelial cells","E3 ligase c-Cbl","intracellular trafficking","viral entry","internalization","cognate receptors integrin \u03B21","potential E3 ligase","enveloped herpesvirus","clathrin-mediated endocytosis","Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","diverse cellular functions","EEA1","cytoplasmic compartment","phosphorylation","nuclei","activated forms","post-translational modification","endosomal vesicles","analyses","ubiquitin-binding proteins epsin","endocytic transport of molecules","eps15","process","results","Knock"],"language":"en"},

This pathogen affects mostly young grapevines, but is also implicated in esca disease of older grapevines. Little is known about the disease cycle of this fungus. Infected propagation material was identified as a major means of dissemination of the pathogen. Recently, the pathogen was also detected from soil in South Africa and airborne conidia have been found in vineyards. The aim of this study was to use a molecular detection technique to test different samples collected from nurseries in South Africa at different nursery stages for the presence of P. chlamydospora. A one-tube nested-PCR technique was optimised for detecting P. chlamydospora in DNA extracted from soil, water, callusing medium and grapevine wood. The one-tube nested-PCR was sensitive enough to detect as little as 1 fg of P. chlamydospora genomic DNA from water and 10 fg from wood, callusing medium and soil. PCR analyses of the different nursery samples revealed the presence of several putative 360 bp P. chlamydospora specific bands. Subsequent sequence analyses and/or restriction enzyme digestions of all 360 bp PCR bands confirmed that all bands were P. chlamydospora specific, except for five bands obtained from callusing media and one from water. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora was positively detected in 25% of rootstock cane sections collected from mother blocks, 42% of rootstock cuttings and 16% of scion cuttings collected during grafting, 40% of water samples collected after pre-storage hydration, 67% of water samples collected during grafting, 8% of callusing medium samples and 17% of soil samples collected from mother blocks. These media can therefore be considered as possible inoculum sources of the pathogen during the nursery stages.","publish_time":"2006-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Retief, E.; McLeod, A.; Fourie, P.

APN is abundant in the kidneys and central nervous system. Identified substrates include Angiotensin III (Ang III); neuropeptides, including enkephalins and endorphins; and homones, including kallidan and somatostatin. It is developmentally expressed, a myelomonocytic marker for leukemias, and a receptor for coronovirus. There is evolving support for APN in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension. In rodent strains, intracerebraventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of APN reduces, while inhibitors of APN activity have a pressor effect on blood pressure. Dysregulation of central APN has been linked to the pathogenesis of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. There is evidence that renal tubule APN inhibits Na flux and plays a mechanistic role in salt-adaptation. A functional polymorphism of the ANP gene has been identified in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat. Signaling by APN impacting on blood pressure is likely mediated by regulation of the metabolism of Ang III to Ang IV. Whether APN regulates arterial blood pressure in humans or is a therapeutic target for hypertension are subjects for future exploration.","publish_time":"2007-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Danziger, Robert S.","journal":"Heart Fail Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dba2a2faaecf818e36becf94bf6e329577bac3f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozk4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang III","Ang IV"],"organizations":["Aminopeptidase N","APN","Angiotensin III","ANP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infusions of APN","APN impacting","Dysregulation of central APN","renal tubule APN","inhibitors of APN activity","regulation of arterial blood pressure","pathogenesis of hypertension","metabolism of Ang","Ang IV","salt-adaptation","Dahl salt-sensitive rat","hypertensive rat","central nervous system","integral membrane zinc-dependent metalloprotease","Na flux","conserved type","CD13","humans","pressor effect","mechanistic role","subjects","therapeutic target","kidneys","leukemias","homones","endorphins","M1 family of ectoenzymes","intracerebraventricular","evidence","ANP gene","future exploration","receptor","kallidan","functional polymorphism","enkephalins","neuropeptides","Aminopeptidase N","myelomonocytic marker","rodent strains","coronovirus","somatostatin","substrates","Angiotensin","support"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the full-length sequences of two KAA isoforms, KAA-1 and KAA-2, were elucidated by a combination of peptide mapping and complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning. They consisted of four internal tandem-repeated domains, which are conserved in high-mannose specific lectins from lower organisms, including a cyanobacterium Oscillatoria agardhii and a red alga Eucheuma serra. Using an Escherichia coli expression system, an active recombinant form of KAA-1 (His-tagged rKAA-1) was successfully generated in the yield of 115 mg per liter of culture. In a detailed oligosaccharide binding analysis by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method with 27 pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, His-tagged rKAA-1 and rKAA-1 specifically bound to high-mannose N-glycans with an exposed \u03B11-3 mannose in the D2 arm as the native lectin did. Predicted from oligosaccharide binding specificity, a surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the recombinants exhibit strong interaction with gp120, a heavily glycosylated envelope glycoprotein of HIV with high association constants (1.48 \u2212 1.61 \u00D7 10(9) M(\u22121)). Native KAAs and the recombinants inhibited the HIV-1 entry at IC(50)s of low nanomolar levels (7.3\u201312.9 nM). Thus, the recombinant proteins would be useful as antiviral reagents targeting the viral surface glycoproteins with high-mannose N-glycans, and the cultivated alga K. alvarezii could also be a good source of not only carrageenans but also this functional lectin(s).","publish_time":"2015-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hirayama, Makoto; Shibata, Hiromi; Imamura, Koji; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Hori, Kanji","journal":"Mar Biotechnol (NY)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7575ec6aa09493a4b856bdeccdccf263c3312ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozk5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high-mannose binding lectin KAA","high-mannose N-glycans","high-mannose specific lectins","KAA isoforms","rKAA","cultivated alga","native lectin","high association constants","active recombinant form of KAA","recombinants","detailed oligosaccharide binding analysis","oligosaccharide binding specificity","red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii","source of carrageenans","functional lectin","red alga Eucheuma serra","surface plasmon resonance analysis","recombinant proteins","good source","Native KAAs","viral surface glycoproteins","glycosylated envelope glycoprotein of HIV","s of low nanomolar levels","lower organisms","cyanobacterium Oscillatoria agardhii","antiviral reagents","centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method","complementary DNA","gp120","Escherichia coli expression system","cDNA","potent anti-influenza virus activity","exposed \u03B11","combination of peptide mapping","pyridylaminated oligosaccharides","full-length sequences","D2 arm","strong interaction","entry","internal tandem-repeated domains","cloning","nM","study","important species","liter of culture","yield"],"language":"en"},

To determine risk factors associated with the introduction of PRCV, a cross-sectional study of 408 Danish swine herds was carried out between May 1985 and June 1986. The association between herd-PRCV serological status and possible risk factors, obtained from a field questionnaire, was assessed by unconditional maximum likelihood logistic regression. An increasing herd size, location in the Jutland peninsula (compared with location on the island of Funen) (OR = 7.9 in a multivariable logistic regression model not including interaction terms), the presence of a slurry system (i.e. pigs living on a slatted floor) (OR = 4.6) and purchase of pigs (OR= 1.7) were significantly (P \u003C 0.05) associated with seropositivity. Two significant interactions, both involving herd size, were subsequently identified. The PRCV serological status of neighbouring herds was found to be related, and closeness of a seropositive herd was associated with an increased risk of a herd being serologically positive. The results of this study indicate that herd size may be an important determinant of airborne transmission of PRCV infection, and that herd size may modify the effect of other risk factors.","publish_time":"1995-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flori, J.; Mousing, J.; Gardner, I.; Willeberg, P.; Have, P.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7a071a777d517375a9eff5d145cfe54f58fd269.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016758779500498X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016758779500498X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRCV"],"locations":["Denmark","Jutland"],"keyphrases":["herd-PRCV serological status","increasing herd size","seropositive herd","introduction of PRCV","PRCV serological status of neighbouring herds","possible risk factors","increased risk","Abstract Serological screening of swine herds","location","Danish swine herds","important determinant of airborne transmission of PRCV infection","cross-sectional study","multivariable logistic regression model","purchase of pigs","unconditional maximum likelihood logistic regression","interaction terms","Jutland peninsula","presence","field questionnaire","porcine respiratory coronavirus","association","effect","significant interactions","slurry system","island of Funen","closeness","results","slatted floor","seropositivity","Denmark"],"language":"en"},

Using a recent survey of wildlife offered at wild meat markets in Malaysia as a basis, we review the literature to determine the potential zoonotic infection risks from hunting, butchering and consuming the species offered. We also determine which taxa potentially host the highest number of pathogens and discuss the significant disease risks from traded wildlife, considering how cultural practices influence zoonotic transmission. We identify 51 zoonotic pathogens (16 viruses, 19 bacteria and 16 parasites) potentially hosted by wildlife and describe the human health risks. The Suidae and the Cervidae families potentially host the highest number of pathogens. We conclude that there are substantial gaps in our knowledge of zoonotic pathogens and recommend performing microbial food safety risk assessments to assess the hazards of wild meat consumption. Overall, there may be considerable zoonotic risks to people involved in the hunting, butchering or consumption of wild meat in Southeast Asia, and these should be considered in public health strategies.

We first isolated a MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody that is reactive to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) glycoprotein. To increase stability, we introduced mutations into the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the antibody. In the HCDRs (excluding HCDR3) in this clone, two hydrophobic residues were replaced with Glu, two residues were replaced with Asp, and four residues were replaced with positively charged amino acids. In LCDRs, only two Leu residues were replaced with Val. These modifications successfully generated a clone with significantly greater stability and equivalent reactivity and neutralizing activity following nebulization compared to the original clone.

Among 10 categories of IDTEs, foodborne and waterborne IDTEs were the most common, vaccine\u2010preventable IDTEs caused the highest number of cases, and airborne IDTEs caused the most deaths. Observed drivers for each IDTE were sorted into three main groups: globalization and environmental drivers contributed to 61% of all IDTEs, public health system drivers contributed to 21%, and social and demographic drivers to 18%. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that four of the top five drivers for observed IDTEs were in the globalization and environment group. In the observational study, the globalization and environment group was related to all IDTE categories, but only to five of eight categories in the foresight study. Directly targeting these drivers with public health interventions may diminish the chances of IDTE occurrence from the outset.","publish_time":"2016-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Semenza, Jan C.; Rockl\u00F6v, Joacim; Penttinen, Pasi; Lindgren, Elisabet","journal":"Ann N Y Acad Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f57d67f89e28a11e3c7270884e392999c3973088.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167773.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27434370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECDC","IDTE"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["categories of IDTEs","airborne IDTEs","preventable IDTEs","waterborne IDTEs","environmental drivers","demographic drivers","drivers of disease emergence","ECDC foresight study of projected drivers of future IDTEs","public health system drivers","globalization","IDTE categories","Disease Prevention","observational study","environment group","observed results","infectious disease threat events","public health interventions","chances of IDTE occurrence","Emerging infectious diseases","European Centre","highest number of cases","international concern","Control","vaccine","main groups","epidemic intelligence","multiple logistic regression analysis","potential","outset","pandemics","impact","deaths"],"language":"en"},

In the early phase, Day 1 to Day 7, a retinal vasculitis is noted which is associated with the presence of viral proteins and infectious virus. In the late phase, Day 10 to Day 140, a retinal degeneration is associated with the absence of viral proteins, infectious virus, and inflammatory cells. The purpose of this study was to determine if viral RNA persists within the retina during the retinal degenerative phase of the disease. BALB/c mice were inoculated by the intravitreal route with 104.0TCID50/5 \u03BCl of virus. The presence of viral RNA was detected byin situhybridization with a viral cDNA probe and viral proteins were identified by immunocytochemical staining. During the acute phase of the infection, viral RNA was found in the retina, RPE, ciliary body epithelium, and the iris epithelium. During the late phase of the infection, viral RNA was almost exclusively found within the retina and RPE and not in the anterior segment of the eye. Within the retina, viral RNA was detected in the ganglion cell layer, the inner retina, the outer retina, and the RPE cell. Immunocytochemical staining identified viral protein within the retina only from Day 1 to Day 8. This ocular disease was also associated with a persistent systemic infection. Both viral RNA and viral proteins were identified within the liver during the first 8 days. However, only viral RNA was detected in the liver from Day 8 to Day 60. These studies demonstrate that MHV established an acute infection (Day 1\u20138) where infectious virus and viral proteins were identified. This was followed by a persistent infection within the retina and liver where only viral RNA were detected byin situhybridization.","publish_time":"1996-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Komurasaki, Yusuke; Nagineni, Chandrasekharam N.; Wang, Yun; Hooks, John J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08d735bb53c3af46320aad799286c81a44606d86.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682296904420; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682296904420","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","RPE","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of viral RNA","presence of viral proteins","absence of viral proteins","viral cDNA probe","inner retina","outer retina","infectious virus","acute phase","late phase","acute infection","persistent infection","retinal degenerative phase","\u03BCl of virus","liver","early phase","biphasic retinal disease","persistent systemic infection","retinal degeneration","retinal vasculitis","RPE cell","mouse hepatitis virus","MHV","byin situhybridization","c mice","ocular disease","immunocytochemical staining","adult BALB","iris epithelium","ciliary body epithelium","ganglion cell layer","JHM strain","murine coronavirus","0TCID50","intravitreal route","inflammatory cells","anterior segment","study","eye","studies","purpose","days"],"language":"en"},

Virus\u2010derived nucleic acids are sensed by the retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I)\u2010like receptor (RLR) family and the toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) family as well as the DNA sensor cyclic GMP\u2010AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS). These receptors activate IRF3/7 and NF\u2010\u03BAB signaling pathways to induce the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines firing antiviral responses within the cell. However, to achieve a favorable outcome for the host, a balanced production of IFNs and activation of antiviral responses is required. Post\u2010translational modifications (PTMs), such as the covalent linkage of functional groups to amino acid chains, are crucial for this immune homeostasis in antiviral responses. Canonical PTMs including phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been extensively studied and other PTMs such as methylation, acetylation, SUMOylation, ADP\u2010ribosylation and glutamylation are being increasingly implicated in antiviral innate immunity. Here we summarize our recent understanding of the most important PTMs regulating the antiviral innate immune response, and their role in virus\u2010related immune pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2017-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yilong; He, Chenxi; Wang, Lin; Ge, Baoxue","journal":"Eur J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33538ad82c9f74e08f76364611e35e76f2d562e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163624.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28744851/; https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201746959","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Canonical"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune responses","antiviral innate immune response","activation of antiviral responses","immune homeostasis","innate immune system","antiviral innate immunity","important PTMs","Canonical PTMs","virus\u2010related immune pathogenesis","family","retinoic acid","recognition receptors","amino acid chains","balanced production of IFNs","pattern","cGAMP","role","DNA sensor cyclic GMP","covalent linkage of functional groups","SUMOylation","ADP","host","acetylation","cytokines","expression of type","\u03BAB","pathways","ribosylation","synthase","derived nucleic acids","NF","inducible gene","interferons","methylation","toll","RIG","glutamylation","cGAS","IRF3","PRR","phosphorylation","ubiquitination","Post\u2010translational modifications","recent understanding"],"language":"en"},

In particular, maturation of the gastrointestinal tract in a new environment loaded with potential pathogens, which can predispose neonatal calves to develop diarrhea, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during the first 4 wks of life. We aimed to investigate the inflammatory adaptations at a transcriptomic level in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to a mild diarrhea in neonatal dairy calves using RNA isolated from fresh fecal samples. Eight newborn Jersey male calves were used from birth to 5 wks of age and housed in individual pens. After birth, calves received 1.9 L of colostrum from their respective dams. Calves had ad-libitum access to water and starter grain (22% CP) and were fed twice daily a total of 5.6 L pasteurized whole milk. Starter intake, body weight (BW), fecal score, withers height (WH), and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded throughout the experiment. Blood samples were collected weekly for metabolic and inflammatory profiling from wk 0 to wk 5. Fresh fecal samples were collected weekly and immediately flash frozen until RNA was extracted using a Trizol-based method, and subsequently, an RT-qPCR analysis was performed. Orthogonal contrasts were used to evaluate linear or quadratic effects over time. Starter intake, BW, and WH increased over time. Fecal score was greatest (2.6 \u00B1 0.3) during wk 2. The concentrations of IL-6, ceruloplasmin, and haptoglobin had a positive quadratic effect with maximal concentrations during wk 2, which corresponded to the maximal fecal score observed during the same time. The concentration of serum amyloid A decreased over time. The mRNA expression of the proinflammatory related genes TLR4, TNFA, IL8, and IL1B had a positive quadratic effect of time. A time effect was observed for the cell membrane sodium-dependent glucose transporter SLC5A1, for the major carbohydrate facilitated transporter SLC2A2, and water transport function AQP3, where SLC5A1 and AQP3 had a negative quadratic effect over time. Our data support the use of the fecal RNA as a noninvasive tool to investigate intestinal transcriptomic profiling of dairy calves experiencing diarrhea, which would be advantageous for future research including nutritional effects and health conditions.","publish_time":"2018-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosa, Fernanda; Busato, Sebastiano; Avaroma, Fatima C.; Linville, Kali; Trevisi, Erminio; Osorio, Johan S.; Bionaz, Massimo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbf9753177215fea032ae9f8193ce6a0380876e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5786293.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0191599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29373601/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","Orthogonal"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["time effect","fecal RNA","positive quadratic effect of time","neonatal calves","maximal fecal score","fresh fecal samples","neonatal dairy calves","quadratic effects","negative quadratic effect","birth","intestinal transcriptomic profiling of dairy calves","Starter intake","newborn Jersey male calves","mild diarrhea","BW","inflammatory profiling","WH","gastrointestinal tract","starter grain","maximal concentrations","Blood samples","wks of life","transporter SLC2A2","water transport function AQP3","transcriptomic level","major carbohydrate","nutritional effects","inflammatory adaptations","wks of age","concentrations of IL","extrauterine life","newborn calf","major cause of morbidity","RT-qPCR analysis","cell membrane sodium-dependent glucose transporter SLC5A1","proinflammatory related genes TLR4","TNFA","IL8","noninvasive tool","future research","body weight","ad-libitum access","new environment","IL1B","withers height","mRNA expression","health conditions","potential pathogens","mortality","ceruloplasmin","haptoglobin","rectal temperature","physiological changes","maturation","colostrum","Trizol-based method","concentration of serum amyloid","individual pens","respective dams","Orthogonal contrasts","CP","data","total","milk","experiment"],"language":"en"},

The objective was to assess the etiology and factors associated with community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized children \u003C5 years of age in Mali. METHODS: A prospective hospital-based case-control study was implemented in the Pediatric department of Gabriel Tour\u00E9 University Hospital at Bamako, Mali, between July 2011-December 2012. Cases were children with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia; Controls were hospitalized children without respiratory features, matched for age and period. Respiratory specimens, were collected to identify 19 viruses and 5 bacteria. Whole blood was collected from cases only. Factors associated with pneumonia were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 118 cases and 98 controls were analyzed; 44.1% were female, median age was 11 months. Among pneumonia cases, 30.5% were hypoxemic at admission, mortality was 4.2%. Pneumonia cases differed from the controls regarding clinical signs and symptoms but not in terms of past medical history. Multivariate analysis of nasal swab findings disclosed that S. pneumoniae (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.6\u20137.0), human metapneumovirus (aOR = 17.2, 95% CI: 2.0\u2013151.4), respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] (aOR = 7.4, 95% CI: 2.3\u201323.3), and influenza A virus (aOR = 10.7, 95% CI: 1.0\u2013112.2) were associated with pneumonia, independently of patient age, gender, period, and other pathogens. Distribution of S. pneumoniae and RSV differed by season with higher rates of S. pneumoniae in January-June and of RSV in July-September. Pneumococcal serotypes 1 and 5 were more frequent in pneumonia cases than in the controls (P = 0.009, and P = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this non-PCV population from Mali, pneumonia in children was mainly attributed to S. pneumoniae, RSV, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A virus.

The aim of this study was to use conventional and molecular detection methods to assess the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in children less than five years of age that were hospitalized with ALRTIs. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the occurrence of respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytisl virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza virus A and B (IFV-A and B), parainfluenzavirus 1, 2, 3 and 4 (PIV 1, 2, 3 and 4), human rhinoviruses (HRV), human enterovirus (HEV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E and OC43, human bocavirus (HBoV) and human adenovirus (HAdV) in hospitalized children with ALRTIs, at Hospital Serdang, Malaysia, from June 16 to December 21, 2009. The study was also designed in part to assess the performance of the conventional methods against molecular methods. RESULTS: Viral pathogens were detected in 158 (95.8%) of the patients. Single virus infections were detected in 114 (67.9%) patients; 46 (27.9%) were co-infected with different viruses including double-virus infections in 37 (22.4%) and triple-virus infections in 9 (5.5%) cases. Approximately 70% of samples were found to be positive using conventional methods compared with 96% using molecular methods. A wide range of respiratory viruses were detected in the study. There was a high prevalence of RSV (50.3%) infections, particularly group B viruses.

In the current study, a reverse genetic approach was used to define the role of the 28-kDa amino-terminal product (nsp1) of the gene 1 polyprotein during replication of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in cell culture. To determine whether nsp1 is required for MHV replication and to identify residues critical for protein function, mutant viruses that contained deletions or point mutations within the nsp1-coding region were generated and assayed for defects in viral replication, viral protein expression, protein localization, and RNA synthesis. The results demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 (residues K124 through L241) was dispensable for virus replication in culture but was required for efficient proteolytic cleavage of nsp1 from the gene 1 polyprotein and for optimal viral replication. Furthermore, whereas deletion of nsp1 residues amino-terminal to K124 failed to produce infectious virus, point mutagenesis of the nsp1 amino-terminus allowed recovery of several mutants with altered replication and RNA synthesis. This study identifies nsp1 residues important for protein processing, viral RNA synthesis, and viral replication.","publish_time":"2005-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brockway, Sarah M.; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b067a208058f1edd575cb8c0c6726674bd66af50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111834.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205003776; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205003776","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimal viral replication","MHV replication","altered replication","nsp1 residues important","viral RNA synthesis","nsp1 amino-terminus","deletion of nsp1 residues amino-terminal","viral protein expression","mechanisms of coronavirus replication","nsp1-coding region","carboxy-terminal half of nsp1","residues K124","efficient proteolytic cleavage of nsp1","viral nonstructural proteins","protein processing","protein function","protein localization","residues critical","kDa amino-terminal product","polyprotein","infectious virus","coronavirus murine hepatitis virus","current study","cell culture","mutant viruses","mutants","functions","recovery","L241","mutations","deletions","ongoing research","mutagenesis","defects","reverse genetic approach","nsps","Abstract","role","results"],"language":"en"},

The SFTSV glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, facilitate viral entry into host cells. Gn and Gc are generated from a precursor protein, Gn/Gc, but it is currently unknown how the precursor is converted into the single proteins and whether this process is required for viral infectivity. Employing a rhabdoviral pseudotyping system, we demonstrate that a predicted signal sequence at the N-terminus of Gc is required for Gn/Gc processing and viral infectivity while potential proprotein convertase cleavage sites in Gc are dispensable. Moreover, we show that expression of Gn or Gc alone is not sufficient for host cell entry while particles bearing both proteins are infectious, and we provide evidence that Gn facilitates Golgi transport and virion incorporation of Gc. Collectively, these results suggest that signal peptidase liberates mature Gc from the Gn/Gc precursor and that this process is essential for viral infectivity and thus constitutes a potential target for antiviral intervention.","publish_time":"2016-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plegge, Teresa; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Spiegel, Martin; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc65afbab3c952058f9261b012cdc4407a9d264c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5113920.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27855227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Gn/Gc"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Gc precursor","mature Gc","Gc processing","virion incorporation of Gc","expression of Gn","viral infectivity","viral entry","precursor protein","host cell entry","potential target","signal peptidase","host cells","SFTSV glycoproteins","single proteins","predicted signal sequence","potential proprotein convertase cleavage sites","particles","Golgi transport","thrombocytopenia syndrome virus","N-terminus","severe fever","antivirals","evidence","pathogenic bunyavirus","vaccines","antiviral intervention","results","rhabdoviral pseudotyping system"],"language":"en"},

Such facilities were essential for the management of highly contagious patients during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks and the more recent 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Many different types of door designs are used in the construction of such isolation rooms, which may be related to the space available and affordability. Using colored food dye as a tracer, the qualitative effects of door-opening motions on the dissemination of potentially contaminated air into and out of a single isolation room were visualized and filmed using Reynolds-number-equivalent, small-scale, water-tank models fitted with programmable door-opening and moving human figure motions. Careful scaling considerations involved in the design and construction of these water-tank models enabled these results to be accurately extrapolated to the full-scale situation. Four simple types of door design were tested: variable speed single and double, sliding and hinged doors, in combination with the moving human figure. The resulting video footage was edited, synchronized and presented in a series of split-screen formats. From these experiments, it is clear that double-hinged doors pose the greatest risk of leakage into or out of the room, followed by (in order of decreasing risk) single-hinged, double-sliding and single-sliding doors. The relative effect of the moving human figure on spreading any potential contamination was greatest with the sliding doors, as the bulk airflows induced were large relative to those resulting from these door-opening motions. However, with the hinged doors, the airflows induced by these door-opening motions were significantly greater. Further experiments involving a simulated ventilated environment are required, but from these findings alone, it appears that sliding-doors are far more effective for hospital isolation room containment.","publish_time":"2013-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Julian W.; Nicolle, Andre; Pantelic, Jovan; Klettner, Christian A.; Su, Ruikun; Kalliomaki, Petri; Saarinen, Pekka; Koskela, Hannu; Reijula, Kari; Mustakallio, Panu; Cheong, David K.

Recent studies suggest that toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, and that the reason for corticosteroid therapy for inflammatory diseases is related to the anti-inflammatory activities of corticosteroids through the reduction of NF-\u03BAB. We hypothesized that the administration of TLR ligands in combination with corticosteroid causes ONFH and that transcription factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of ONFH. The aim of the study was to evaluate (1) the incidence of ONFH in rats after the administration of TLR7 or TLR9 ligands together with methylprednisolone (MPSL) and (2) whether transcription factors contribute to the development of ONFH. Male Wistar rats (n=148) were divided into five groups as follows: Group 1: Saline\u002BMPSL, Group 2: Imiquimod\u002BSaline, Group 3: Imiquimod\u002BMPSL, Group 4: CpG-C\u002BMPSL, Group 5: Imiquimod\u002BBAY11-7082\u002BMPSL. As a result, ONFH was observed in 0 of 12 rats in Group 1, in 1 of 10 in Group 2, in 6 of 12 in Group 3, in 4 of 12 in Group 4, in 0 of 9 in Group 5. MPSL treatment did not significantly affect IRF7 activity, whereas NF-\u03BAB activity was significantly repressed in Group 2 and Group 3. Furthermore, the repression in interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) activity by BAY11-7082 interfered with the development of ONFH simultaneously with the MPSL treatment-induced repression in NF-\u03BAB activity. In conclusion, in the present study, corticosteroid treatment after the administration of TLR7 or TLR9 ligands caused ONFH. Repression in NF-\u03BAB activity by corticosteroid treatment boosted the development of ONFH.","publish_time":"2014-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Okazaki, Shunichiro; Nagoya, Satoshi; Matsumoto, Hiroshi; Mizuo, Keisuke; Sasaki, Mikito; Watanabe, Satoshi; Yamashita, Toshihiko; Inoue, Hiromasa","journal":"Lab Invest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76180154361a79a8f1c6fcad7d8408118ac40b04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100527.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25384124/; https://doi.org/10.1038/labinvest.2014.134","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Imiquimod"],"organizations":["ONFH","Group","MPSL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of ONFH","pathogenesis of ONFH","incidence of ONFH","corticosteroid treatment","NF-\u03BAB activity","MPSL treatment-induced repression","corticosteroid therapy","IRF7 activity","Imiquimod","administration of TLR ligands","pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases","administration of TLR7","reduction of NF","TLR9 ligands","Saline","transcription factors","BAY11","Male Wistar rats","present study","reason","femoral head","combination","interferon regulatory factor","Non-traumatic osteonecrosis","anti-inflammatory activities of corticosteroids","CpG-C","toll","methylprednisolone","patients","receptor","Recent studies","conclusion","aim","result","groups"],"language":"en"},

As such, a rapid test that can accurately detect ASFV on-site is important to the timely implementation of control measures. In this study, we developed a rapid test that combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) of the ASFV p72 gene with lateral flow detection (LFD). Results showed that the sensitivity of recombinase polymerase amplification with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) for ASFV was 150 copies per reaction within 10 min at 38\u00B0C. The assay was highly specific to ASFV and had no cross-reactions with other porcine viruses, including classical swine fever virus (CSFV). A total of 145 field samples were examined using our method, and the agreement of the positive rate between RPA-LFD (10/145) and real-time PCR (10/145) was 100%.

Evidence from animal models shows that T cells can provide heterosubtypic protection and are crucial for immune control of influenza virus infections. This has provided hope for the design of a universal vaccine able to prime against diverse influenza virus strains and subtypes. However, multiple hurdles exist for the realisation of a universal T cell vaccine. Overall primary concerns are: extrapolating human clinical studies, seeding durable effective T cell resident memory (Trm), population human leucocyte antigen (HLA) coverage, and the potential for T cell-mediated immune escape. Further comprehensive human clinical data is needed during natural infection to validate the protective role T cells play during infection in the absence of antibodies. Furthermore, fundamental questions still exist regarding the site, longevity and duration, quantity, and phenotype of T cells needed for optimal protection. Standardised experimental methods, and eventually simplified commercial assays, to assess peripheral influenza-specific T cell responses are needed for larger-scale clinical studies of T cells as a correlate of protection against influenza infection. The design and implementation of a T cell-inducing vaccine will require a consensus on the level of protection acceptable in the community, which may not provide sterilizing immunity but could protect the individual from severe disease, reduce the length of infection, and potentially reduce transmission in the community. Therefore, increasing the standard of care potentially offered by T cell vaccines should be considered in the context of pandemic preparedness and zoonotic infections, and in combination with improved antibody vaccine targeting methods. Current pandemic vaccine preparedness measures and ongoing clinical trials under-utilise T cell-inducing vaccines, reflecting the myriad questions that remain about how, when, where, and which T cells are needed to fight influenza virus infection. This review aims to bring together basic fundamentals of T cell biology with human clinical data, which need to be considered for the implementation of a universal vaccine against influenza that harnesses the power of T cells.","publish_time":"2018-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clemens, E.

New classification criteria for childhood vasculitis have recently been proposed and are currently undergoing validation. Epidemiological clues continue to implicate infectious triggers in Kawasaki Disease and Henoch Sch\u00F6nlein purpura. Several genetic polymorphisms have now been described in the vasculitides that may be relevant in terms of disease predisposition or development of disease complications. Treatment regimens continue to improve, with the use of different immunosuppressive medications and newer therapeutic approaches such as biologic agents. However new challenges are looming in regards to the role of inflammation in endothelial health and the long term cardiovascular morbidity for children with primary systemic vasculitis.

The initiation of RSV infection of immortalized cells is largely dependent on cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), a receptor for the RSV attachment (G) glycoprotein in immortalized cells. However, RSV infects the ciliated cells in primary well differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures via the apical surface, but HS is not detectable on this surface. Here we show that soluble HS inhibits infection of immortalized cells, but not HAE cultures, confirming that HS is not the receptor on HAE cultures. Conversely, a \u201Cnon-neutralizing\u201D monoclonal antibody against the G protein that does not block RSV infection of immortalized cells, does inhibit infection of HAE cultures. This antibody was previously shown to block the interaction between the G protein and the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 and we have mapped the binding site for this antibody to the CX3C motif and its surrounding region in the G protein. We show that CX3CR1 is present on the apical surface of ciliated cells in HAE cultures and especially on the cilia. RSV infection of HAE cultures is reduced by an antibody against CX3CR1 and by mutations in the G protein CX3C motif. Additionally, mice lacking CX3CR1 are less susceptible to RSV infection. These findings demonstrate that RSV uses CX3CR1 as a cellular receptor on HAE cultures and highlight the importance of using a physiologically relevant model to study virus entry and antibody neutralization.","publish_time":"2015-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Sara M.; McNally, Beth A.; Ioannidis, Ioannis; Flano, Emilio; Teng, Michael N.; Oomens, Antonius G.; Walsh, Edward E.; Peeples, Mark E.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e88797458f110553b9418007d35401975dce1454.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4676609.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658574/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005318","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","HS","HAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV infection of HAE cultures","initiation of RSV infection of immortalized cells","RSV attachment","apical surface of ciliated cells","chemokine receptor CX3CR1","G protein CX3C motif","monoclonal antibody","antibody neutralization","cellular receptor","soluble HS","cell surface heparan sulfate","Respiratory syncytial virus","study virus entry","frequent cause of lower respiratory disease","primary","differentiated human airway epithelial","infants","mutations","relevant model","vaccine","surrounding region","glycoprotein","importance","effective therapy","non-neutralizing","binding site","mice","interaction","findings"],"language":"en"},

In spite of this, investigations of the molecular pathogenesis for many HCPs have been limited to gross pathological changes in animal models or global analysis of gene expression. Further, questions remain regarding the ability of animal models of disease to recapitulate human molecular pathogenesis or act as predictors of therapeutic efficacy. Thus, it is likely that medical countermeasure development for HCPs will rely on identifying therapeutic targets that are uniquely modulated during HCP infection. It is also appreciated that many cellular processes can be regulated independently of changes in transcription or translation through phosphorylation events. Cellular kinases, individually or collectively (the kinome), play critical roles in regulating complex biology, underlie various malignancies, and represent high-priority drug targets. The growing interest in kinases in both basic and translational research has driven efforts to develop technologies that enable characterization of phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction. To this end, enhanced technical capabilities at the IRF-Frederick provide the unique capability for characterizing host responses to HCP insult during the course of infection and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.","publish_time":"2014-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kindrachuk, Jason; Falcinelli, Shane; Wada, Jiro; Kuhn, Jens H.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Jahrling, Peter B.","journal":"Pathogens and Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea19a16c3602fd79357f1a0599252e3656495fff.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3f9823a9e8601925e3a1e5c0509accc0b740c43e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6136422.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/femspd/article-pdf/71/2/190/17943182/71-2-190.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1111/2049-632x.12163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585711/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCPs","therapeutic targets","human molecular pathogenesis","HCP infection","novel targets","therapeutic intervention","Cellular kinases","high-priority drug targets","predictors of therapeutic efficacy","ability of animal models of disease","characterization of phosphorylation","HCP insult","course of infection","phosphorylation events","cellular processes","gross pathological changes","high-consequence pathogens","characterizing host responses","unique capability","IRF-Frederick","global analysis of gene expression","complex biology","efforts","threats","translational research","various malignancies","critical roles","technical capabilities","mediated signal transduction","technologies","medical countermeasure development","transcription","international public health","investigations","paucity of information","kinome","end","questions","spite"],"language":"en"},

Envelope protein E-mediated BST2 downregulation appears to undergo lysosomal degradation pathway. Additional study revealed that the transmembrane domain and the coiled-coil domain (CC) of BST2 are the target domains of viral protein E and that the N- and C-terminal membrane anchors and the CC domain of BST2 are essential for blocking JEV release. Our results together indicate that the release of enveloped viruses whose budding take place in an intracellular compartment can be restricted by BST2.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Mei; Wang, Ping; Zheng, Zifeng; Hu, Kai; Zhang, Mudan; Guan, Xinmeng; Fu, Ming; Zhang, Di; Wang, Wei; Xiao, Gengfu; Hu, Qinxue; Liu, Yalan","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6df6c727033e287c0d7cd1bc277f071868608d71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111294.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.07.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217302209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710958/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217302209","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BST2 expression","CC domain of BST2","release of enveloped viruses","Envelope protein E-mediated BST2 downregulation","blocking JEV release","JEV envelope protein E","JEV infection","target domains of viral protein E","transmembrane domain","budding","release of Japanese encephalitis virus","viral components","coiled-coil domain","intracellular compartment","cell membrane","secretory pathway","lysosomal degradation pathway","C-terminal membrane anchors","ER-Golgi intermediate compartment","turn","produced virions","place","auxiliary role","Additional study","process","results"],"language":"en"},

Currently, the viruses virulence determinants and host gene expressions during FIPV infection are not fully understood. METHODS: RNA sequencing of Crandell Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells, infected with FIPV strain 79\u20131146 at 3 hours post infection (h.p.i), were sequenced using the Illumina next generation sequencing approach. Bioinformatic\u2019s analysis, based on Felis catus 2X annotated shotgun reference genome, using CLC bio Genome Workbench mapped both control and infected cell reads to 18899 genes out of 19046 annotated genes. Kal\u2019s Z test statistical analysis was used to analyse the differentially expressed genes from the infected CRFK cells. Real time RT-qPCR was developed for further transcriptional profiling of three genes (PD-1, PD-L1 and A3H) in infected CRFK cells and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from healthy and FIP-diseased cats. RESULTS: Based on Kal\u2019s Z-test, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) \u003C0.05 and \u003E1.99 fold change on gene expressions, a total of 61 genes were differentially expressed by both samples, where 44 genes were up-regulated and the remainder were down-regulated. Most genes were closely clustered together, suggesting a homogeneous expression. The majority of the genes that were significantly regulated, were those associated with monocytes-macrophage and Th1 cell functions, and the regulation of apoptosis. Real time RT-qPCR developed focusing on 2 up-regulated genes (PD-L1 and A3H) together with an apoptosis associated gene PD-1 expressions in FIPV infected CRFK cells and in PBMCs from healthy and FIP diagnosed cats produced concordant results with transcriptome data. CONCLUSION: The possible roles of these genes, and their importance in feline coronaviruses infection, are discussed.","publish_time":"2013-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harun, Mohammad Syamsul Reza; Kuan, Choong Oi; Selvarajah, Gayathri Thevi; Wei, Tan Sheau; Arshad, Siti Suri; Bejo, Mohd Hair; Omar, Abdul Rahman","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4b76917de146cdbe4c922c15ac3d87d3d483446.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3829811.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24209771/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kal"],"organizations":["Feline Enteric Coronavirus","FIPV","Crandell Rees Feline Kidney","Illumina","Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulated genes","annotated genes","FIPV infected CRFK cells","gene PD","infected cell","FIPV infection","PD-L1","feline coronaviruses infection","FIP Virus","FIPV strain","host gene expressions","FIP-diseased cats","PBMCs","Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells","Feline Infectious Peritonitis","Kal\u2019s Z-test","A3H","Real time RT-qPCR","Kal\u2019s Z test statistical analysis","RNA sequencing of Crandell Rees Feline Kidney","virulent mutant of Feline Enteric Coronavirus","annotated shotgun reference genome","concordant results","Bioinformatic\u2019s analysis","regulation of apoptosis","Th1 cell functions","generation sequencing approach","CLC bio Genome Workbench","Felis catus","control","viruses virulence determinants","False Discovery Rate","lethal systemic disease","monocytes-macrophage","METHODS","hours","FECV","transcriptome data","BACKGROUND","transcriptional profiling","total","importance","fold change","FDR","Illumina","possible roles","CONCLUSION","samples","homogeneous expression","majority","remainder"],"language":"en"},

The biological relevance of amino peptidase N (ANPEP) as a putative receptor for TGEV and PEDV in pigs was evaluated by using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit exon 2 of ANPEP resulting in a premature stop codon. Knockout pigs possessing the null ANPEP phenotype and age matched wild type pigs were challenged with either PEDV or TGEV. Fecal swabs were collected daily from each animal beginning 1 day prior to challenge with PEDV until the termination of the study. The presence of virus nucleic acid was determined by PCR. ANPEP null pigs did not support infection with TGEV, but retained susceptibility to infection with PEDV. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of PEDV reactivity and absence of TGEV reactivity in the enterocytes lining the ileum in ANPEP null pigs. The different receptor requirements for TGEV and PEDV have important implications in the development of new genetic tools for the control of enteric disease in pigs.

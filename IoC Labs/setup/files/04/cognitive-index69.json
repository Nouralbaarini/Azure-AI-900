Objectives To characterize complete SARS-CoV S-gene sequences from Hong Kong. Study design Fifty-six SARS-CoV S-gene sequences, obtained from patients who presented with SARS to the Prince of Wales Hospital during March\u2013May 2003, were analysed using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, together with 138 other (both human and animal) S-gene sequences downloaded from GenBank. Results The maximum-likelihood (ML) trees showed little evolution occurring within these 56 sequences. Analysis with the other sequences, showed three distinct SARS clusters, closely correlated to previously defined early, middle and late phases of the 2003 international SARS outbreaks. In addition, two new single nucleotide variations (SNVs), T21615A and T21901A, were discovered, not previously reported elsewhere. Conclusions The ML approach to the reconstruction of tree phylogenies is known to be superior to the more popular, less computationally and time-demanding neighbour-joining (NJ) approach. The ML analysis in this study confirms the previously reported SARS epidemiology analysed mostly using the NJ approach. The two new SNVs reported here are most likely due to the tissue-culture passaging of the clinical samples.","publish_time":"2007-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Julian W.; Cheung, Jo L.K.; Chu, Ida M.T.; Ip, Margaret; Hui, Mamie; Peiris, Malik; Chan, Paul K.S.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4185f72f8808fa0c927ce358267368866cfa2eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108452.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653206003738; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653206003738","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","GenBank"],"locations":["Hong Kong","Prince of Wales Hospital"],"keyphrases":["reported SARS epidemiology","complete SARS-CoV S-gene sequences","international SARS outbreaks","distinct SARS clusters","NJ approach","new SNVs","maximum likelihood","maximum-likelihood","Analysis","molecular epidemiology","Study design","new single nucleotide variations","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","late phases","spike glycoprotein","Hong Kong","T21615A","addition","reconstruction of tree phylogenies","trees","Abstract Background","animal","tissue-culture","little evolution","time-demanding neighbour","Prince of Wales Hospital","Objectives","GenBank","patients","clinical samples","T21901A","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Since its launch in 2017, CEPI has mobilized more than US$750 million to support its mission to develop vaccines against agents such as Lassa virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Nipah virus, as well as several rapid-response vaccine platforms to accelerate response times to unexpected epidemic threats. CEPI has also played a leading role in fostering institutional partnerships between public- and private-sector organizations to optimize allocation of resources for vaccine development against its priority pathogens. CEPI\u2019s priorities include diversification of its current vaccine research and development investment portfolio to include additional pathogens, such as Rift Valley fever and chikungunya; establishment of technical and regulatory pathways for vaccine development across CEPI\u2019s portfolio; development of sustainable manufacturing solutions for vaccine candidates nearing completion of safety and immunogenicity testing in humans; and creation of investigational stockpiles of its vaccine candidates for use in emergency situations.

Prevalent views associate viruses and disease. Yet many viruses establish species-specific persistent, inapparent infections that are stable on an evolutionary time scale.

Little is known about the public awareness toward the nature or prevention of the disease. The aim of this work was to assess the knowledge of the adult population in Riyadh toward the MERS-CoV. In this cross-sectional survey, a self-administrated questionnaire was distributed to randomly selected participants visiting malls in Riyadh. The questionnaire contained measurable epidemiological and clinical MERS-CoV knowledge level variables and relevant source of information. The study included 676 participants. Mean age was 32.5 (\u00B1SD 8.6) years and 353 (47.8%) were males. Almost all participants heard about the corona disease and causative agent. The study showed a fair overall knowledge (66.0%), less knowledge on epidemiological features of the disease (58.3%), and good knowledge (90.7%) on the clinical manifestation of the MERS-CoV. Internet was the major (89.0%) source of disease information, and other sources including health care providers, SMS, television, magazines and books were low rated (all \u003C25%).

Necropsy performed on three puppies revealed an enteritis reminiscent of canine parvovirus associated enteritis, accompanied with signs of lymphocytolytic disease in bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and thymus. While other major causes of enteritis of young dogs, including canine parvovirus, were excluded, by random PCR in combination with next-generation sequencing, a novel CaBoV-2 strain was detected. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome of this novel canine bocavirus strain indicated that this virus was indeed most closely related to group 2 canine bocaviruses. Infection with canine bocavirus was confirmed by in situ hybridization, which revealed the presence of CaBoV-2 nucleic acid in the intestinal tract and lymphoid tissues of the dogs. In a small-scale retrospective analysis concerning the role of CaBoV-2 no additional cases were identified.

More clinical investigations are needed. Objective The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and therapeutic methods of COVID-19 patients in Hunan, China. Setting The First Hospital of Changsha, First People\u2019s Hospital of Huaihua, and the Central Hospital of Loudi, Hunan province, China. Methods This was a retrospective multi-center case-series analysis. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis hospitalized at the study centers from January 17 to February 10, 2020, were included. The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. Main outcome measure Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatments. Results A total of 54 patients were included (51 had the common-type COVID-19, three had the severe-type), the median age was 41, and 52% of them were men. The median time from the first symptoms to hospital admission was seven days. Among patients with the common-type COVID-19, the median length of stay was nine days, and 21 days among patients with severe COVID-19. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (74.5%), cough (56.9%), and fatigue (43.1%) among patients in the common-type group. Fourteen patients (37.8%) had a reduced WBC count, 23 (62.2%) had reduced eosinophil ratio, and 21 (56.76%) had decreased eosinophil count. The most common patterns on chest-computed tomography were ground-glass opacity (52.2%) and patchy bilateral shadowing (73.9%). Pharmacotherapy included recombinant human interferon \u03B12b, lopinavir/ritonavir, novaferon, antibiotics, systematic corticosteroids and traditional Chinese medicine prescription. The outcome of treatment indicated that in patients with the common-type COVID-19, interferon-\u03B12b, but not novaferon, had some benefits, antibiotics treatment was not needed, and corticosteroids should be used cautiously. Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter. We observed some treatment benefits with interferon-\u03B12b and corticosteroid therapies but not with novaferon and antibiotic treatment in our study population.

However, the underlying mechanisms used by the NS1 C-terminal effector domain (ED) to inhibit the activation of IFN-\u03B2 pathway are not well understood. In this study, we used influenza virus subtype of H5N1 to demonstrate that the NS1 C-terminal ED but not the N-terminal RNA-binding domain, binds TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). This results in an attenuation of the type I IFN signaling pathway. We found that the NS1 C-terminal ED (named NS1/126-225) inhibits the active caspase activation and recruitment domain-containing form of RIG-I [RIG-I(N)]-induced IFN-\u03B2 reporter activity, the phosphorylation of IRF3, and the induction of IFN-\u03B2. Further analysis showed that NS1/126-225 binds to TRAF3 through the TRAF domain, subsequently decreasing TRAF3 K63-linked ubiquitination. NS1/126-225 binding also disrupted the formation of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS)\u2013TRAF3 complex, increasing the recruitment of IKK\u03B5 to MAVS; ultimately shutting down the RIG-I(N)-mediated signal transduction and cellular antiviral responses. This attenuation of cellular antiviral responses leads to evasion of the innate immune response. Taken together, our findings offer an important insight into the interplay between the influenza virus and host innate immunity.","publish_time":"2017-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Wei; Wei, Xiaoqin; Guo, Kelei; Li, Yongtao; Lin, Xian; Zou, Zhong; Zhou, Hongbo; Jin, Meilin","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b6524fc0ce858d2db326b94ff9bf48cc14cd9a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5494602.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28717359/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00779","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS1 C-terminal ED","activation of IFN","NS1 C-terminal effector domain","IFN-\u03B2 transcription","recruitment domain","induction of IFN","\u03B2 pathway","N-terminal RNA-binding domain","TRAF domain","TRAF3 complex","induced IFN-\u03B2 reporter activity","attenuation of cellular antiviral responses","influenza virus subtype of H5N1","activation of interferon regulatory factor","mitochondrial antiviral","interferon response","MAVS","form of RIG","binds","TRAF3 K63-linked ubiquitination","virus non-structural protein","active caspase activation","innate immune response","phosphorylation of IRF3","recruitment of IKK\u03B5","host innate immunity","TNF receptor-associated factor","mediated signal transduction","evasion","interplay","diverse strategies","important insight","formation","study","underlying mechanisms","findings","results","analysis"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Beginning in April 2010, we conducted an observational cohort study at five hospitals in Mexico City, enrolling subjects who met the criteria for ILI. Evaluations were conducted at enrollment and on day 28, with the collection of clinical data and a nasopharyngeal swab (or nasal aspirate in children). Swabs were tested by multiplex PCR for 15 viral pathogens and real-time PCR for influenza. RESULTS: During the first year, 1065 subjects were enrolled in this study, 55% of whom were hospitalized; 24% of all subjects were children. One or more pathogens were detected by PCR in 64% of subjects, most commonly rhinovirus (25% of all isolates) and influenza (24% of isolates). Six percent of subjects died, and of those, 54% had no pathogen identified. Rhinovirus was the most common pathogen among those who died, although it did not have the highest case fatality rate.

The bifidobacterial population in milk has been attributed to the existence of prebiotic oat in feeding systems. Since breast feeding protects the newborns against several infectious diseases, milk from sows fed with oat could improve the health of piglets. ABSTRACT: The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate the impact of feeding oat on the population of bifidobacteria and (ii) evaluate their probiotic potential. In this study, we investigated the effects of supplementing sows\u2019 gestation and lactation feed with 15% oat (prebiotic source) on the levels of probiotic population in milk. We found that dietary inclusion of oat during lactation and gestation resulted in increased levels of bifidobacteria compared to lactobacilli in sow milk. Furthermore bifidobacteria within the sow milk samples were further evaluated for probiotic potential based on aggregating properties, and acid- and bile-tolerance after exposure to hydrochloric acid (pH 2.5) and bile salts (0%, 0.25%, 0.50%, 1.0% and 2.0%). All isolates survived under the condition of low pH and bile 2.0%. Autoaggregation ability ranged from 17.5% to 73%. These isolates also showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7. Together our results suggest that inclusion of oat in feeding systems could have the potential to improve the intestinal health of piglets by increasing the population of bifidobacteria.","publish_time":"2015-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gyawali, Rabin; Minor, Radiah C.; Donovan, Barry; Ibrahim, Salam A.","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4598697.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26479377/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani5030375","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population of bifidobacteria","potential probiotic bifidobacteria","probiotic potential","impact of feeding oat","sow milk samples","levels of probiotic population","existence of prebiotic oat","dietary inclusion of oat","feeding systems","study","increased levels of bifidobacteria","bifidobacterial population","bile-tolerance","bile salts","isolates","intestinal health of piglets","lactation feed","hydrochloric acid","prebiotic source","condition of low pH","effects of supplementing sows\u2019 gestation","exposure","lactobacilli","antimicrobial activity","aggregating properties","coli O157","newborns","infectious diseases","H7","ABSTRACT","objectives","SIMPLE SUMMARY","results","Autoaggregation ability","breast"],"language":"en"},

The number of reports on newly obtained VLPs has grown proportionally with the systems developed for the expression of these particles. The chapter outlines the recent achievements in two important fields of research brought about by the availability of VLPs produced in a foreign host. These are: (1) The requirements for VLP assembly and (2) the use of VLPs as carriers for foreign epitopes. VLP technology is a rapidly advancing domain of molecular and structural biology. Extensive progress in VLP studies was achieved as the insect cell based protein production system was developed. This baculovirus expression system has many advantages for the synthesis of viral structural proteins resulting in the formation of VLPs. It allows production of large amounts of correctly folded proteins while also providing cell membranes that can serve as structural elements for enveloped viruses. These features give us the opportunity to gain insights into the interactions and requirements accompanying VLP formation that are similar to the assembly events occurring in mammalian cells. Other encouraging elements are the ability to easily scale up the system and the simplicity of purification of the assembled VLPs. The growing number of VLPs carrying foreign protein fragments on their surface and studies on the successful assembly of these chimeric molecules is a promising avenue towards the development of a new technology, in which the newly designed VLPs will be directed to particular mammalian cell types by exposing specific binding domains. The progress made in modeling the surface of VLPs makes them to date the best candidates for the design of delivery systems that can efficiently reach their targets.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palucha, Andrzej; Loniewska, Adrianna; Satheshkumar, Subbian; Boguszewska\u2010Chachulska, Anna M.; Umashankar, Mahadevaiah; Milner, Malgorzata; Haenni, Anne\u2010Lise; Savithri, Handanahal Subbarao","journal":"Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/794906ba7f4f57e267f5b6af538f42a7c783d039.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119358.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079660305800042; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079660305800042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["formation of VLPs","surface of VLPs","use of VLPs","assembled VLPs","obtained VLPs","designed VLPs","availability of VLPs","growing number of VLPs","VLP assembly","VLP studies","structural elements of viruses","VLP formation","VLP technology","structural biology","protein production system","insect cell","cell membranes","foreign protein fragments","synthesis of viral structural proteins","successful assembly","assembly events","foreign epitopes","foreign host","requirements","baculovirus expression system","encouraging elements","particles","particular mammalian cell types","folded proteins","mammalian cells","number of reports","enveloped viruses","new technology","Extensive progress","production of large amounts","design of delivery systems","advantages","advancing domain of molecular","chimeric molecules","specific binding domains","interactions","recent achievements","promising avenue","considerable attention","important fields of research","development","best candidates","simplicity of purification","carriers","Publisher Summary Virus","opportunity","decades","insights","chapter","features","targets"],"language":"en"},

The pervasive aspect of these drones is due to their ability to answer people\u2019s needs. Drones are providing users with a bird\u2019s eye that can be activated and used almost anywhere and at any time. However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike. The probability and frequency of these attacks are both high and their impact can be very dangerous with devastating effects. Therefore, the need for detective, protective and preventive counter-measures is highly required. The aim of this survey is to investigate the emerging threats of using drones in cyber-attacks, along the countermeasures to thwart these attacks. The different uses of drones for malicious purposes are also reviewed, along the possible detection methods. As such, this paper analyzes the exploitation of drones vulnerabilities within communication links, as well as smart devices and hardware, including smart-phones and tablets. Moreover, this paper presents a detailed review on the drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage in multiple domains (i.e civilian, military, terrorism, etc.) and for different purposes. A realistic attack scenario is also presented, which details how the authors performed a simulated attack on a given drone following the hacking cycle. This review would greatly help ethical hackers to understand the existing vulnerabilities of UAVs in both military and civilian domains. Moreover, it allows them to adopt and come up with new techniques and technologies for enhanced UAV attack detection and protection. As a result, various civilian and military anti-drones/UAVs (detective and preventive) countermeasures will be reviewed.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yaacoub, Jean-Paul; Salman, Ola","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cdcb926902d1878a7c8a48bfdb2d9c77ec5be02.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542660519302112; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542660519302112?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["military anti-drones","exploitation of drones vulnerabilities","different uses of drones","number of used drones","malicious use of drones","civilian domains","cyber-attacks","enhanced UAV attack detection","detective","e civilian","simulated attack","cyber-criminals","countermeasures","different purposes","malicious purposes","paper","existing vulnerabilities of UAVs","realistic attack scenario","given drone","smart devices","multiple domains","smart-phones","detailed review","preventive counter-measures","possible detection methods","Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","demand","usage","technologies","communication links","new techniques","significant increase","emerging threats","continuous rise","impact","hardware","ethical hackers","result","protection","terrorism","multi-purpose applications","world","survey","hacking cycle","frequency","users","devastating effects","bird\u2019s eye","people\u2019s needs","tablets","probability","authors","pervasive aspect","aim","time"],"language":"en"},

However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease. In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity. METHODS: We identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms. We followed up patients clinically until they tested negative for COVID-19 on at least 2 sequential respiratory tract specimens collected \u226524 hours apart. We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: There were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone. Between the 2 groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course. The diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5.4 \u00B1 3.1 days and a frequency of 4.3 \u00B1 2.2 bowel movements per day. Concurrent fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom. Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 \u00B1 7.7 vs 11.6 \u00B1 5.1 days, P \u003C 0.001). Nevertheless, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance (P \u003C 0.001) and were more likely to be fecal virus positive (73.3% vs 14.3%, P = 0.033) than those with respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: We describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity marked by the presence of digestive symptoms. These patients are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Chaoqun; Duan, Caihan; Zhang, Shengyan; Spiegel, Brennan; Shi, Huiying; Wang, Weijun; Zhang, Lei; Lin, Rong; Liu, Jun; Ding, Zhen; Hou, Xiaohua","journal":"Am J Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04002eb2da9febbca9ac7f6d35c02f5ca32c91f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172493.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000000664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301761/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","presence of digestive symptoms","mild disease severity","low severity COVID","clinical characteristics of COVID","sequential respiratory tract specimens","Coronavirus disease","unique subgroup of COVID","severe disease","days","viral clearance","symptom onset","experienced diarrhea","longer duration","viral RNA","vs","presenting","longer delay","average duration","clinical features","fecal virus positive","shortness of breath","stool","care","delayed diagnosis","cough","nausea","bowel movements","sore throat","frequency","hours","OBJECTIVES","vomiting","DISCUSSION","illness course","outpatients","groups","Concurrent fever","METHODS","RESULTS","study"],"language":"en"},

In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are important reservoirs for Adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their probability of hosting Adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of Adenoviruses and mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of Adenoviruses across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could hinder transmission of Adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of Adenoviruses was reported for the Iberian species Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii and Nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter, males were more likely to be infected by Adenoviruses than females, due to the immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season. As a general trend across species, we found that the number of Adenoviruses positive individuals was different across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with their geographic distances (P. pygmaeus). These results increase our knowledge about the transmission mechanisms of Adenoviruses. Adenoviruses are DNA viruses with a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans, causing ocular, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Here, we focus on the prevalence of Adenoviruses in bats, which are known to be natural reservoir of many viruses, using the results of recent screenings for prevalence of these viruses in 33 European bat species. Our aim is to find association between Adenoviruses prevalence and biological and behavioral host traits, considering the heterogeneity both between and within species in order to have a deeper understanding of mechanisms of viral transmission. Our results highlight the importance of mating strategy: bats species using swarming as mating strategy are less likely to be infected by Adenoviruses. Moreover, we found that locality of capture can explain a higher prevalence of Adenovirus within species. However, no general pattern has been found in the analysis at individual level, suggesting a strong species specificity and complex viral transmission dynamics.","publish_time":"2019-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rossetto, Federica; Iglesias-Caballero, Maria; Liedtke, H.

At the opposite extreme, high-dimensional models that are both individual-based and stochastic incorporate the distributed nature of ecological interactions.

As an alternative closer to the typical temporal models used in ecology, we present here results on \u201Cmodified mean-field equations\u201D for infectious disease dynamics, in which only mean quantities are followed and the effect of heterogeneous mixing is incorporated implicitly. We specifically investigate the previously proposed empirical parameterization of heterogeneous mixing in which the bilinear incidence rate SI is replaced by a nonlinear term kS p I q , for the case of stochastic SIRS dynamics on different contact networks, from a regular lattice to a random structure via small-world configurations. We show that, for two distinct dynamical cases involving a stable equilibrium and a noisy endemic steady state, the modified mean-field model approximates successfully the steady state dynamics as well as the respective short and long transients of decaying cycles. This result demonstrates that early on in the transients an approximate power-law relationship is established between global (mean) quantities and the covariance structure in the network.

During the last decade, it has become clear that integrins significantly participate in various host-pathogen interactions involving pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Many bacteria possess adhesins that can bind either directly or indirectly to integrins. However, there appears to be an emerging role for integrins beyond simply adhesion molecules. Given the conserved nature of integrin structure and function, and the diversity of the pathogens which use integrins, it appears that they may act as pattern recognition receptors important for the innate immune response. Several clinically significant bacterial pathogens target lung epithelial integrins, and this review will focus on exploring various structures and mechanisms involved in these interactions.","publish_time":"2008-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ulanova, Marina; Gravelle, Sean; Barnes, Rebecca","journal":"J Innate Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70e9d78f596990dfaa414cd401e6de04a2c0ff52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190199.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375562/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000141865","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["significant bacterial pathogens target lung epithelial integrins","various host-pathogen interactions","pathogenic bacteria","various structures","adhesion molecules","large family of heterodimeric transmembrane cell adhesion receptors","pattern recognition receptors important","function","innate immune response","fungi","review","conserved nature of integrin structure","diversity","emerging role","viruses","mechanisms","decade","adhesins"],"language":"en"},

Ddx1 null flies are viable but significantly smaller than control and Ddx1 heterozygous flies. Female Ddx1 null flies have reduced fertility with egg chambers undergoing autophagy, whereas males are sterile due to disrupted spermatogenesis. Comparative RNA sequencing of control and Ddx1 null third instars identified several transcripts affected by Ddx1 inactivation. One of these, Sirup mRNA, was previously shown to be overexpressed under starvation conditions and implicated in mitochondrial function. We demonstrate that Sirup is a direct binding target of Ddx1 and that Sirup mRNA is differentially spliced in the presence or absence of Ddx1. Combining Ddx1 null mutation with Sirup dsRNA-mediated knock-down causes epistatic lethality not observed in either single mutant.

Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are more susceptible to get severe forms of VRI due to their altered lung mechanics, leading to several complications, such as increased hospital stay, longer mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. This study aimed to identify the frequency of VRI in children with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery, and to compare the major outcomes according to the presence or absence of a VRI. Methods This was a longitudinal, observational cohort study. Nasopharyngeal secretion samples were collected pre- and postoperatively for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, from May 2013 to May 2014. Respiratory viruses were detected using CLART Pneumovir\u00AE. Results Forty-eight patients were enrolled. We found a VRI preoperatively in 16 children with CHD before surgery (33.3%), and the frequency of new infections was 8.3% (4 patients). However, in this study, in univariate analyses, the two groups did not differ in any of the studied outcomes. In the multivariate regression models, adjusting for age and STAT category, the presence of a VRI did not show a significant effect on the major outcomes.

Methods A total of 16 024 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory infections in 14 hospitals, and screened for RSV and seven other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Six hundred and twenty-three RSV-positive samples from 13 hospitals were further analyzed for subtypes. G gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed based on 46 RSV-A and 15 RSV-B strains. Results RSV was detected in 9.5% of the 16 024 specimens, the highest among the eight respiratory viruses screened. Most of these specimens came from inpatients and children under 3 years of age. The incidence of RSV-A (9.4%) was higher than that of RSV-B (4.4%) in children (\u003C15 years), but not in adults (0.64% vs. 0.58%). A 2-year RSV-A dominance followed by a 1-year RSV-B dominance pattern was found. The co-detection rate of RSV was 25.1%. The main prevalent genotypes were NA1, ON1, and BA9.

Recent findings have led to a basic understanding of cell and organ histopathology caused by the H5N1 virus. Here we review the pathology of H5N1 avian influenza reported in postmortem and clinical studies and discuss the key pathogenetic mechanisms. Specifically, the virus infects isolated pulmonary epithelial cells and causes diffuse alveolar damage and hemorrhage in the lungs of infected patients. In addition, the virus may infect other organs, including the trachea, the intestines, and the brain, and it may penetrate the placental barrier and infect the fetus. Dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines is likely to be one of the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza. We also review the various molecular determinants of increased pathogenicity that have been identified in recent years and the role of avian and human influenza virus receptors in relation to the transmissibility of the H5N1 virus. A comprehensive appreciation of H5N1 influenza pathogenetic mechanisms should aid in the design of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this emerging disease.","publish_time":"2008-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Korteweg, Christine; Gu, Jiang","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/064d56ddc2f6072a1a58e92edcebf7f9e690fa6a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5a1ef7e1f6208caf44f44d1ce58a510a094e25a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2329826.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2353/ajpath.2008.070791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18403604/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2329826?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944010618767; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944010618767","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H5N1 virus","pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza","pathology of H5N1 avian influenza","human influenza virus receptors","comprehensive appreciation of H5N1 influenza pathogenetic mechanisms","key mechanisms","key pathogenetic mechanisms","role of avian","Recent findings","emerging disease","recent years","fatal infectious disease","diffuse alveolar damage","isolated pulmonary epithelial cells","hemorrhage","organ histopathology","clinical studies","relation","diagnosis","prevention","basic understanding of cell","postmortem","transmissibility","design of effective strategies","various molecular determinants of increased pathogenicity","treatment","lungs of infected patients","devastating pandemic","Dysregulation of cytokines","chemokines","form","intestines","placental barrier","fetus","trachea","organs","brain","humans","addition"],"language":"en"},

TCB\u2019s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector \u2013 the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients exhibiting atypical manifestations or awaiting definitive diagnosis. A second adaptation involves enhancing the checkpoint hand disinfection and gowning up with Personal Protective Equipment deployed in traditional TCB. Under eTCB, checkpoint hand disinfection and donning of face masks are now required of all visitors who seek to enter hospitals. These enhancements ensure that transmissions by droplets, fomites and contact are disrupted both within hospitals and between hospitals and the broader community.

DESIGN: We utilized Strauss\u2019 grounded theory to develop an expanded model of social disruption due to biological events based on retrospective and prospective case studies. We then applied this model to the temporal domain and propose a heuristic staging model, the Wilson\u2013Collmann Scale for assessing biological event evolution. MEASUREMENTS: We retrospectively and manually examined hard copy archival local media reports in the native vernacular for three biological events associated with substantial social disruption. The model was then tested prospectively through media harvesting based on keywords corresponding to the model parameters. RESULTS: Our heuristic staging model provides valuable information about the features of a biological event that can be used to determine the level of concern warranted, such as whether the pathogen in question is responding to established public health disease control measures, including the use of antimicrobials or vaccines; whether the public health and medical infrastructure of the country involved is adequate to mount the necessary response; whether the country\u2019s officials are providing an appropriate level of information to international public health authorities; and whether the event poses a international threat. The approach is applicable for monitoring open-source (public-domain) media for indications and warnings of such events, and specifically for markers of the social disruption that commonly occur as these events unfold. These indications and warnings can then be used as the basis for staging the biological threat in the same manner that the United States National Weather Service currently uses storm warning models (such as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) to detect and assess threatening weather conditions. CONCLUSION: Used as a complement to current epidemiological surveillance methods, our approach could aid global public health officials and national political leaders in responding to biological threats of international public health significance.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, James M.; Polyak, Marat G.; Blake, Jane W.; Collmann, Jeff","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d33b572e407ad13e9383d9ca7e05cc80bc2c6858.json; document_parses/pdf_json/26273a8abe98bbeabfe8651fc433188c5f5b82c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2274782.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S106750270700357X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S106750270700357X; https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-pdf/15/2/158/2086447/15-2-158.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States National Weather Service"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biological events","public-domain","biological threats of international public health significance","international public health authorities","international public health community","global public health officials","heuristic staging model","model parameters","biological event evolution","expanded model of social disruption","assessment of biological threats","public health disease control measures","international threat","substantial social disruption","approach","media harvesting","indications","warnings","appropriate level of information","country\u2019s officials","Collmann Scale","valuable information","temporal domain","level of concern","United States National Weather Service","national political leaders","hard copy archival local media reports","threatening weather conditions","Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale","native vernacular","swift intervention","manner","Wilson","storm warning models","current epidemiological surveillance methods","complement","retrospective","open-source","rapid detection","features","use of antimicrobials","grounded theory","medical infrastructure","necessary response","prospective case studies","keywords","vaccines","Strauss","question","RESULTS","markers","DESIGN","OBJECTIVE","paper","basis","pathogen","CONCLUSION","MEASUREMENTS"],"language":"en"},

Section Editor: Anne Moscona \u2013 Department of Pediatrics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L. Levy Place, Box 1198, New York, NY 10029, USA When the SARS coronavirus came dramatically to attention as a fatal and potentially pandemic respiratory disease, the scientific response was swift and effective. The etiological agent was identified, the genome was cloned and sequenced, and large strides have been made in understanding key points in the viral life cycle, including recent identification of a functional host cell receptor and solution of the three-dimensional structure of the viral attachment protein. Much of this progress was possible only because a foundation of basic coronavirus biology existed. The Denison laboratory has been at the forefront of the small group of investigators who have dissected the basic features of coronaviruses.

Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for \u003E 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered. Methods: Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as \u201Ccough,\u201D \u201Cacute bronchitis,\u201D and \u201Cacute viral respiratory infection.\u201D Results: Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period. Conclusion: Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.","publish_time":"2006-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braman, Sidney S.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca36180197f0a2bda83c8c743b1cad8d4c90924e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428698/; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.129.1_suppl.95s; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215528377; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215528377","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Library of Medicine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of acute bronchitis","acute asthma","cause of acute cough","common cause of acute bronchitis","acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis","acute respiratory infection","putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis","cause of bronchitis","acute viral respiratory infection","treatment of cough","cause of cough","routine treatment","start of treatment","early treatment","weeks","probable whooping cough","common diagnoses","Respiratory viruses","clinical practice","bacterial infection","self-limited respiratory disorder","adult patients","exacerbation of COPD","search terms","search dating","review","recommendations","widespread use of antibiotics","viral cultures","expectorant therapy","coughing paroxysms","sputum production","phlegm production","radiographic evidence of pneumonia","short-term symptomatic relief of coughing","primary care clinicians","emergency department physicians","normal chest radiograph","National Library of Medicine","PubMed","human studies","role","English language","previous controlled trials","serologic assays","disease","inhaled bronchodilator","data","organism responsible","macrolide antibiotic","literature","Children","times","Conclusion","vigorous efforts","Results","Background","purpose","Antitussive agents","Methods","days","Fewer","syndrome","period"],"language":"en"},

POLD1 associates with three smaller subunits (POLD2, POLD3, POLD4), which together with Replication Factor C and Proliferating Nuclear Cell Antigen constitute the polymerase holoenzyme. Pol\u03B4 function is essential for replication, with a primary role as the replicase for the lagging strand. Pol\u03B4 also has an important proofreading ability conferred by the exonuclease activity, which is critical for ensuring replicative fidelity, but also serves to repair DNA lesions arising as a result of exposure to mutagens. Pol\u03B4 has been shown to be important for multiple forms of DNA repair, including nucleotide excision repair, double strand break repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. A growing number of studies in the past decade have linked germline and sporadic mutations in POLD1 and the other subunits of Pol\u03B4 with human pathologies. Mutations in Pol\u03B4 in mice and humans lead to genomic instability, mutator phenotype and tumorigenesis. The advent of genome sequencing techniques has identified damaging mutations in the proofreading domain of POLD1 as the underlying cause of some inherited cancers, and suggested that mutations in POLD1 may influence therapeutic management. In addition, mutations in POLD1 have been identified in the developmental disorders of mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features and lipodystrophy and atypical Werner syndrome, while changes in expression or activity of POLD1 have been linked to senescence and aging. Intriguingly, some recent evidence suggests POLD1 function may also be altered in diabetes. We provide an overview of critical Pol\u03B4 activities in the context of these pathologic conditions.","publish_time":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicolas, Emmanuelle; Golemis, Erica A.; Arora, Sanjeevani","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cccc6dacebba3adc59d703f2f2f3a20dfc452e97.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0a1c4a187e7e929cdf16ce37e7e475045a9ffab2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4969162.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27320729/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4969162?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111916304942; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111916304942; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Werner"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activity of POLD1","POLD1 function","POLD1 associates","subunits of Pol\u03B4","Pol\u03B4 function","proofreading domain of POLD1","mismatch repair","DNA polymerase","repair DNA lesions","nucleotide excision repair","base excision repair","damaging mutations","sporadic mutations","overview of critical Pol\u03B4 activities","multiple forms of DNA repair","double strand break repair","polymerase holoenzyme","human polymerase delta","essential catalytic activities of polymerase \u03B4","exonuclease activity","important proofreading ability","smaller subunits","lagging strand","human pathologies","exonuclease moieties","Replication Factor C","progeroid features","deafness","genomic instability","humans lead","Nuclear Cell Antigen","atypical Werner syndrome","lipodystrophy","past decade","changes","mice","large p125 subunit","mutator phenotype","underlying cause","developmental disorders of mandibular hypoplasia","POLD2","expression","context","germline","advent of genome sequencing techniques","tumorigenesis","replicase","POLD3","primary role","result of exposure","POLD4","inherited cancers","growing number of studies","recent evidence","therapeutic management","pathologic conditions","replicative fidelity","mutagens","senescence","addition","diabetes"],"language":"en"},

We identified 26 major emerging and reemerging infectious diseases of bacterial origin; most of them originated either from an animal and are considered to be zoonoses or from water sources. Major contributing factors in the emergence of these bacterial infections are: (1) development of new diagnostic tools, such as improvements in culture methods, development of molecular techniques and implementation of mass spectrometry in microbiology; (2) increase in human exposure to bacterial pathogens as a result of sociodemographic and environmental changes; and (3) emergence of more virulent bacterial strains and opportunistic infections, especially affecting immunocompromised populations. A precise definition of their implications in human disease is challenging and requires the comprehensive integration of microbiological, clinical and epidemiologic aspects as well as the use of experimental models.

This suspicion can also lead to medical confusion and inappropriate management of acute respiratory syndrome due to causes other than MERS-CoV. METHODS: We studied the characteristics and outcome of patients hospitalized for suspected MERS-CoV infection in the isolation wards of two referral infectious disease departments in the Paris area between January 2013 and December 2016. RESULTS: Of 93 adult patients (49 male (52.6%), median age 63.4 years) hospitalized, 82 out of 93 adult patients had returned from Saudi Arabia, and 74 of them were pilgrims (Hajj). Chest X-ray findings were abnormal in 72 (77%) patients. The 93 patients were negative for MERS-CoV RT-PCR, and 70 (75.2%) patients had documented infection, 47 (50.5%) viral, 22 (23.6%) bacterial and one Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Microbiological analysis identified Rhinovirus (27.9%), Influenza virus (26.8%), Legionella pneumophila (7.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.5%), and non-MERS-coronavirus (6.4%). Antibiotics were initiated in 81 (87%) cases, with two antibiotics in 63 patients (67.7%). The median duration of hospitalization and isolation was 3 days (1\u201333) and 24 h (8\u201392), respectively. Time of isolation decreased over time (P \u003C 0.01). Two patients (2%) died. CONCLUSION: The management of patients with possible MERS-CoV infection requires medical facilities with trained personnel, and rapid access to virological results. Empirical treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and an association of antibiotics effective against S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila are the cornerstones of the management of patients hospitalized for suspected MERS-CoV infection.

More than 1500 cases of MERS have been reported in human beings to date. Although MERS has been associated with 30% case fatality in human beings, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in dromedaries is usually asymptomatic. In rare cases, dromedaries may develop mild respiratory signs. No MERS-CoV or antibodies against the virus have been detected in camelids other than dromedaries. MERS-CoV is mainly acquired in dromedaries when they are less than 1 year of age, and the proportion of seropositivity increases with age to a seroprevalence of 100% in adult dromedaries. Laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries can be achieved through virus isolation using Vero cells, RNA detection by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and antigen detection using respiratory specimens or serum. Rapid nucleocapsid antigen detection using a lateral flow platform allows efficient screening of dromedaries carrying MERS-CoV. In addition to MERS-CoV, which is a lineage C virus in the Betacoronavirus (betaCoV) genus, a lineage B betaCoV and a virus in the Alphacoronavirus (alphaCoV) genus have been detected in dromedaries. Dromedary CoV UAE-HKU23 is closely related to human CoV OC43, whereas the alphaCoV has not been detected in human beings to date.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wernery, Ulrich; Lau, Susanna K.P.; Woo, Patrick C.Y.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21869406b742378a0576765507f120b55cf92531.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110516.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023317300059; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2016.12.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28190501/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023317300059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","cases of MERS","MERS coronavirus","CoV infection","adult dromedaries","human CoV OC43","human beings","Laboratory diagnosis of MERS","efficient screening of dromedaries","Dromedary CoV UAE-HKU23","virus isolation","lineage C virus","RNA detection","respiratory specimens","genus","alphaCoV","date","Rapid nucleocapsid antigen detection","lineage B betaCoV","mild respiratory signs","year of age","rare cases","Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR","lateral flow platform","Vero cells","Betacoronavirus","case fatality","proportion of seropositivity","seroprevalence","serum","Alphacoronavirus","zoonotic viral disease","antibodies","camelids","addition"],"language":"en"},

This special dimerization elucidates the structural basis for the observation that there is no exchange between monomeric and dimeric forms of M(pro)-C and M(pro)-\u03947.","publish_time":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Nan; Zhang, Shengnan; Xue, Fei; Kang, Xue; Zou, Peng; Chen, Jiaxuan; Liang, Chao; Rao, Zihe; Jin, Changwen; Lou, Zhiyong; Xia, Bin","journal":"Protein Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c8e478a1cae415e3aeaf8738b3bed3309856e23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2762595.xml.json","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pro.76; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19319935/; https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.76","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C monomer","C dimer structure","C-terminal domain","C domain-swapped dimer","stable dimer","stable monomer","D domain","crystal structure","\u03947","helices","anti-SARS drug development","SARS coronavirus main protease","extensive proteolytic processing","viral polyproteins","important target","essential role","Zhong","N-finger deletion mutant","structural basis","exchange","dimeric forms","J Virol","special dimerization","observation","pp1ab","general fold","folding subunit","protomers","structures"],"language":"en"},

Following on from electron microscopy, cell culture and PCR, next-generation sequencing is one of these methodologies that is now changing the way that we understand viruses, particularly in the areas of genome sequencing, evolution, ecology, discovery and transcriptomics. Possibilities for these methodologies are only limited by our scientific imagination and, to some extent, by their cost, which has restricted their use to relatively small numbers of samples. Challenges remain, including the storage and analysis of the large amounts of data generated. As the chemistries employed mature, costs will decrease. In addition, improved methods for analysis will become available, opening yet further applications in virology including routine diagnostic work on individuals, and new understanding of the interaction between viral and host transcriptomes. An exciting era of viral exploration has begun, and will set us new challenges to understand the role of newly discovered viral diversity in both disease and health.","publish_time":"2012-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radford, Alan D.; Chapman, David; Dixon, Linda; Chantrey, Julian; Darby, Alistair C.; Hall, Neil","journal":"J Gen Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a2b2c72af5a57c21d912a3f1e543bcd75345883.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3709572.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.043182-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22647373/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new challenges","new ways","new understanding","analysis","methodologies","discovered viral diversity","scientific questions","generation sequencing","exciting era of viral exploration","scientific imagination","areas of genome sequencing","PCR","routine diagnostic work","individuals","scales","applications","virology","ecology","interaction","role","cell culture","advent of revolutionary technologies","electron microscopy","improved methods","discovery","disease","storage","large amounts of data","advance knowledge","small numbers of samples","transcriptomics","extent","addition","host transcriptomes","health","chemistries","costs","viruses","progress of science","Possibilities"],"language":"en"},

To date, there are no effective vaccines or antiviral treatments available that are capable of limiting the pathogenesis of any human coronaviral infection. An attractive target for the development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics is the 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), which is essential for the progression of the coronaviral life cycle. Herein, we report the screening results of a small, 230-member peptidomimetic library against HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) and the identification of 43 peptidomimetic compounds showing good to excellent inhibitory potency of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) with IC(50) values ranging from low micromolar to sub-micromolar. We established structure-activity relationships (SARs) describing the important ligand-based features required for potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition and identified a seemingly favored peptidic backbone for HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition. To investigate this, a molecular sub-structural analysis of the most potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibitor was accomplished by the synthesis and testing of the lead peptidomimetic inhibitor\u0027s sub-structural components, confirming the activity of the favored backbone (22A) identified via SAR analysis. In order to elucidate the structural reasons for such potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition by the peptidomimetics having the 22A backbone, we determined the X-ray structures of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) in complex with three peptidomimetic inhibitors. Sequence alignment of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro), and two other lineage C Betacoronaviruses 3CL(pro)\u0027s, HKU5-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL(pro), show that the active site residues of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) that participate in inhibitor binding are conserved in HKU5-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL(pro). Furthermore, we assayed our most potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibitor for inhibition of HKU5-CoV 3CL(pro) and found it to have sub-micromolar inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 0.54 \u00B1 0.03 \u03BCM). The X-ray structures and SAR analysis reveal critical insights into the structure and inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro), providing fundamental knowledge that may be exploited in the development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics for coronaviruses emerging from zoonotic reservoirs.","publish_time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"St. John, Sarah E.; Tomar, Sakshi; Stauffer, Shaun R.; Mesecar, Andrew D.","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5433438.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2015.06.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26190463/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089615005337; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089615005337","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAR"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["potent HKU4-CoV","MERS-CoV","HKU5-CoV","inhibition of HKU4","X-ray structures of HKU4","bat coronavirus HKU4","Sequence alignment of HKU4","excellent inhibitory potency of HKU4","inhibition of HKU5","active site residues of HKU4","sub-micromolar inhibitory activity","molecular sub-structural analysis","peptidomimetic compounds","development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics","peptidomimetic inhibitors","SAR analysis","c lineage","favored backbone","lead peptidomimetic inhibitor\u0027s sub-structural components","human coronaviral infection","member peptidomimetic library","structural reasons","structure-activity relationships","coronaviral life cycle","low micromolar","inhibitor binding","favored peptidic backbone","lineage C Betacoronaviruses","zoonotic shift","human population","zoonotic reservoirs","high sequence similarity","deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","critical insights","important ligand-based features","effective vaccines","antiviral treatments available","SARs","testing","progression","threat","pathogenesis","synthesis","values","identification","attractive target","spill","complex","peptidomimetics","screening results","event","date","order","fundamental knowledge","protease","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

The national system had been able to detect and confirm the outbreak etiology but required external support to monitor the spread of cholera and coordinate response, because much of the information produced was insufficiently timely for real-time monitoring and directing of a rapid, targeted response. The A\u0026R System was designed by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization in collaboration with the Haiti Ministry of Health, and it was based on a network of partners, including any institution, structure, or individual that could identify, verify, and respond to alerts. The defined objectives were to (1) save lives through early detection and treatment of cases and (2) control the spread through early intervention at the community level. The operational structure could be broken down into three principle categories: (1) alert (early warning), (2) verification and assessment of the information, and (3) efficient and timely response in coordination with partners to avoid duplication. Information generated by the A\u0026R System was analyzed and interpreted, and the qualitative information was critical in qualifying the epidemic and defining vulnerable areas, particularly because the national surveillance system reported incomplete data for more than one department. The A\u0026R System detected a number of alerts unrelated to cholera and facilitated rapid access to that information. The sensitivity of the system and its ability to react quickly was shown in May of 2011, when an abnormal increase in alerts coming from several communes in the Sud-Est Department in epidemiological weeks (EWs) 17 and 18 were noted and disseminated network-wide and response activities were implemented. The national cholera surveillance system did not register the increase until EWs 21 and 22, and the information did not become available until EWs 23 and 24, when the peak of cases had already been reached. Although many of the partners reporting alerts during the peak of the cholera epidemic have since left Haiti, the A\u0026R System has continued to function as an Early Warning (EWARN) System, and it continues to be developed with recent activities, such as the distribution of cell phones to enhance alert communication.","publish_time":"2013-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santa-Olalla, Patricia; Gayer, Michelle; Magloire, Roc; Barrais, Robert; Valenciano, Marta; Aramburu, Carmen; Poncelet, Jean Luc; Gustavo Alonso, Juan Carlos; Van Alphen, Dana; Heuschen, Florence; Andraghetti, Roberta; Lee, Robert; Drury, Patrick; Aldighieri, Sylvain","journal":"Am J Trop Med Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/109ac576c495ec3c3f4366c6f0f31d69e9b60dee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3795099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24106196/; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.13-0267","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["A\u0026R System","Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization","Sud-Est Department"],"locations":["Haiti"],"keyphrases":["R System","national system","national cholera surveillance system","existing national surveillance system","cholera epidemic","spread of cholera","timely response","response activities","qualitative information","early warning","targeted response","EWs","early detection","early intervention","network of partners","Haiti Ministry of Health","World Health Organization","alert communication","number of alerts unrelated","peak of cases","Pan American Health Organization","rapid access","treatment of cases","network-wide","abnormal increase","recent activities","operational structure","Sud-Est Department","collaboration","epidemiological weeks","communes","coordination","incomplete data","external support","distribution of cell phones","institution","necessity","outbreak etiology","community level","real-time monitoring","vulnerable areas","lives","verification","implementation","start","EWARN","individual","principle categories","duplication","assessment","sensitivity","ability","defined objectives"],"language":"en"},

In immature dendritic cells half of the FVIII-loaded MHC class II molecules are retained within the cell, whereas in LPS-matured dendritic cells the majority of MHC class II/peptide complexes is present on the plasma membrane. Time-course studies revealed that presentation of FVIII-derived peptides was optimal between 12 and 24 hours after maturation but persisted for at least 96 hours. We also show that macrophages are able to internalize FVIII as efficiently as dendritic cells, however FVIII was presented on MHC class II with a lower efficiency and with different epitopes compared to dendritic cells. In total, 48 FVIII core-peptides were identified using a DCs derived of 8 different donors. Five HLA-promiscuous FVIII peptide regions were found \u2013 these were presented by at least 4 out of 8 donors. The remaining 42 peptide core regions in FVIII were presented by DCs derived from a single (30 peptides) or two to three donors (12 peptides). Overall, our findings show that a broad repertoire of FVIII peptides can be presented on HLA-DR.","publish_time":"2013-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Haren, Simon D.; Wroblewska, Aleksandra; Herczenik, Eszter; Kaijen, Paul H.; Ruminska, Aleksandra; ten Brinke, Anja; Meijer, Alexander B.; Voorberg, Jan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f5a550869a4ff5f8c754a9aa89453486cab2985.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3828219.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24244658/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0080239","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presentation of FVIII","FVIII core-peptides","Activation of FVIII","FVIII domains","derived peptides","broad repertoire of FVIII peptides","FVIII-loaded MHC class","T cells","induction of anti-FVIII antibodies","HLA-promiscuous FVIII peptide regions","immature dendritic cells half","human monocyte-derived dendritic cells","LPS-matured dendritic cells","majority of MHC class","different donors","peptide core regions","peptide complexes","DCs","hours","T cell-dependent process","specific CD4","different epitopes","formation of inhibitory antibodies","lower efficiency","molecules","coagulation factor","treatment of hemophilia","severe complication","antigen","Time-course studies","plasma membrane","total","patients","findings","maturation","macrophages","study"],"language":"en"},

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures. METHODS: From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk. FINDINGS: Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20\u201322). Cases were isolated on average 4\u00B76 days (95% CI 4\u00B71\u20135\u00B70) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1\u00B79 days (95% CI 1\u00B71\u20132\u00B77). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6\u00B727 [95% CI 1\u00B749\u201326\u00B733] for household contacts and 7\u00B706 [1\u00B743\u201334\u00B791] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11\u00B72% (95% CI 9\u00B71\u201313\u00B78), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7\u00B74% in children \u003C10 years vs population average of 6\u00B76%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0\u00B74 (95% CI 0\u00B73\u20130\u00B75), with a mean serial interval of 6\u00B73 days (95% CI 5\u00B72\u20137\u00B76). INTERPRETATION: Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

Abstract Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mpn) infections in Basse-Normandie by a retrospective analysis of serological and PCR data, and to confirm the diagnostic utility of PCR and serology. Methods From 1997 to August 2005, 6156 serum samples and 6123 respiratory tract samples were collected from hospitalised patients and evaluated for the diagnosis of Mpn infection by PCR, serological assays, or by the two tests. During the epidemic period (2004-2005), the results of 1489 patients were analysed. Results Over the 9-y period, the seroprevalence was 40,4% and we reported on 525 cases with serologically or/and PCR proven Mpn infection, according a cyclic pattern spaced out 7 years. During the epidemic period, the seroprevalence increased to 50,2% and the rate of infections was 8.3%. The analysis of the 124 cases of Mpn infection showed typical epidemiological characteristics: a peak of incidence among the children and young adults, a summer-winter pattern and some coinfections with viral strains. For diagnosis of Mpn infection, the comparison of PCR and serological assays among 36 patients showed a concordance of only 41.7%. Conclusion Mpn infections were endemic and outbreaks were observed according cyclic pattern with a high incidence specially in the children. Sensitive and specific tests were now available for early and reliable diagnosis. In children, the combination of the PCR on nasopharyngeal samples and the IgM EIA serology test were recommended. In adults, the PCR was privilegiated.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petitjean-Lecherbonnier, J.; Vabret, A.; Gouarin, S.; Dina, J.; Legrand, L.; Freymuth, F.","journal":"Pathologie Biologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f63a45b676e411045d01e17a8599fc39be1e437.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119118.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0369811406001684; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811406001684","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sur les"],"organizations":["PCR","IgM EIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR et s\u00E9rologie","et une PCR sur","r\u00E9sultats s\u00E9rologiques et PCR","soit par PCR","comparison of PCR","PCR data","PCR proven Mpn infection","Patients et m\u00E9thodes","s\u00E9rums et","et l\u0027incidence","diagnostic utility of PCR","Conclusion Mpn infections","diagnosis of Mpn infection","patients hospitalis\u00E9s et analys\u00E9s","cas d\u0027infection ont \u00E9t\u00E9 diagnostiqu\u00E9s par PCR et","cases of Mpn infection","une recherche d\u0027infection \u00E0 Mpn","r\u00E9sultats chez","infections \u00E0 Mpn surviennent sur","une pr\u00E9dominance chez l\u0027enfant et l\u0027adulte jeune","diagnostic pr\u00E9coce et fiable","en Basse-Normandie par une","hospitalised patients","ces infections","patients ont \u00E9t\u00E9 analys\u00E9s","infections \u00E0 Mycoplasma pneumoniae","R\u00E9sultats Sur","rate of infections","particuli\u00E8rement chez l\u0027enfant","soit par s\u00E9rologie Elisa","il convient d\u0027associer une s\u00E9rologie","\u00E0 ao\u00FBt","patients ayant b\u00E9n\u00E9fici\u00E9","children","avec une incidence \u00E9lev\u00E9e lors","montre une concordance dans seulement","une fr\u00E9quence saisonni\u00E8re estivohivernale","deux tests diagnostiques","ou s\u00E9rologie","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements respiratoires ont \u00E9t\u00E9 r\u00E9alis\u00E9s chez","cyclic pattern","p\u00E9riode \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","serological assays","epidemic period","chez l\u0027adulte il faudra privil\u00E9gier","cas diagnostiqu\u00E9s montre","co-infection virale","deux pics \u00E9pid\u00E9miques espac\u00E9s","s\u00E9ropr\u00E9valence moyenne se chiffre \u00E0","valider ces deux outils","peak of incidence","nasopharyngeal samples","serum samples","high incidence","retrospective analysis of serological","specific tests","Pendant","reliable diagnosis","L\u0027analyse","y period","seroprevalence","results","mode end\u00E9mo-\u00E9pid\u00E9mique","epidemiology of Mycoplasma pneumoniae","respiratory tract samples","summer-winter pattern","s\u00E9ropr\u00E9valence augmente","IgM EIA serology test","young adults","se profilant nettement sous","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vement nasopharyng\u00E9","r\u00E9aliser","Nous disposons actuellement d\u0027outils bact\u00E9riologiques performants permettant","r\u00E9trospective","d\u00E9crire l\u0027\u00E9pid\u00E9miologie","l\u0027existence","neuf ann\u00E9es","typical epidemiological characteristics","cette \u00E9tude","outbreaks","coinfections","caract\u00E9ristiques \u00E9pid\u00E9miologiques","l\u0027\u00E9tude L\u0027objectif","study","combination","viral strains","Abstract Objectives","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","years","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiological triangle chain models can be used to present both these types of epidemic. By merging these two triangles we suggest a new four-sided pyramidal model of bioterrorism attack and appropriate levels of prevention. Primordial prevention of biological attacks should comprise the impeding of access of both terrorists and biological agents to the territory. The primary prevention level should comprise internal surveillance of potential sources of agents and terrorists. Secondary prevention activities should be directed toward breaking both the epidemic of infectious disease and that of fear and panic.

These T reg cells are detected at the same time as effector T cells (T eff cells) exhibiting the same specificity and can suppress T eff cell proliferation after stimulation with cognate peptide. These virus-specific T reg cells may be especially effective in inhibiting the immune response during the peak of infection, when virus antigen is maximal. Furthermore, these T reg cells express both IL-10 and IFN-\u03B3 after peptide stimulation. IFN-\u03B3 expression is maintained during both acute and chronic phases of infection.

Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. Benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turn-around time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Zhen; Cui, Haodong; Song, Wenxing; Ru, Xiaoling; Zhou, Wenhua; Yu, Xuefeng","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7207df5b61e93fa5a2b6e720c91aed05270e81be.json; document_parses/pdf_json/066b6e4f1f890a158de1fffaa5228eacd274dc2c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.961268","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["viral RNA extraction method","molecular diagnosis techniques","accurate diagnosis","current molecular diagnosis of COVID","pcMNPs-RNA complexes","early clinical diagnosis","new extraction method","simple manual method","development of pcMNPs","SARS-CoV","sensitive detection of COVID","strong infectivity","copies of SARS","subsequent RT-PCR reactions","strong linear correlation","operational requirements","N gene","amino ester","causing virus","carboxyl groups","novel coronavirus disease","ORFlab","excellent performances","turn","automated high-throughput approach","synthesis of poly","ongoing outbreak","different regions","long incubation period","time-consuming operations","labour intensive","lysis","binding steps","sensitivity","multiple samples","magnetic nanoparticles","simplified process","simplicity","pseudovirus particles","Wuhan","China","issue"],"language":"en"},

Few studies have documented the presence of RSV in the systemic circulation, however there is no consistent information whether virus detection in the blood correlates with disease severity. METHODS: Balb/c mice were inoculated with live RSV, heat-inactivated RSV or medium. A subset of RSV-infected mice was treated with anti-RSV antibody 72 h post-inoculation. RSV RNA loads were measured by PCR in peripheral blood from day 1-21 post-inoculation and were correlated with upper and lower respiratory tract viral loads, the systemic cytokine response, lung inflammation and pulmonary function. Immunohistochemical staining was used to define the localization of RSV antigens in the respiratory tract and peripheral blood. RESULTS: RSV RNA loads were detected in peripheral blood from day 1 to 14 post-inoculation, peaked on day 5 and significantly correlated with nasal and lung RSV loads, airway obstruction, and blood CCL2 and CXCL1 expression. Treatment with anti-RSV antibody reduced blood RSV RNA loads and improved airway obstruction. Immunostaining identified RSV antigens in alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: RSV RNA was detected in peripheral blood upon infection with live RSV, followed a time-course parallel to viral loads assessed in the respiratory tract and was significantly correlated with RSV-induced airway disease.","publish_time":"2010-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torres, Juan Pablo; Gomez, Ana M; Khokhar, Shama; Bhoj, Vijay G; Tagliabue, Claudia; Chang, Michael L; Kiener, Peter A; Revell, Paula A; Ramilo, Octavio; Mejias, Asuncion","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fb2d27c92ebc1fc7804e55e557fe8c126da62f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2946301.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-11-125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20843364/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blood RSV RNA","live RSV","RSV RNA loads","presence of RSV","subset of RSV","lung RSV loads","anti-RSV antibody","localization of RSV antigens","heat-inactivated RSV","RSV-induced airway disease","peripheral blood monocytes","blood correlates","blood CCL2","lower respiratory tract viral loads","day","respiratory epithelium","Respiratory Syncytial Virus","h post-inoculation","improved airway obstruction","infection","lung inflammation","virus detection","c mice","infected mice","systemic circulation","disease severity","systemic cytokine response","alveolar macrophages","PCR","time-course parallel","pulmonary function","consistent information","Immunostaining","BACKGROUND","Treatment","CXCL1 expression","METHODS","Balb","RESULTS","studies","CONCLUSIONS","Immunohistochemical staining"],"language":"en"},

However, the spectrum of pathogenic viruses and atypical bacteria that exist in many of these countries remains incompletely characterized. The aim of this study was to examine the spectrum of pathogenic viruses and atypical bacteria associated with acute respiratory infection in children under the age of 16. METHODS: A total of 10 435 serum sera specimens were collected from hospitalized children presenting with acute respiratory infection symptoms. Indirect immunofluorescence assays were performed to detect immunoglobulin M antibodies against nine common pathogens: mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza virus A, legionella pneumophila, coxiella burnetii and chamydophila pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 10 435 specimens examined, 7046 tested positive for at least one pathogen. Among all of the tested pathogens, mycoplasma pneumonia had the highest detection rate (56.9%). Influenza virus A and influenza virus B epidemics occurred during both winter and summer. The detection rate of respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus was higher in spring. Cases of mixed infection were more complex: 4136 specimens (39.6%) tested positive for \u22652 pathogens. There were statistically significant difference in detection rates of mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza virus A, legionella pneumophila and chamydophila pneumonia among different age groups (P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The most common pathogens causing acute respiratory infection among children in Hubei of China were mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B and respiratory syncytial virus.

Pregnant women infected with influenza A virus were at increased risk of hospitalization and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is associated with high mortality, while their newborns had an increased risk of pre-term birth or low birth weight. Pregnant women have a unique immunological profile modulated by the sex hormones required to maintain pregnancy, namely progesterone and estrogens. The role of these hormones in coordinating maternal immunotolerance in uterine tissue and cellular subsets has been well researched; however, these hormones have wide-ranging effects outside the uterus in modulating the immune response to disease. In this review, we compile research findings in the clinic and in animal models that elaborate on the unique features of H1N1 influenza A viral pathogenesis during pregnancy, the crosstalk between innate immune signaling and hormonal regulation during pregnancy, and the role of pregnancy hormones in modulating cellular responses to influenza A viral infection at mid-gestation. We highlight the ways in which lung architecture and function is stressed by pregnancy, increasing baseline inflammation prior to infection. We demonstrate that infection disrupts progesterone production and upregulates inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandins, resulting in pre-term labor and spontaneous abortions. Lastly, we profile the ways in which pregnancy alters innate and adaptive cellular immune responses to H1N1 influenza viral infection, and the ways in which these protect fetal development at the expense of effective long-term immune memory. Thus, we highlight advancements in the field of reproductive immunology in response to viral infection and illustrate how that knowledge might be used to develop more effective post-infection therapies and vaccination strategies.","publish_time":"2018-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Littauer, Elizabeth Q.; Skountzou, Ioanna","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c6622a7955d513c961a57d13a287300a8ec5c87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6215819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30420854/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02455","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1 influenza viral infection","role of pregnancy hormones","viral pathogenesis","innate immune","ways","unique features of H1N1 influenza","effective post-infection therapies","adaptive cellular immune responses","sex hormones","modulating cellular responses","vulnerability of pregnant women","cellular subsets","increased risk of pre-term birth","expense of effective long-term immune memory","increased risk of hospitalization","pre-term labor","unique immunological profile","H1N1 swine flu pandemic","progesterone production","low birth weight","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","maternal immunotolerance","virus","crosstalk","uterine tissue","field of reproductive immunology","ARDS","newborns","vaccination strategies","uterus","hormonal regulation","inflammatory mediators","fetal development","clinic","animal models","prostaglandins","spontaneous abortions","function","mid-gestation","research findings","lung architecture","cyclooxygenase","advancements","wide-ranging effects","baseline inflammation","review","COX","high mortality","disease","estrogens","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Luciferase assay showed that N protein of SARS-CoV could activate the transcription of hfgl2 promoter compared with the pcDNA3.1 empty vector.

Calves on C MR treatments received 454g of MR from d 2 to 41. Calves on A MR received 916g of MR from d 2 to 8 and 1134g of MR from d 9 to 41. Visitation with calves occurred at 1030 and 1430h daily from d 1 to 56 and comprised verbal stimulation and stirring of starter grain. An opaque curtain divided the calf nursery, with calves in the front half assigned to visitation treatments and those in the rear half not assigned to visitation treatments. Calves were fed their MR treatment until d 43 (preweaning), after which all calves received half of their allotment of MR until d 49 (weaning). Calves were tracked for the next week until d 56 (postweaning). Starter grain and MR intakes were measured daily along with weekly body weight and skeletal measurements. One half of the calves on each treatment had blood samples taken via jugular venipuncture on d 41 (preweaning), 43, 45, 47, 49, and 51 (postweaning) to evaluate blood glucose, urea, nonesterified fatty acids, and cortisol concentrations. During the preweaning and weaning phases, calves on A0 and A1 treatments consumed more MR, less starter, and weighed more than the C0 and C1 calves. Calves on A0 and A1 had greater average daily gain (ADG), hip and withers gain, were taller at the hip, and had larger girths during the preweaning phase. Overall, body weight, withers and hip heights, and heart girths were greater in A0 andA1 calves during the weaning week. Efficiency of utilization of estimated metabolizable energy (ME) intake (ADG/ME) were similar. Glucose and nonesterified fatty acids concentrations were greater in visited calves preweaning. An interaction for glucose was observed during weaning, with A1 calves having the highest concentration and A0 calves having the lowest concentrations during weaning. Cortisol tended to be higher in visited calves during weaning. Postweaning, calves formerly fed A0 and A1 treatments had lower blood glucose and tended to have higher urea and cortisol concentrations than C0 and C1 treatments. The higher plane of nutrition fed calves tended to have higher cortisol concentrations indicating that they experienced more stress due to the removal of MR more than calves fed conventionally. Calves fed the higher plane of MR nutrition consumed more dry matter, ME, and water weighed more, had a greater ADG, and were taller than calves fed the conventional MR. These calves were more efficient (ADG/dry matter intake) when expressed on a dry matter basis, but had similar efficiency when expressed on an ME basis (ADG/ME). Visiting calves did little to reduce the stress of weaning when calves are fed the higher plane of nutrition MR feeding regimen.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guindon, N.

In this study, a SYBR green-based real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique was established for rapid detection and monitoring of this emerging virus. Specific primers were designed based on the conserved region within the M gene of the viral genome. The lowest detection limit of the RT-qPCR assay was 10 copies/\u03BCL. This assay was specific and had no cross-reaction with other 11 swine viruses. The positive rate of 84 clinical samples for the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR and the conventional RT-PCR was 73.81% (62/84) and 53.57% (45/84), respectively.

The antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are currently being tested in several clinical studies as potential candidates to limit SARS-CoV-2-mediated morbidity and mortality. CQ and HCQ (CQ/HCQ) inhibit pH-dependent steps of SARS-CoV-2 replication by increasing pH in intracellular vesicles and interfere with virus particle delivery into host cells. Besides direct antiviral effects, CQ/HCQ specifically target extracellular zinc to intracellular lysosomes where it interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and coronavirus replication. As zinc deficiency frequently occurs in elderly patients and in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes, we hypothesize that CQ/HCQ plus zinc supplementation may be more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than CQ or HCQ in monotherapy. Therefore, CQ/HCQ in combination with zinc should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Derwand, R.; Scholz, M.","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fc6d0cc7622bf841d451576660e32fba71b9a26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202847.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408070/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720306435; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109815; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720306435?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCQ","CQ/HCQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCQ","extracellular zinc","zinc supplementation","zinc deficiency","SARS-CoV","drug repurposing","treatment of COVID","mortality","pH-dependent steps of SARS","novel drug development","antimalarial drug chloroquine","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity","cardiovascular disease","intracellular vesicles","coronavirus replication","intracellular lysosomes","mediated morbidity","clinical studies","elderly patients","clinical trials","chronic pulmonary disease","virus particle delivery","potential candidates","alternative","additional study arm","host cells","diabetes","direct antiviral effects","metabolite hydroxychloroquine","monotherapy","combination"],"language":"en"},

To gain an understanding of the evolution of the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2, we herein analyzed the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we compared the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other viruses belonging to the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae. We found that SARS-CoV-2 has a high AU content that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be better adapted to the human host. We also studied the evolutionary pressures that influence the codon usage of five conserved coronavirus genes encoding the viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and natural selection that affect the codon usage of these genes. Moreover, we show here that the two integral membrane proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), although they are regarded as are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster in comparison to the two genes mentioned above. Overall, our results suggest that the higher divergence observed for the latter three genes could represent a significant barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dilucca, Maddalena; Forcelloni, Sergio; Georgakilas, Alexandros G; Giansanti, Andrea; Pavlopoulou, Athanasia","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32366025/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050498","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["codon usage of SARS","emerging SARS-CoV","codon usage pattern of SARS","corresponding genes","conserved coronavirus genes","spike proteins","nucleocapsid proteins","viral replicase","envelope","integral membrane proteins","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory illness","development of antiviral therapeutics","development of vaccines","antiviral drugs","high mortality rate","high AU content","significant barrier","accumulating nucleotide mutations","matrix","mutational bias","different patterns","important targets","evolutionary pressures","higher divergence","viruses","subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae","results","purpose","human host","Wuhan","China","understanding","comparison","world"],"language":"en"},

The Box\u2013Jenkins method was applied to fit a seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to forecast the incidence of TB over the subsequent six months. RESULTS: During the study period of 144 months, 12,321,559 TB cases were reported in China, with an average monthly incidence of 6.4426 per 100,000 of the population. The monthly incidence of TB showed a clear 12-month cycle, and a seasonality with two peaks occurring in January and March and a trough in December. The best-fit model was SARIMA (1,0,0)(0,1,1)(12), which demonstrated adequate information extraction (white noise test, p \u003E 0.05). Based on the analysis, the incidence of TB from January to June 2016 were 6.6335, 4.7208, 5.8193, 5.5474, 5.2202 and 4.9156 per 100,000 of the population, respectively.

AIM: We estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of COVID-19. We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased. METHODS: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. RESULTS: The mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.78\u20136.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95% CrI: 3.01\u20134.91) for Tianjin. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95% CrI: 32\u201367) for Singapore and 62% (95% CrI: 50\u201376) for Tianjin. Reproduction number estimates based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information. CONCLUSION: High estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ganyani, Tapiwa; Kremer, C\u00E9cile; Chen, Dongxuan; Torneri, Andrea; Faes, Christel; Wallinga, Jacco; Hens, Niel","journal":"Euro Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33a4240a248a314d4b6153c42d81e412fdf994e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201952.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2020.25.17.2000257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Singapore"],"keyphrases":["serial interval estimates","generation interval distribution","serial interval distribution","credible interval","proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission","mean generation interval","proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission","outbreak data","CrI","pre-symptomatic individuals","Reproduction number estimates","reproduction numbers","Singapore","Tianjin","proportion of infections","effective reproduction number of COVID","High estimates","underlying transmission network","symptom onset data","time of data collection","days","incubation period distribution","coronavirus disease","detailed contact tracing information","containment measures","physical distancing measures","key infectious disease parameters","modelling studies","uncertainty","quantities","place","clusters","guiding intervention strategies","China","case","BACKGROUND","order","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","Sensitivity analyses","quarantine","METHODS","AIM"],"language":"en"},

Some patients cannot get effective relief or suffer from serious sequelae. At present, people are studying the role of the innate immune system in viral encephalitis. Microglia, as resident cells of the central nervous system (CNS), can respond quickly to various CNS injuries including trauma, ischemia, and infection and maintain the homeostasis of CNS, but this response is not always good; sometimes, it will exacerbate damage. Studies have shown that microglia also act as a double-edged sword during viral encephalitis. On the one hand, microglia can sense ATP signals through the purinergic receptor P2Y12 and are recruited around infected neurons to exert phagocytic activity. Microglia can exert a direct antiviral effect by producing type 1 interferon (IFN-1) to induce IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression of themselves or indirect antiviral effects by IFN-1 acting on other cells to activate corresponding signaling pathways. In addition, microglia can also exert an antiviral effect by inducing autophagy or secreting cytokines. On the other hand, microglia mediate presynaptic membrane damage in the hippocampus through complement, resulting in long-term memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction in patients with encephalitis. Microglia mediate fetal congenital malformations caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. The gene expression profile of microglia in HIV encephalitis changes, and they tend to be a pro-inflammatory type. Microglia inhibited neuronal autophagy and aggravated the damage of CNS in HIV encephalitis; E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino (pelia) expressed by microglia promotes the replication of virus in neurons. The interaction between amyloid-\u03B2 peptide (A\u03B2) produced by neurons and activated microglia during viral infection is uncertain. Although neurons can mediate antiviral effects by activating receptor-interacting protein kinases 3 (RIPK3) in a death-independent pathway, the RIPK3 pathway of microglia is unknown. Different brain regions have different susceptibility to viruses, and the gene expression of microglia in different brain regions is specific. The relationship between the two needs to be further confirmed. How to properly regulate the function of microglia and make it exert more anti-inflammatory effects is our next research direction.","publish_time":"2019-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Zhuangzhuang; Zhong, Di; Li, Guozhong","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0384ad1acd95e489c5d835a494de1cdd3fd365f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6454758.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967139/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-019-1443-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Microglia"],"organizations":["CNS","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activated microglia","function of microglia","gene expression of microglia","RIPK3 pathway of microglia","gene expression profile of microglia","Viral encephalitis","damage of CNS","viral infection","HIV encephalitis changes","indirect antiviral effects","homeostasis of CNS","infected neurons","Different brain regions","traditional antiviral therapies","IFN-stimulated gene","different susceptibility","various CNS injuries","anti-inflammatory effects","patients","hand","presynaptic membrane damage","Zika virus","resident cells","replication of virus","neuronal autophagy","central nervous system","innate immune system","purinergic receptor P2Y12","death-independent pathway","pro-inflammatory type","E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino","long-term memory impairment","complement","cognitive dysfunction","ATP signals","viruses","fetal congenital malformations","role","hippocampus","A\u03B2","pelia","trauma","ischemia","ISG","amyloid-\u03B2 peptide","effective relief","world","ZIKV","interferon","double-edged sword","protein kinases","secreting cytokines","serious sequelae","interaction","research direction","response","phagocytic activity","shortcomings","present","people","relationship","needs","pathways","Studies","addition"],"language":"en"},

By degrading key host adaptor and signaling molecules, viruses thus disable multiple immune response pathways including the production of and response to interferons as well as other innate host defense mechanisms.

Originally concerned with disease and its emergence, virus evolution had not been well integrated into the general study of evolution. This chapter reviews the developments that have brought us to this new appreciation for the general significance of virus evolution to all life. We now know that viruses numerically dominate all habitats of life, especially the oceans. Theoretical developments in the 1970s regarding quasispecies, error rates, and error thresholds have yielded many practical insights into virus\u2013host dynamics. The human diseases of HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus cannot be understood without this evolutionary framework. Yet recent developments with poliovirus demonstrate that viral fitness can be the result of a consortia, not one fittest type, a basic Darwinian concept in evolutionary biology. Darwinian principles do apply to viruses, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution distinguish virus evolution from classical studies. The available phylogenetic tools have greatly aided our analysis of virus evolution, but these methods struggle to characterize the role of virus populations. Missing from many of these considerations has been the major role played by persisting viruses in stable virus evolution and disease emergence. In many cases, extreme stability is seen with persisting RNA viruses. Indeed, examples are known in which it is the persistently infected host that has better survival. We have also recently come to appreciate the vast diversity of phage (DNA viruses) of prokaryotes as a system that evolves by genetic exchanges across vast populations (Chapter 10). This has been proposed to be the \u201Cbig bang\u201D of biological evolution. In the large DNA viruses of aquatic microbes we see surprisingly large, complex and diverse viruses. With both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses, recombination is the main engine of virus evolution, and virus host co-evolution is common, although not uniform. Viral emergence appears to be an unending phenomenon and we can currently witness a selective sweep by retroviruses that infect and become endogenized in koala bears.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Villarreal, Luis P.","journal":"Origin and Evolution of Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6974a925827dbe9893dcf9f3c8ac0bc69ae7c756.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150326.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123741530000217; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123741530000217","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of virus evolution","stable virus evolution","analysis of virus evolution","virus host co-evolution","general significance of virus evolution","main engine of virus evolution","biological evolution","general study of evolution","role of virus populations","quasispecies-based evolution","diverse viruses","hepatitis C virus","eukaryotic DNA viruses","persisting RNA viruses","large DNA viruses of aquatic microbes","disease emergence","Viral emergence","host dynamics","infected host","vast populations","recent developments","Theoretical developments","chapter","error thresholds","error rates","viral fitness","evolutionary biology","Darwinian principles","major role","habitats of life","evolutionary framework","basic Darwinian concept","vast diversity of phage","recombination","practical insights","features","fittest type","genetic exchanges","extreme stability","classical studies","poliovirus","system","prokaryotes","years","Fisher population genetics","new appreciation","human diseases of HIV","retroviruses","consortia","result","better survival","big bang","methods","available phylogenetic tools","unending phenomenon","selective sweep","koala bears","cases","oceans","considerations","transformation","ABSTRACT","examples"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, the median infectious dose (ID (50))(,) transmission kinetics and pathogenicity of Fr\u2010TCoV were investigated in 10\u2010day\u2010old SPF turkeys. Results revealed a titre of 10(4.88) ID (50)/ml with 1 ID (50)/ml being beyond the limit of genome detection using a well\u2010characterized qRT\u2010PCR for avian coronaviruses. Horizontal transmission of the virus via the airborne route was not observed however, via the oro\u2010faecal route this proved to be extremely rapid (one infectious individual infecting another every 2.5 hr) and infectious virus was excreted for at least 6 weeks in several birds. Histological examination of different zones of the intestinal tract of the Fr\u2010TCoV\u2010infected turkeys showed that the virus had a preference for the lower part of the intestinal tract with an abundance of viral antigen being present in epithelial cells of the ileum, caecum and bursa of Fabricius.

As found in other coronaviruses, the majority of the positive-stranded RNA MERS-CoV genome is translated into two polyproteins, one created by a ribosomal frameshift, that are cleaved at three sites by a papain-like protease and at 11 sites by a 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)). Since 3CL(pro) is essential for viral replication, it is a leading candidate for therapeutic intervention. To accelerate the development of 3CL(pro) inhibitors, three crystal structures of a catalytically inactive variant (C148A) of the MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) enzyme were determined. The aim was to co-crystallize the inactive enzyme with a peptide substrate. Fortuitously, however, in two of the structures the C-terminus of one protomer is bound in the active site of a neighboring molecule, providing a snapshot of an enzyme\u2013product complex. In the third structure, two of the three protomers in the asymmetric unit form a homodimer similar to that of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro); however, the third protomer adopts a radically different conformation that is likely to correspond to a crystallographic monomer, indicative of substantial structural plasticity in the enzyme. The results presented here provide a foundation for the structure-based design of small-molecule inhibitors of the MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) enzyme.","publish_time":"2015-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Needle, Danielle; Lountos, George T.; Waugh, David S.","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section D Biological Crystallography","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b74189968370e6a2e667e06d12e7f6478a5d6ac6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/50e1c748969288afa1e57ac62eefeda7a46dd486.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25945576/; https://doi.org/10.1107/s1399004715003521; http://journals.iucr.org/d/issues/2015/05/00/rr5092/rr5092.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["inactive enzyme","SARS-CoV","positive-stranded RNA MERS-CoV genome","molecule inhibitors","protease","sites","neighboring molecule","inactive variant","crystal structures","C-terminus","severe respiratory illness","structure-based design of small","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","multi-organ dysfunction","crystallographic monomer","indicative of substantial structural plasticity","snapshot","pathogenic virus","leading candidate","homodimer similar","viral replication","asymmetric unit","majority","foundation","active site","C148A","therapeutic intervention","case fatality rate","different conformation","protomers","product complex","polyproteins","peptide substrate","coronaviruses","aim","papain","ribosomal frameshift","results","development"],"language":"en"},

The viable removal efficiency by and relative survivability on the biocidal filters prepared with dialdehyde starch compared to untreated filters were investigated using MS2 bacteriophage at high relative humidity (80\u201390%) and room temperature. Experimental results showed no significant difference in viable removal efficiency and pressure drop between the treated and untreated filters for polypropylene filtering facepiece respirators. The pressure drop of DAS treated cellulose filters significantly decreased although there was no significant change in viable removal efficiency; the combination of these two factors resulted in an increase of filter quality. All biocidal filters showed a significantly lower relative survivability than untreated filters, and the relative survivability decreased as the concentration of DAS increased. The biocidal filter treated with 4% DAS presented an average of 30% survivability compared to the baseline of untreated filters.

Methods PubMed, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scirus, and Scielo were searched (to December 2008) for reports of accidental viral infections, written in English, Portuguese, Spanish, or German; the authors\u2019 personal file of scientific articles and references from the articles retrieved in the initial search were also used. Systematic review was carried out with inclusion criteria of presence of accidental viral infection\u0027s cases information, and exclusion criteria of absence of information about the viral etiology, and at least probable mode of infection. Results One hundred and forty-one scientific articles were obtained, 66 of which were included in the analysis. For arboviruses, 84% of the laboratory infections had aerosol as the source; for alphaviruses alone, aerosol exposure accounted for 94% of accidental infections. Of laboratory arboviral infections, 15.7% were acquired percutaneously, whereas 41.6% of hospital infections were percutaneous. For airborne viruses, 81% of the infections occurred in laboratories, with hantavirus the leading causative agent. Aerosol inhalation was implicated in 96% of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections, 99% of hantavirus infections, and 50% of coxsackievirus infections, but infective droplet inhalation was the leading mode of infection for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the mucocutaneous mode of infection was involved in the case of infection with influenza B. For blood-borne viruses, 92% of infections occurred in hospitals and 93% of these had percutaneous mode of infection, while among laboratory infections 77% were due to infective aerosol inhalation. Among blood-borne virus infections there were six cases of particular note: three cases of acute hepatitis following hepatitis C virus infection with a short period of incubation, one laboratory case of human immunodeficiency virus infection through aerosol inhalation, one case of hepatitis following hepatitis G virus infection, and one case of fulminant hepatitis with hepatitis B virus infection following exposure of the worker\u0027s conjunctiva to hepatitis B virus e antigen-negative patient saliva. Of the 12 infections with viruses with preferential mucocutaneous transmission, seven occurred percutaneously, aerosol was implicated as a possible source of infection in two cases, and one atypical infection with Macacine herpesvirus 1 with fatal encephalitis as the outcome occurred through a louse bite. One outbreak of norovirus infection among hospital staff had as its probable mode of infection the ingestion of inocula spread in the environment by fomites. Conclusions The currently accepted and practiced risk analysis of accidental viral infections based on the conventional dynamics of infection of the etiological agents is insufficient to cope with accidental viral infections in laboratories and to a lesser extent in hospitals, where unconventional modes of infection are less frequently present but still have relevant clinical and potential epidemiological consequences. Unconventional modes of infection, atypical clinical development, or extremely severe cases are frequently present together with high viral loads and high virulence of the agents manipulated in laboratories.

We previously generated an attenuated viral variant, YAC-MHV3, which induces a subclinical disease and recovery within 15 days. In contrast, the L2-MHV3 strain induces the development of a fulminant hepatitis, leading to death within 3 days. In this paper, we document intrahepatic and splenic T cell subpopulations involved in the hepatitis process and viral elimination identified in attenuated or pathogenic MHV3-infected C57BL/6 mice. Percentages of intrahepatic CD4\u002B cells decreased in attenuated YAC-MHV3-infected mice, while they increased in mice infected with pathogenic L2-MHV3, compared with uninfected animals. Moreover, in YAC-MHV3-infected mice, the percentages of intrahepatic CD8\u002B cells slightly decreased at 24 h pi, then increased until 15 days pi. In contrast, the CD4/CD8 ratios of splenic lymphoid subpopulations increased in the first days of infection and returned to normal values at 15 days pi. Intrahepatic NK1.1\u002B\u03B1\u03B2 \u2212 TCRinter cells decreased in both virally infected groups of mice, while CD4\u002B\u03B1\u03B2 \u2212 TCRinter LFA-1high cells increased in L2-MHV3-infected mice, in contrast with what was seen in YAC-MHV3-infected mice. However, these cells became anergic following Con A or PHA stimulation. Ex vivo studies showed that only the intrahepatic CD8\u002B cells that were increased in YAC-MHV3-infected mice could be stimulated by lectins. In addition, in vitro viral infections revealed that L2-MHV3 viral infection led to an increase of intrahepatic CD4\u002B\u03B1\u03B2 \u2212 TCRinter cells in the absence of CD8\u002B cells only. These results indicate that the attenuated phenotype of the YAC-MHV3 virus is related to two different mechanisms: the first involves no increase of intrahepatic CD4\u002B\u03B1\u03B2 \u2212 TCRinter or NK-T cells, while the second favors the recruitment and activation of CD8\u002B cells in liver.

A total of 1,482 healthy Holstein heifer and bull calves from a large California dairy were enrolled at 24 to 48 hours of age until hutch exit at approximately 90 days of age. Calves were block-randomized by time to one of three treatments: 1) placebo, 2) zinc methionine (ZM), or 3) zinc sulfate (ZS) administered in milk once daily for 14 days. Serum total protein at enrollment and body weight at birth, treatment end, and hutch exit were measured. Fecal consistency was assessed daily for 28 days post-enrollment. For a random sample of 127 calves, serum zinc concentrations before and after treatment and a fecal antigen ELISA at diarrhea start and resolution for Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum were performed. Linear regression showed that ZM-treated bull calves had 22 g increased ADG compared to placebo-treated bulls (P = 0.042). ZM-treated heifers had 9 g decreased ADG compared to placebo-treated heifers (P = 0.037), after adjusting for average birth weight. Sex-stratified models showed that high birth weight heifers treated with ZM gained more than placebo-treated heifers of the same birth weight, which suggests a dose-response effect rather than a true sex-specific effect of ZM on ADG. Cox regression showed that ZM and ZS-treated calves had a 14.7% (P = 0.015) and 13.9% (P = 0.022) reduced hazard of diarrhea, respectively, compared to placebo-treated calves. Calves supplemented for at least the first five days of diarrhea with ZM and ZS had a 21.4% (P = 0.027) and 13.0% (P = 0.040) increased hazard of cure from diarrhea, respectively, compared to placebo-treated calves. Logistic regression showed that the odds of microbiological cure at diarrhea resolution for rotavirus, C. parvum, or any single fecal pathogen was not different between treatment groups. Zinc supplementation delayed diarrhea and expedited diarrhea recovery in pre-weaned calves. Additionally, zinc improved weight gain differentially in bulls compared to heifers, indicating a research need for sex-specific dosing.","publish_time":"2019-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feldmann, Hillary R.; Williams, Deniece R.; Champagne, John D.; Lehenbauer, Terry W.; Aly, Sharif S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef20a0cd67ce018cf061f154bd8be9d0e58d0f23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6619766.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291305/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219321","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":["ZM","ZS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["placebo-treated calves","ZS-treated calves","ZM-treated bull calves","ZM-treated heifers","placebo-treated heifers","days of diarrhea","placebo-treated bulls","diarrhea resolution","hazard of diarrhea","pre-weaned calves","Zinc supplementation delayed diarrhea","high birth weight heifers","average birth weight","pre-weaned dairy calves","body weight","zinc sulfate","zinc methionine","expedited diarrhea recovery","average daily weight gain","improved weight gain","true sex-specific effect of ZM","effectiveness of zinc supplementation","serum zinc concentrations","days of age","g increased ADG","days post-enrollment","rotavirus","treatment end","treatment groups","sex-specific dosing","Cox regression","Linear regression","Fecal consistency","Logistic regression","hazard of cure","hutch exit","Sex-stratified models","Serum total protein","single fecal pathogen","fecal antigen ELISA","Cryptosporidium parvum","hours of age","odds of microbiological cure","dose-response effect","large California dairy","coronavirus","Escherichia coli K99","healthy Holstein heifer","research need","random sample","clinical trial","time","milk","objective","treatments","block"],"language":"en"},

However, early forecasts are generally unreliable as little information is available in the first few incidence data points. Here, we show how past Aedes-transmitted epidemics help improve these predictions. The approach was applied to the 2015-2017 Zika virus epidemics in three islands of the French West Indies, with historical data including other Aedes-transmitted diseases (Chikungunya and Zika) in the same and other locations. Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of final epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions. Improvements were more limited for the date of peak incidence and the total duration of the epidemic.

We also show that betweenness centrality is a poor filter for journals with a narrow focus and a good filter for multidisciplinary journals where communities of papers can be identified.","publish_time":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diallo, Saikou Y.; Lynch, Christopher J.; Gore, Ross; Padilla, Jose J.","journal":"Scientometrics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23c3a53f431fa237d8ecc3d16391f083582eacd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088853.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1891-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Public Library of Science"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["network of papers","closeness centrality","betweenness centrality","eigenvector centrality","poor filter","existing network centrality measures","established centrality metrics","good filter","effective filter","communities of papers","set of papers","given journal","co-citation network","article-level metrics","dataset of published papers","multidisciplinary journals","PLOS","narrow focus","compute","Public Library of Science","articles","extent","relative importance","scale-free","small range of citations","filters","results"],"language":"en"},

(Saururaceae; HC) has been long used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of inflammation diseases. Modern research has implicated inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as a key regulator of the inflammatory process. Aim of the study In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of HC on COX-2. We examined the effects of HC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin (PG) E2 production, an indirect indicator of COX-2 activity, and COX-2 gene and protein expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Materials and methods LPS-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages were employed as an in vitro model system. LPS-induced PGE2 production was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and COX-2 protein expression was assessed by Western blot assay. Results The results showed that HC was able to inhibit the release of LPS-induced PGE2 from mouse peritoneal macrophages (IC50 value: 44.8\u03BCg/mL). Moreover, the inhibitory activity of HC essential oil elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity (IC50 value: 30.9\u03BCg/mL). HC was also found to cause reduction in LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, but did not affect COX-1 expression. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and specific COX-2 inhibitor NS398 functioned similarly in LPS-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages. Conclusion Taken together, our data suggest HC mediates inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity and can affect related gene and protein expression. HC works by a mechanism of action similar to that of NSAIDs. These results add a novel aspect to the biological profile of HC.","publish_time":"2011-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Weifeng; Zhou, Ping; Zhang, Yanmin; He, Langchong","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/280a4a3959ef04e44e0af1c3c1f9eb5ce45463c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127187.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.10.048; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874110007580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21073936/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874110007580","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LPS-induced COX","specific COX","effects of HC","effect of HC","protein expression","methods LPS-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages","LPS-induced PGE2 production","indirect indicator of COX","biological profile of HC","induced prostaglandin","enzyme activity","release of LPS","dose-dependent inhibition of COX","inhibitory activity of HC essential oil","results","IC50 value","\u03BCg","enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay","related gene","present study","Western blot assay","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Houttuynia cordata Thunb","non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","lipopolysaccharide","mRNA","novel aspect","inhibitor NS398","traditional oriental medicine","treatment of inflammation diseases","inducible cyclooxygenase","Materials","reduction","key regulator","mechanism of action similar","inflammatory process","Modern research","NSAIDs","model system","Conclusion","Saururaceae"],"language":"en"},

This difference is incident to the nonlinear terms in the master equation, and we show that the deviation away from the expectation of the extrinsic noise scales nonlinearly with the variance of the distribution. The method presented here converges linearly with respect to the number of particles in the system and exponentially with respect to the order of the polynomials used in the stochastic collocation calculation. This makes the method presented here more accurate than standard Monte Carlo methods, which suffer from slow, nonmonotonic convergence. In epidemiological terms, the results show that extrinsic fluctuations should be taken into account since they effect the speed of disease breakouts and that the gamma distribution should be used to model the basic reproductive number.","publish_time":"2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bayati, Basil S.","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8521fd293492e0dfecdb6cd2163f2e4abbd5852.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217500.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27300847/; https://doi.org/10.1103/physreve.93.052124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extrinsic noise scales","stochastic collocation method","extrinsic fluctuations","gamma distribution","canonical epidemiological master equation","epidemiological terms","expectation","intrinsic noise","stochastic collocation calculation","respect","stochastic parameter","nonlinear terms","different results","number of particles","basic reproductive number","analytical expansion","effects","polynomials","standard Monte Carlo methods","variance","speed of disease breakouts","difference","incident","account","system","nonmonotonic convergence","order","deviation"],"language":"en"},

To determine if TRTV belongs to one of the three defined genera of this family (Paramyxovirus, Morbillivirus and Pneumovirus) we have analysed the RNA and proteins induced during replication of TRTV in Vero cells. Following replication in the presence of actinomycin D 10 polyadenylated RNA bands, ranging in M r from 0.22 to 2.0 \u00D7 106, were detected in infected cells; some bands probably contained 2 or more RNA species. Viral proteins were studied after radiolabelling in the presence of [35S]methionine and [3H]glucosamine. Comparison of the polypeptides in mock-infected and infected cells, virions and nucleocapsids and after lentil-lectin chromatography and immunoprecipitation revealed seven virus-specific polypeptides (p), some of which were glycosylated (gp): gp82 (M r 82K), gp68, gp53, gp15, p43, p40 and p35. These are considered to be analogous to the large glycopolypeptide (HN, H and G), fusion protein precursor F0, the F protein cleavage products F1 and F2, nucleocapsid (N), phosphorylated (P) and matrix (M) polypeptides, respectively, of the Paramyxoviridae. Two other polypeptides (M r 200K and 22K) were also detected, as was a glycopolypeptide of M r 97K, probably related to gp82. Tunicamycin inhibited glycosylation of gp53 and gp15 but gp82 was little affected, most glycans still being present on a glycopolypeptide of approximately 79K. This finding, indicating that gp82 has mostly O-linked glycans, considered with the mRNA profile and the molecular weight of the N protein shows that of the three genera in this family, TRTV most closely resembles the Pneumovirus genus.","publish_time":"1988-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cavanagh, David; Barrett, Thomas","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2615a8099cee9f6064c58337632ea7fd068f0a10.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016817028890086X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016817028890086X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TRTV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gp82","infected cells","replication of TRTV","Paramyxoviridae family","virus-specific polypeptides","gp15","mock-infected","polyadenylated RNA bands","Vero cells","RNA species","large glycopolypeptide","fusion protein precursor F0","defined genera","Pneumovirus genus","Viral proteins","F protein cleavage products F1","turkey rhinotracheitis virus","presence of actinomycin D","O-linked glycans","Tunicamycin inhibited glycosylation of gp53","F2","immunoprecipitation","nucleocapsids","causative agent","acute repiratory disease","lentil-lectin chromatography","p43","HN","molecular weight","Paramyxovirus","virions","mRNA profile","turkeys","methionine","p40","member","gp68","Abstract Electronmicroscopy","p35","Morbillivirus","glucosamine","Comparison","matrix"],"language":"en"},

Here we screened a collection of 16671 diverse compounds for anti-human coronavirus 229E activity and identified an inhibitor, designated K22, that specifically targets membrane-bound coronaviral RNA synthesis. K22 exerts most potent antiviral activity after virus entry during an early step of the viral life cycle. Specifically, the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), a hallmark of coronavirus replication, was greatly impaired upon K22 treatment accompanied by near-complete inhibition of viral RNA synthesis. K22-resistant viruses contained substitutions in non-structural protein 6 (nsp6), a membrane-spanning integral component of the viral replication complex implicated in DMV formation, corroborating that K22 targets membrane bound viral RNA synthesis. Besides K22 resistance, the nsp6 mutants induced a reduced number of DMVs, displayed decreased specific infectivity, while RNA synthesis was not affected. Importantly, K22 inhibits a broad range of coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2013CoV), and efficient inhibition was achieved in primary human epithelia cultures representing the entry port of human coronavirus infection. Collectively, this study proposes an evolutionary conserved step in the life cycle of positive-stranded RNA viruses, the recruitment of cellular membranes for viral replication, as vulnerable and, most importantly, druggable target for antiviral intervention. We expect this mode of action to serve as a paradigm for the development of potent antiviral drugs to combat many animal and human virus infections.","publish_time":"2014-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lundin, Anna; Dijkman, Ronald; Bergstr\u00F6m, Tomas; Kann, Nina; Adamiak, Beata; Hannoun, Charles; Kindler, Eveline; J\u00F3nsd\u00F3ttir, Hulda R.; Muth, Doreen; Kint, Joeri; Forlenza, Maria; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Drosten, Christian; Thiel, Volker; Trybala, Edward","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17dbd5741595c1e5b7508063b31147be9263e7f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4038610.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874215/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004166","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","DMV"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["K22 targets membrane","designated K22","K22 resistance","K22 treatment","K22-resistant viruses","complete inhibition of viral RNA synthesis","membrane-bound coronaviral RNA synthesis","stranded RNA viruses","anti-human coronavirus","viral life cycle","viral replication complex","potent antiviral activity","hallmark of coronavirus replication","antiviral intervention","entry port of human coronavirus infection","human virus infections","specific antiviral drugs available","development of potent antiviral drugs","virus entry","formation of double membrane vesicles","primary human epithelia cultures","emerging zoonotic viruses","life cycle of positive","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","early step","E activity","DMV formation","nsp6 mutants","efficient inhibition","decreased specific infectivity","reduced number of DMVs","evolutionary conserved step","broad range of coronaviruses","MERS","recruitment of cellular membranes","CoV","substitutions","animal","serious concerns","diverse compounds","non-structural protein","integral component","paradigm","inhibitor","druggable target","collection","study","mode of action"],"language":"en"},

The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3\u0027 end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the Fend and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 by downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 by from the 3\u0027 terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3\u0027 third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the Fend encoding nonstructural and the 3\u0027 end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27\u201334 nm.

L(pro) self-cleaves from the nascent viral polyprotein precursor as the first mature viral protein. In addition to its role as a viral proteinase, L(pro) also has the ability to antagonize host antiviral effects. To promote FMDV replication, L(pro) can suppress host antiviral responses by three different mechanisms: (1) cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 \u03B3 (eIF4G) to shut off host protein synthesis; (2) inhibition of host innate immune responses through restriction of interferon-\u03B1/\u03B2 production; and (3) L(pro) can also act as a deubiquitinase and catalyze deubiquitination of innate immune signaling molecules.

Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS will be enrolled in this recursive, two-stage, group sequential, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial. The trial is initially designed to include 2 two-stage components. The first two-stage component is designed to adjust sample size and determine futility stopping, but not efficacy stopping.

The aim of this study was to qualify and quantify bioaerosol concentrations during bronchoscopy to estimate the occupational risk. Methods Full-day sampling was conducted in 2 rooms while bronchoscopies were performed on patients. Two microbial air samplers were used, a wet wall cyclonic sampler and an impactor, on culture media. Identification of the culturable bacterial flora was performed with chromatographic analysis of cellular fatty acid of the isolated strain and additional biochemical tests if needed. Specific polymerase chain reaction analysis was completed on wet wall cyclonic samples for the detection of influenza A and B and Mycobacterium spp. Results A wide variety of bacteria were collected from the ambient air. All samples yielded at least 1 Staphylococcus species. Although most of the culturable bacteria identified were normal nonpathogenic flora, such as Streptococcus spp, Neisseria spp, and Corynebacterium spp, some opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, were found.

METHODS: We recruited 103 GrippeWeb participants (73 adults and 30 children) and provided them with a kit, instructions and a questionnaire for each sample. In the first half of 2016, participants took an anterior nasal swab and sent it to the Robert Koch Institute whenever an acute respiratory illness occurred. Reporting of illnesses through the GrippeWeb platform continued as usual. We analysed swabs for the presence of human c\u2010myc\u2010DNA and 22 viral and bacterial pathogens. After the study, we sent participants an evaluation questionnaire. We analysed timeliness, completeness, acceptability and validity. RESULTS: One hundred and two participants submitted 225 analysable swabs. Ninety per cent of swabs were taken within 3 days of symptom onset. Eighty\u2010nine per cent of swabs had a corresponding reported illness in the GrippeWeb system. Ninety\u2010nine per cent of adults and 96% of children would be willing to participate in a self\u2010swabbing scheme for a longer period. All swabs contained c\u2010myc\u2010DNA.

Many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support. Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high. Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true among the patient population over 65. Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress. We hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent/efferent neurons) in the lungs. TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression. We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes. We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nahama, Alexis; Ramachandran, Roshni; Cisternas, Alvaro Francisco; Ji, Henry","journal":"Med Drug Discov","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95c6d5ce886f212e2690926de5dfa41cb65a2d7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147194.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590098620300208?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292906/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590098620300208","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high mortality","advanced pulmonary disease","patients","reduced mortality","mortality rates","major causes of mortality","rapid disease progression","ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist","entire pulmonary system","advanced COVID","lungs","possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways","fatal respiratory distress","intensive care unit","osteoarthritis pain","pain transmission","neuronal system","Abstract Acute respiratory distress","better overall outcomes","clinical trials","viral infection","storm","inflammation","expected fatality","immunomodulation","cancer","immune signal activity","efferent neurons","RTX","processes","nerve fibers","afferent","localized cytokine release","late stage SARS-CoV","Historical data outlook points","best efforts","therapeutic approaches","cells","ventilatory support","physiological events","use of resiniferatoxin","patient population","Novel life","strategies","morbidity","severity"],"language":"en"},

The 5\u0027 two-thirds of the genome encodes non-structural proteins that are required for virus replication and synthesis of subgenomic (SG) mRNA for structural proteins. SG-mRNA is generated by internal initiation at the SG-promoter that is located at the complementary minus-strand template. Different types of expression systems including replication-competent vectors, which represent alphavirus genomes with inserted expression units, have been developed. The replication-competent vectors represent useful tools for studying alphaviruses and have potential therapeutic applications. In both cases, the properties of the vector, such as its genetic stability and expression level of the protein of interest, are important. RESULTS: We analysed 14 candidates of replication-competent vectors based on the genome of an SFV4 isolate that contained a duplicated SG promoter or an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-element controlled marker gene. It was found that the IRES elements and the minimal -21 to \u002B5 SG promoter were non-functional in the context of these vectors. The efficient SG promoters contained at least 26 residues upstream of the start site of SG mRNA. The insertion site of the SG promoter and its length affected the genetic stability of the vectors, which was always higher when the SG promoter was inserted downstream of the coding region for structural proteins. The stability also depended on the conditions used for vector propagation. A procedure based on the in vitro transcription of ligation products was used for generation of replication-competent vector-based expression libraries that contained hundreds of thousands of different genomes, and maintained genetic diversity and the ability to express inserted genes over five passages in cell culture. CONCLUSION: The properties of replication-competent vectors of alphaviruses depend on the details of their construction. In the case of SFV4, such vectors should contain the SG promoter with structural characteristics for this isolate. The main factor for instability of SFV4-based replication-competent vectors was the deletion of genes of interest, since the resulting shorter genomes had a growth advantage over the original vector.","publish_time":"2009-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rausalu, Kai; Iofik, Anna; \u00DClper, Liane; Karo-Astover, Liis; Lulla, Valeria; Merits, Andres","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cc0661e4cf8ff7c398468edba4e7d71be299647.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2669057.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-33; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19317912/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SG-promoter","SG-mRNA","based replication-competent vectors","duplicated SG promoter","competent vectors of alphaviruses","virus replication","properties of replication","start site of SG mRNA","generation of replication","candidates of replication","efficient SG promoters","competent vector-based expression libraries","different genomes","genetic stability","inserted expression units","expression level","inserted genes","original vector","vector propagation","Different types of expression systems","alphavirus genomes","insertion site","genetic diversity","instability of SFV4","non-structural proteins","structural characteristics","case of SFV4","isolate","internal ribosomal entry site","positive strand RNA genome","different cells of vertebrates","resulting shorter genomes","internal initiation","deletion of genes","IRES elements","Semliki Forest virus","complementary minus-strand template","growth advantage","hundreds of thousands","useful tools","synthesis of subgenomic","residues","element controlled marker gene","BACKGROUND","passages","context","length","cell culture","main factor","coding region","transcription of ligation products","potential therapeutic applications","invertebrates","thirds","conditions","details","cases","CONCLUSION","procedure","construction","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, the causative mutation in a phospholipase D4 encoding gene (PLD4) shows no connection to zinc metabolism. OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical signs, laboratory variables, and pathological findings of ZDL syndrome and their utility to differentiate ZDL from BHZD and infectious diseases with similar phenotype. ANIMALS: Nine hospitalized calves with crusting dermatitis and confirmed mutation in PLD4 and medical records from 25 calves with crusting dermatitis or suspected zinc deficiency. METHODS: Prospective and retrospective case series. RESULTS: The 9 calves (age: 5\u201353 weeks) displayed a moderate to severe crusting dermatitis mainly on the head, ventrum, and joints. Respiratory and digestive tract inflammations were frequently observed. Zinc supplementation did not lead to remission of clinical signs in 4 calves. Laboratory variables revealed slight anemia in 8 calves, hypoalbuminemia in 6 calves, but reduced serum zinc concentrations in only 3 calves. Mucosal erosions/ulcerations were present in 7 calves and thymus atrophy or reduced thymic weights in 8 calves. Histologically, skin lesions were indistinguishable from BHZD. Retrospective analysis of medical records revealed the presence of this phenotype since 1988 and pedigree analysis revealed a common ancestor of several affected calves. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: ZDL syndrome should be suspected in Fleckvieh calves with crusting dermatitis together with diarrhea or respiratory tract inflammations without response to oral zinc supplementation. Definite diagnosis requires molecular genetic confirmation of the PLD4 mutation.","publish_time":"2018-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Langenmayer, M.C.; Jung, S.; Majzoub\u2010Altweck, M.; Trefz, F.M.; Seifert, C.; Knubben\u2010Schweizer, G.; Fries, R.; Hermanns, W.; Gollnick, N.S.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e3f1f1b1f7f02523bc38fc9a0c321d1ccc9e1b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5866964.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29424482/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.15040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BHZD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized calves","affected calves","inherited defect of Fleckvieh calves","suspected zinc deficiency","oral zinc supplementation","severe crusting dermatitis","PLD4 mutation","BHZD","bovine hereditary zinc deficiency","reduced serum zinc concentrations","pathological findings of ZDL syndrome","confirmed mutation","respiratory tract inflammations","Retrospective analysis of medical records","causative mutation","laboratory variables","remission of clinical signs","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","digestive tract inflammations","pedigree analysis","similar phenotype","retrospective case series","striking similarity","response","diarrhea","molecular genetic confirmation","thymus atrophy","phospholipase D4","common ancestor","head","infectious diseases","slight anemia","hypoalbuminemia","utility","thymic weights","Definite diagnosis","METHODS","ulcerations","presence","CONCLUSIONS","Mucosal erosions","weeks","skin lesions","connection","ventrum","age","ANIMALS","joints","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","metabolism"],"language":"en"},

Like several other viruses, LDV causes widespread and very rapid but transient activation of both B cells and T cells in lymphoid tissues and the blood. The mechanism of this activation has not been fully described and is the focus of the current studies. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A known inducer of early lymphocyte activation is IFN\u03B1, a cytokine strongly induced by LDV infection. Neutralization of IFN\u03B1 in the plasma from infected mice ablated its ability to activate lymphocytes in vitro. Since the primary source of virus-induced IFN\u03B1 in vivo is often plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC\u0027s), we depleted these cells prior to LDV infection and tested for lymphocyte activation. Depletion of pDC\u0027s in vivo eradicated both the LDV-induced IFN\u03B1 response and lymphocyte activation. A primary receptor in pDC\u0027s for single stranded RNA viruses such as LDV is the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) pattern recognition receptor. Infection of TLR7-knockout mice revealed that both the IFN\u03B1 response and lymphocyte activation were dependent on TLR7 signaling in vivo. Interestingly, virus levels in both TLR7 knockout mice and pDC-depleted mice were indistinguishable from controls indicating that LDV is largely resistant to the systemic IFN\u03B1 response. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that LDV-induced activation of lymphocytes is due to recognition of LDV nucleic acid by TLR7 pattern recognition receptors in pDC\u0027s that respond with a lymphocyte-inducing IFN\u03B1 response.","publish_time":"2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ammann, Christoph G.; Messer, Ronald J.; Peterson, Karin E.; Hasenkrug, Kim J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7b16abf574515b631f758dc51170ef757fd58b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2699471.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19568424/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006105","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LDV-induced IFN\u03B1 response","LDV infection","LDV-induced activation of lymphocytes","TLR7 knockout mice","transient activation","Neutralization of IFN\u03B1","systemic IFN\u03B1 response","Infection of TLR7","recognition of LDV nucleic acid","infected mice","known inducer of early lymphocyte activation","TLR7 pattern recognition receptors","pDC-depleted mice","B cells","T cells","primary receptor","Depletion of pDC\u0027s","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","natural infectious agent of mice","virus levels","primary source of virus","Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus","single stranded RNA viruses","lymphoid tissues","controls","cytokine","BACKGROUND","ability","Results","toll","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","blood","focus","current studies","CONCLUSION","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of PEMF stimulation on the prevention of steroid-induced osteonecrosis in rats and explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Seventy-two male adult Wistar rats were divided into three groups and treated as follows. (1) PEMF stimulation group (PEMF group, n = 24): intravenously injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 \u03BCg/kg) on day 0 and intramuscularly injected with methylprednisolone acetate (MPSL, 20 mg/kg) on days 1, 2 and 3, then subjected to PEMF stimulation 4 h per day for 1 to 8 weeks. (2) Methylprednisolone-treated group (MPSL group, n = 24): injected the same dose of LPS and MPSL as the PEMF group but without exposure to PEMF. (3) Control group (PS group, n = 24): injected 0.9% saline in the same mode at the same time points. The incidence of osteonecrosis, serum lipid levels and the mRNA and protein expression of transforming growth factor \u03B21 (TGF-\u03B21) in the proximal femur were measured 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the last MPSL (or saline) injection. RESULTS: The incidence of osteonecrosis in the PEMF group (29%) was significantly lower than that observed in the MPSL group (75%), while no osteonecrosis was observed in the PS group. The serum lipid levels were significantly lower in the PEMF and PS groups than in the MPSL group. Compared with the MPSL and PS groups, the mRNA expression of TGF-\u03B21 increased, reaching a peak 1 week after PEMF treatment, and remained high for 4 weeks, then declined at 8 weeks, whereas the protein expression of TGF-\u03B21 increased, reaching a peak at 2 weeks after PEMF treatment, and remained high for 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: PEMF stimulation can prevent steroid-induced osteonecrosis in rats, and the underlying mechanisms involve decreased serum lipid levels and increased expression of TGF-\u03B21.","publish_time":"2011-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Shuai; Peng, Hao; Fang, Hong-Song; Zhou, Jian-Lin; Wang, Zhe","journal":"BMC Musculoskelet Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/121f06c44cde088607a6f4d16098eb6101513c01.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3192716.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2474-12-215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21958301/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEMF","MPSL","PS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEMF group","PEMF stimulation group","MPSL group","PEMF treatment","effects of PEMF stimulation","Control group","weeks","Methylprednisolone-treated group","TGF-\u03B21","incidence of osteonecrosis","steroid-induced osteonecrosis","increased expression of TGF","PS groups","mRNA expression of TGF","protein expression of TGF","femoral head osteonecrosis","decreased serum lipid levels","protein expression of transforming growth factor \u03B21","prevention of steroid","underlying mechanisms","peak","saline","male adult Wistar rats","methylprednisolone acetate","dose of LPS","Pulsed electromagnetic fields","METHODS","nonunion fractures","BACKGROUND","mode","\u03BCg","CONCLUSIONS","exposure","proximal femur","time points","study","lipopolysaccharide","injection","RESULTS","purpose","days"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated the performance of the PowerChek MERS (upE \u0026 ORF1a) real-time PCR Kit (PowerChek MERS assay; Kogene Biotech, Korea) a one-step rRT-PCR assay for the qualitative detection of MERS-CoV. METHODS: We evaluated PowerChek MERS assay performance in comparison with nested RT-PCR and sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes. To evaluate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, 100 clinical specimens (50 positive and 50 negative for MERS-CoV) were simultaneously tested by using the PowerChek MERS and sequencing assays. Assay performance, including limit of detection and precision, was evaluated in vitro by using MERS-CoV RNA transcripts. Analytical specificity was evaluated with a diverse collection of 16 respiratory virus\u2013positive clinical specimens and 14 respiratory bacterial isolates. RESULTS: The 95% limits of detection of the PowerChek MERS assay for the upE and the open rading frame (ORF)1a were 16.2 copies/\u00B5L and 8.2 copies/\u00B5L, respectively.

The aim of this study was to examine the presence and significance of bacteria and viruses in the upper respiratory tract of healthcare workers (HCWs), and association with respiratory symptoms. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in China and 223 HCWs were recruited from fever clinics and respiratory, paediatric, emergency/Intensive medication wards. Participants were followed over 4 weeks (7th May 2015 to 4th June 2015) for development of clinical respiratory illness (CRI). Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study. The primary endpoints were laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation and viral respiratory infection. Rates of the following infections in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants were compared at the start or end of the study; 1) all bacterial/viral infections, 2) bacterial infection and bacterial-viral co-infections, excluding virus only infections, and 3) only bacterial infections. RESULTS: Bacterial colonisation was identified in 88% (196/223) of participants at the start or end of the study. Among these participants, 66% (148/223) had only bacterial colonisation while 22% (48/223) had co-infection with a virus. Bacteria were isolated from 170 (76.2%) participants at baseline and 127 (57%) participants at the end of the study. Laboratory confirmed viral infections were identified in 53 (23.8%) participants - 35 (15.7%) at the baseline and 20 (9.0%) at the end of the study. CRI symptoms were recorded in 12 participants (4.5%) and all had a positive bacterium isolation at baseline (n = 11) or end of the study (n = 1). Among asymptomatic participants, 187 (87%) had bacterial colonisation or bacterial/viral co-infection at baseline or end of the study. Viruses were also isolated from 5 (2.4%) asymptomatic cases. Rates of all infection outcomes were higher in symptomatic participants, however differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: We isolated high rates of bacteria and viruses in the upper respiratory tract of hospital HCWs, which may reflect greater exposure to respiratory infections in the hospital. Although respiratory infections are mostly symptomatic, the association between bacterial colonization and symptomatic illness is not clear. In the healthcare setting, HCWs may acquire and transmit infection to patients and other HCWs around them. Larger studies are required to explore ongoing occupational risk of respiratory infection in hospitals HCWs.","publish_time":"2017-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raina MacIntyre, C.; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Zhang, Yi; Seale, Holly; Yang, Peng; Chen, Joshua; Pan, Yang; Zhang, Daitao; Wang, Quanyi","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a59fdbfef640d08b4729060ee005ff35f87c0a40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5550936.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-017-2649-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28793861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["bacterial infections","respiratory infections","Bacterial colonisation","viral respiratory infection","bacterial-viral co-infections","viral infections","asymptomatic participants","bacterial colonization","respiratory symptoms","baseline","upper respiratory tract of hospital HCWs","following infections","ongoing occupational risk of respiratory infection","infection outcomes","development of clinical respiratory illness","upper respiratory tract of healthcare workers","prospective cohort study","hospitals HCWs","symptomatic illness","viruses","significance of bacteria","high rates of bacteria","association","laboratory","start","CRI symptoms","clinical significance","asymptomatic cases","healthcare setting","emergency","greater exposure","Intensive medication wards","fever clinics","positive bacterium isolation","differences","China","presence","primary endpoints","METHODS","BACKGROUND","Larger studies","CONCLUSION","Nasopharyngeal swabs","patients","RESULTS","aim","weeks"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to explore the status of resilience among tertiary hospitals in Shandong Province, China. METHODS: A stratified random sample (n = 50) was derived from tertiary A, tertiary B, and tertiary C hospitals in Shandong Province, and was surveyed by questionnaire. Data on hospital characteristics and 8 key domains of hospital resilience were collected and analysed. Variables were binary, and analysed using descriptive statistics such as frequencies. RESULTS: A response rate of 82% (n = 41) was attained. Factor analysis identified four key factors from eight domains which appear to reflect the overall level of disaster resilience. These were hospital safety, disaster management mechanisms, disaster resources and disaster medical care capability. The survey demonstrated that in regard to hospital safety, 93% had syndromic surveillance systems for infectious diseases and 68% had evaluated their safety standards. In regard to disaster management mechanisms, all had general plans, while only 20% had specific plans for individual hazards. 49% had a public communication protocol and 43.9% attended the local coordination meetings. In regard to disaster resources, 75.6% and 87.5% stockpiled emergency drugs and materials respectively, while less than a third (30%) had a signed Memorandum of Understanding with other hospitals to share these resources. Finally in regard to medical care, 66% could dispatch an on-site medical rescue team, but only 5% had a \u2018portable hospital\u2019 function and 36.6% and 12% of the hospitals could surge their beds and staff capacity respectively. The average beds surge capacity within 1 day was 13%. CONCLUSIONS: This study validated the broad utility of a framework for understanding and measuring the level of hospital resilience. The survey demonstrated considerable variability in disaster resilience arrangements of tertiary hospitals in Shandong province, and the difference between tertiary A hospitals and tertiary B hospitals was also identified in essential areas.","publish_time":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Shuang; Hou, Xiang-Yu; Clark, Michele; Zang, Yu-Li; Wang, Lu; Xu, Ling-Zhong; FitzGerald, Gerard","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5f9caf3c407fae4690cd853b95d3c3e9b0a8b5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3987831.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-14-135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661641/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Hospital disaster resilience","disaster resilience arrangements of tertiary hospitals","disaster resources","tertiary B hospitals","tertiary C hospitals","level of hospital resilience","hospital safety","overall level of disaster resilience","key domains of hospital resilience","disaster management mechanisms","hospital characteristics","portable hospital","regard","disaster medical care capability","status of resilience","Shandong Province","survey","safety standards","study","key factors","on-site medical rescue team","general plans","specific plans","average beds","staff capacity","signed Memorandum of Understanding","considerable variability","syndromic surveillance systems","difference","infectious diseases","stratified random sample","China","broad utility","binary","descriptive statistics","shock of disasters","critical functions","stockpiled emergency drugs","materials","METHODS","response rate","individual hazards","framework","Factor analysis","day","Data","BACKGROUND","essential areas","public communication protocol","local coordination meetings","original state","frequencies","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","hospital\u2019s ability","Variables","questionnaire"],"language":"en"},

HEV infections are the common cause of acute hepatitis but can also take chronic courses. Ribavirin is the treatment of choice for most patients and type I interferon (IFN) has been evaluated in a few infected transplantation patients in vivo. However, no effective and specific treatments against HEV infections are currently available. In this study, we evaluated the natural compound silvestrol, isolated from the plant Aglaia foveolata, and known for its specific inhibition of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A in state-of-the-art HEV experimental model systems. Silvestrol blocked HEV replication of different subgenomic replicons in a dose-dependent manner at low nanomolar concentrations and acted additive to ribavirin (RBV). In addition, HEV p6-based full length replication and production of infectious particles was reduced in the presence of silvestrol. A pangenotypic effect of the compound was further demonstrated with primary isolates from four different human genotypes in HEV infection experiments of hepatocyte-like cells derived from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. In vivo, HEV RNA levels rapidly declined in the feces of treated mice while no effect was observed in the vehicle treated control animals. In conclusion, silvestrol could be identified as pangenotypic HEV replication inhibitor in vitro with additive effect to RBV and further demonstrated high potency in vivo. The compound therefore may be considered in future treatment strategies of chronic hepatitis E in immunocompromised patients.","publish_time":"2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Todt, Daniel; Moeller, Nora; Praditya, Dimas; Kinast, Volker; Friesland, Martina; Engelmann, Michael; Verhoye, Lieven; Sayed, Ibrahim M.; Behrendt, Patrick; Dao Thi, Viet Loan; Meuleman, Philip; Steinmann, Eike","journal":"Antiviral Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/962fe9022b7ecbb15c50380673d47716888060d4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4c528c7489bb789fc67e760eac30268fba28270d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036559/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217308550; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.07.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217308550","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HEV infections","HEV p6","HEV RNA levels","pangenotypic HEV replication inhibitor","HEV infection experiments of hepatocyte","Silvestrol blocked HEV replication of different subgenomic replicons","Hepatitis E virus","natural compound silvestrol","state-of-the-art HEV experimental model systems","additive effect","pangenotypic effect","presence of silvestrol","causative agent of hepatitis E","future treatment strategies of chronic hepatitis E","length replication","RBV","immunocompromised patients","Ribavirin","common cause of acute hepatitis","different human genotypes","infected transplantation patients","acted additive","specific treatments","specific inhibition","chronic courses","treatment of choice","pluripotent stem cells","feces of treated mice","DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A","low nanomolar concentrations","dose-dependent manner","humans","member","primary isolates","production of infectious particles","genus Orthohepevirus","plant Aglaia foveolata","family Hepeviridae","vehicle","high potency","control animals","interferon","IFN","study","addition","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been at the forefront of treatment for cancer and a wide array of other diseases due to their specificity and potency. While mammalian cell-produced mAbs have shown promise as therapeutic candidates against several flaviviruses, their eventual approval for human application still faces several challenges including their potential risk of predisposing treated patients to more severe secondary infection by a heterologous flavivirus through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The high cost associated with mAb production in mammalian cell cultures also poses a challenge for the feasible application of these drugs to the developing world where the majority of flavivirus infection occurs. Here, we review the current therapeutic mAb candidates against various flaviviruses including West Nile (WNV), Dengue virus (DENV), and ZIKV. The progress of using plants for developing safer and more economical mAb therapeutics against flaviviruses is discussed within the context of their expression, characterization, downstream processing, neutralization, and in vivo efficacy. The progress of using plant glycoengineering to address ADE, the major impediment of flavivirus therapeutic development, is highlighted. These advancements suggest that plant-based systems are excellent alternatives for addressing the remaining challenges of mAb therapeutic development against flavivirus and may facilitate the eventual commercialization of these drug candidates.","publish_time":"2017-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Haiyan; Chen, Qiang; Lai, Huafang","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bfb99375e4f9ba5e47e0bc752b2b5fc4cdb1c30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5796004.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29295568/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19010054","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapeutic candidates","current therapeutic mAb candidates","mAb production","remaining challenges of mAb therapeutic development","heterologous flavivirus","various flaviviruses","major impediment of flavivirus therapeutic development","majority of flavivirus infection","economical mAb therapeutics","drug candidates","ZIKV","ADE","developing world","progress","mammalian cell cultures","Dengue virus","human application","eventual approval","eventual commercialization","plant glycoengineering","feasible application","severe secondary infection","plant-based systems","Recent outbreaks of Zika virus","WNV","West Nile","potential risk of predisposing treated patients","excellent alternatives","antibody-dependent enhancement","characterization","urgent need","downstream processing","diseases","cancer","wide array","neutralization","expression","efficacious interventions","DENV","drugs","mAbs","forefront of treatment","high cost","plants","advancements","context","devastating epidemics","specificity","potency","efficacy","Monoclonal antibodies"],"language":"en"},

Porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) is a newly discovered receptor for F4 fimbriae that binds directly to FaeG adhesin, which is the major subunit of the F4 fimbriae variants F4ab, F4ac, and F4ad. We used overlapping peptide assays to map the APN-FaeG binding sites, which has facilitated in the identifying the APN-binding amino acids that are located in the same region of FaeG variants, thereby limiting the major binding regions of APN to 13 peptides. To determine the core sequence motif, a panel of FaeG peptides with point mutations and FaeG mutants were constructed. Pull-down and binding reactivity assays using piglet intestines determined that the amino acids G159 of F4ab, N209 and L212 of F4ac, and A200 of F4ad were the critical residues for APN binding of FaeG.

The evidence for an association between MG and influenza transmission is reviewed to assess whether restricting MG may reduce transmission. Methods Major databases were searched (Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL), producing 1706 articles that were sifted by title, abstract, and full-text. A narrative approach was adopted for data synthesis. Results Twenty-four papers met the inclusion criteria, covering MG of varying sizes and settings, and including 9 observational studies, 10 outbreak reports, 4 event reports, and a quasi-experimental study. There is some evidence that certain types of MG may be associated with increased risk of influenza transmission. MG may also \u201Cseed\u201D new strains into an area, and may instigate community transmission in a pandemic. Restricting MGs, in combination with other social distancing interventions, may help reduce transmission, but it was not possible to identify conclusive evidence on the individual effect of MG restriction alone. Evidence suggests that event duration and crowdedness may be the key factors that determine the risk of influenza transmission, and possibly the type of venue (indoor/outdoor). Conclusion These factors potentially represent a basis for a policy-making framework for MG restrictions in the event of a severe pandemic.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ishola, David A.; Phin, Nick","journal":"Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b82f68e399d847ad6046fa8ccc13586ab2ed7b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104184.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210600611000062; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210600611000062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23856374/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jegh.2011.06.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["community transmission","increased risk of influenza transmission","event reports","conclusive evidence","event duration","outbreak reports","key factors","severe pandemic","Abstract Introduction Mass gatherings","Pubmed","area","crowdedness","inclusion criteria","CINAHL","combination","settings","EMBASE","basis","observational studies","restrictions","framework","social distancing interventions","individual effect","type of venue","quasi-experimental study","varying sizes","Methods Major databases","ideal conditions","narrative approach","data synthesis","seed","new strains","Results","papers","policy","Scopus","association","articles","MGs","title","Conclusion","certain types","text"],"language":"en"},

Background Little is known about the prevalence of viral infections in children with community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP). Objectives To describe the clinical and virological data collected from children with radiographically confirmed CAP in whom 17 respiratory viruses were sought in respiratory secretion samples during the acute phase of the disease. Patients and methods The study involved 592 children with radiographically confirmed CAP whose respiratory secretion samples were tested using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel Fast assay, which simultaneously detects influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\u2010A and \u2010B, parainfluenzavirus\u20101, \u20102, \u20103, and \u20104, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and bocavirus. A real\u2010time PCR assay was used to identify the rhinovirus in the enterovirus/rhinovirus\u2010positive samples. Results A total of 435 children (73\u00B75%) were positive for at least one virus: the most frequently detected was RSV, which was found in 188 (31\u00B77%), followed by rhinovirus (n = 144, 24\u00B73%), bocavirus (n = 60, 10\u00B71%), influenza viruses (n = 57, 9\u00B76), and hMPV (n = 49, 8\u00B72%). Viral co\u2010infections were found in 117 children (19\u00B77% of the enrolled children; 26\u00B79% of those with viral infections). Marginal differences were found between the infections owing to a single virus. Co\u2010infections showed radiographic evidence of alveolar pneumonia significantly more frequently than single infections (OR 1\u00B772, 95% CI 1\u00B705\u20132\u00B781). Conclusions The findings of this study highlight the importance of respiratory viruses (mainly RSV and rhinovirus) in children with CAP and show the characteristics of both the single infections and co\u2010infections associated with the disease.","publish_time":"2012-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, Susanna; Daleno, Cristina; Prunotto, Giulia; Scala, Alessia; Tagliabue, Claudia; Borzani, Irene; Fossali, Emilio; Pelucchi, Claudio; Principi, Nicola","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/885ca5f85c120048c30b3f74bd2a6ddf9b79736f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780730.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00340.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22329841/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single infections","Viral co\u2010infections","respiratory syncytial virus","rhinovirus","importance of respiratory viruses","Respiratory Viruses DOI","prevalence of viral infections","Impact of viral infections","single virus","influenza viruses","enrolled children","respiratory secretion samples","influenza B virus","study","confirmed CAP","RSV","Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel Fast assay","positive samples","community","enterovirus","disease","results","bocavirus","radiographic evidence of alveolar pneumonia","real\u2010time PCR assay","coronaviruses","NL63","OC43","acute phase","human metapneumovirus","virological data","HKU1","characteristics","adenovirus","findings","methods","Esposito","Objectives","Conclusions","Patients","Marginal differences","hMPV","CI","paper","Background","parainfluenzavirus","total"],"language":"en"},

We have previously reported that antibodies elicited by a SARS-CoV vaccine candidate based on recombinant, full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers, trigger infection of immune cell lines. These observations prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanisms and responses to antibody-mediated infection in human macrophages. METHODS: We have used primary human immune cells to evaluate their susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV in the presence of anti-Spike antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to assess occurrence and consequences of infection. To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed mutational analysis with a series of truncated and chimeric constructs of fragment crystallizable \u03B3 receptors (Fc\u03B3R), which bind antibody-coated pathogens. RESULTS: We show here that anti-Spike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp). Macrophages infected with SARS-CoV, however, did not support productive replication of the virus. Purified anti-viral IgGs, but not other soluble factor(s) from heat-inactivated mouse immune serum, were sufficient to enhance infection. Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on signaling-competent members of the human Fc\u03B3RII family, which were shown to confer susceptibility to otherwise na\u00EFve ST486 cells, as binding of immune complexes to cell surface Fc\u03B3RII was necessary but not sufficient to trigger antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Furthermore, only Fc\u03B3RII with intact cytoplasmic signaling domains were competent to sustain ADE of SARS-CoVpp infection, thus providing additional information on the role of downstream signaling by Fc\u03B3RII. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that human macrophages can be infected by SARS-CoV as a result of IgG-mediated ADE and indicate that this infection route requires signaling pathways activated downstream of binding to Fc\u03B3RII receptors.","publish_time":"2014-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yip, Ming Shum; Leung, Nancy Hiu Lan; Cheung, Chung Yan; Li, Ping Hung; Lee, Horace Hok Yeung; Da\u00EBron, Marc; Peiris, Joseph Sriyal Malik; Bruzzone, Roberto; Jaume, Martial","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4930fc9d9e3cb5bea0a97320187aca766f07493d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4018502.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-11-82; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885320/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoVpp infection","ADE of SARS","antibody-mediated infection","infection route","consequences of infection","SARS-CoVpp","replication-competent SARS-CoV","human macrophages","SARS-CoV vaccine candidate","trigger infection of immune cell lines","human Fc\u03B3RII family","full-length SARS-CoV Spike-protein trimers","anti-Spike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages","primary human immune cells","human coronaviruses","Fc\u03B3RII receptors","mediated ADE","binding of immune complexes","cell surface Fc\u03B3RII","presence of anti-Spike antibodies","antibody-dependent enhancement","heat-inactivated mouse immune serum","competent members","susceptibility","antibody-coated pathogens","RESULTS","Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles","molecular mechanisms","productive replication","na\u00EFve ST486 cells","underlying molecular mechanism","chimeric constructs of fragment crystallizable \u03B3 receptors","real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","recombinant","series of truncated","RT-PCR","Fluorescence microscopy","mutational analysis","vaccination","Public health risks","domains","responses","key option","result of IgG","additional information","pathways","soluble factor","BACKGROUND","insight","role","occurrence","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","observations"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective epidemiological approach was used where data was obtained from the department of pathology registry files and pathology reports. The records of all patients registered from January 2005 to December 2014 with a diagnosis of primary CNS tumor (brain and spinal cord) were selected. Data about sex, age, tumor location, and histologic type were collected. The classification was based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3). RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety-two (992) cases of primary CNS tumors throughout the ten years (2005 to 2014) were reviewed. There were 714 (71.97%) adults and 278 (28.02%) in the pediatric age group. Nonmalignant tumors dominated the adult population (60.08%) while malignant tumors were more frequent in the pediatric population. Gliomas constituted the most common neoplastic category in children and adults. The most common single tumor entity was meningioma (26.99%, ICD-O-3 histology codes 9530/0, 9539/1, and 9530/3). Medulloblastomas (ICD-O-3 histology codes 9470, 9471, and 9474) were the most common single tumor entity in the pediatric age group (26.62%). CONCLUSIONS: This is an institution-based, detailed, and descriptive epidemiological study of patients with primary CNS tumors in Saudi Arabia. In contrast to other regional and international studies, the medulloblastomas in our institution are more frequent than pilocytic astrocytomas. Limitations to our study included the referral bias and histology-based methodology.","publish_time":"2020-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almutrafi, Amna; Bashawry, Yara; AlShakweer, Wafaa; Al-Harbi, Musa; Altwairgi, Abdullah; Al-Dandan, Sadeq","journal":"J Cancer Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db162ca7c3474f8458b25876670790493e18f920.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7044490.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32256589/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1429615","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","National Neurologic Institute"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["cases of primary CNS tumors","epidemiological trends of primary CNS tumors","diagnosis of primary CNS tumor","Nonmalignant tumors","adults","ICD-O","common single tumor entity","pediatric age group","tumor location","pediatric population","histology codes","histology-based methodology","descriptive epidemiological study of patients","children","Saudi Arabia","data","Medulloblastomas","institution","common neoplastic category","retrospective epidemiological approach","International Classification of Diseases","pathology reports","international studies","adult population","department of pathology registry files","brain","National Neurologic Institute","referral bias","Oncology","meningioma","spinal cord","Edition","sex","histologic type","contrast","METHODS","Gliomas","pilocytic astrocytomas","years","Limitations","CONCLUSIONS","records","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Human bocavirus was detected using the respiratory virus panel fast assay and real-time PCR. Of the 1,823 nasopharyngeal samples, 104 (5.7%) were positive for hBoV; a similar prevalence was observed in all three periods studied. Among hBoV-infected children, 53.8% were between 1\u20132 years old, and hBoV was detected alone in 57/104 (54.8%) cases. All of the detected hBoV strains belonged to genotype 1. The median hBoV load was significantly higher in samples containing strains with both the N546H and T590S mutations compared to other samples (p\u003C0.05). Children with a single hBoV-1 infection more frequently had upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) than those who were co-infected (37.0% vs 17.8%, respectively, p = 0.04). The duration of hospitalization was longer among children with high viral loads than that observed among children with low viral loads (8.0 \u00B12.2 days vs 5.0 \u00B11.5 days, respectively, p = 0.03), and the use of aerosol therapy was more frequent among children with high viral loads than among those with low viral loads (77.1% vs 55.7%, respectively, p = 0.04). This study shows that hBoV is a relatively uncommon but stable infectious agent in children and that hBoV1 seems to be the only strain detected in Italy in respiratory samples. From a clinical point of view, hBoV1 seems to have in the majority of healthy children relatively low clinical relevance. Moreover, the viral load influences only the duration of hospitalization and the use of aerosol therapy without any association with the site of the respiratory disease.","publish_time":"2015-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Principi, Nicola; Piralla, Antonio; Zampiero, Alberto; Bianchini, Sonia; Umbrello, Giulia; Scala, Alessia; Bosis, Samantha; Fossali, Emilio; Baldanti, Fausto; Esposito, Susanna","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e88ddb14ceee73a1db00d2991c683b872e747b33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4534143.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26267139/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hBoV-infected children","respiratory samples","single hBoV","detected hBoV strains","hBoV-positive nasopharyngeal samples","median hBoV load","low viral loads","high viral loads","different hBoV species","respiratory disease type","majority of healthy children","viral load influences","causative agent of respiratory disease","upper respiratory tract infections","days vs","respiratory virus panel fast assay","use of aerosol therapy","low clinical relevance","hBoV1","duration of hospitalization","role of human bocavirus","stable infectious agent","clinical point of view","pathogenicity","severity","importance","real-time PCR","URTIs","association","emergency room","N546H","T590S mutations","site","similar prevalence","winters","Italy","genotype","years old","periods","study","cases"],"language":"en"},

Very recently, we have demonstrated the indispensability of ORF1 protease-domain cysteines and histidines in HEV replication, ex vivo (Parvez, 2013). In this report, the polyprotein partial sequences of HEV strains and genetically-related RNA viruses were analyzed, in silico. Employing the consensus-prediction results of RUBV-p150 protease as structural-template, a 3D model of HEV-protease was deduced. Similar to RUBV-p150, a \u2018papain-like \u03B2-barrel fold\u2019 structurally confirmed the classification of HEV-protease. Further, we recognized a catalytic \u2018Cys434-His443\u2019 dyad homologue of RUBV-p150 (Cys1152-His1273) and FMDV-Lpro (Cys51-His148) in line with our previous mutational analysis that showed essentiality of \u2018His443\u2019 but not \u2018His590\u2019 in HEV viability. Moreover, a RUBV \u2018Zn2\u002B binding motif\u2019 (Cys1167-Cys1175-Cys1178-Cys1225-Cys1227) equivalent of HEV was identified as \u2018Cys457-His458-Cys459 and Cys481-Cys483\u2019 residues within the \u2018\u03B2-barrel fold\u2019. Notably, unlike RUBV, \u2018His458\u2019 also clustered therein, that was in conformity with the consensus cysteine protease \u2018Zn2\u002B-binding motif\u2019. By homology, we also proposed an overlapping \u2018Ca2\u002B-binding site\u2019 \u2018D-X-[DNS]-[ILVFYW]-[DEN]-G-[GP]-XX-DE\u2019 signature, and a \u2018proline-rich motif\u2019 interacting \u2018tryptophan (W437-W472)\u2019 module in the modeled structure. Our analysis of the predicted model therefore, warrants critical roles of the \u2018catalytic dyad\u2019 and \u2018divalent metal-binding motifs\u2019 in HEV protease structural-integrity, ORF1 self-processing, and RNA replication. This however, needs further experimental validations.","publish_time":"2014-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parvez, Mohammad Khalid; Khan, Azmat Ali","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b5c406e95bdc2cd2dd35261b0737152cb7534c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114377.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24321124/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213004231; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213004231; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p150 protease","HEV replication","HEV protease structural-integrity","equivalent of HEV","classification of HEV","HEV viability","D model of HEV","RUBV-p150","consensus cysteine protease","HEV ORF1-encoded polyprotein","dyad homologue of RUBV","indispensability of ORF1 protease-domain cysteines","polyprotein partial sequences of HEV strains","binding site","consensus-prediction results of RUBV","papain","catalytic dyad","RNA replication","Zn2","\u03B2-barrel fold","divalent metal-binding motifs\u2019","ORF1 self-processing","proline-rich motif","structural-template","D-X","Cys434-His443","predicted model","Cys457-His458","related RNA viruses","previous mutational analysis","histidines","Cys1167-Cys1175","Cys1178-Cys1225","Cys459","Cys481-Cys483","residues","Cys1227","critical roles","Cys1152-His1273","Cys51-His148","FMDV-Lpro","module","W437-W472","tryptophan","overlapping","essentiality","biophysical characterization","DEN","DNS","report","Ca2","His590","Parvez","conformity","modeled structure","GP","ILVFYW","silico","experimental validations","signature","homology"],"language":"en"},

The repositioning process involves lower risks and costs than the de novo development of novel antimicrobial drugs. Currently, infections by adenovirus show a steady increment with a high clinical impact in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients. The lack of a safe and efficacious drug to treat these infections supports the search for new antiviral drugs. Here we evaluated the anti-adenovirus activity of niclosanide, oxyclozanide, and rafoxanide, three salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs. Also, we carried out the cytotoxicity evaluation and partial characterization of the mechanism of action of these drugs. The salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs showed significant anti-adenovirus activity at low micromolar concentrations with little cytotoxicity. Moreover, our mechanistic assays suggest differences in the way the drugs exert anti-adenovirus activity. Niclosamide and rafoxanide target transport of the HAdV particle from the endosome to the nuclear envelope, whilst oxyclozanide specifically targets adenovirus immediately early gene E1A transcription. Data suggests that the studied salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs could be suitable for further clinical evaluation for the development of new antiviral drugs to treat infections by adenovirus in immunosuppressed patients and in immunocompetent individuals with community-acquired pneumonia.","publish_time":"2019-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marrugal-Lorenzo, Jos\u00E9 A.; Serna-Gallego, Ana; Berastegui-Cabrera, Judith; Pach\u00F3n, Jer\u00F3nimo; S\u00E1nchez-C\u00E9spedes, Javier","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51340894a896316b58653a60c48da9c16b3ad0e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6327057.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626902/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37290-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["repositioning of drugs","development of new antiviral drugs","studied salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs","significant anti-adenovirus activity","anti-adenovirus activity of niclosanide","novo development of novel antimicrobial drugs","infections","development of new antimicrobial therapies","oxyclozanide","clinical evaluation","immunocompetent patients","immunosuppressed patients","cytotoxicity evaluation","immunocompetent individuals","little cytotoxicity","repositioning process","high clinical impact","rafoxanide target transport","low micromolar concentrations","way","costs","steady increment","HAdV particle","partial characterization","emerging alternative","lower risks","early gene E1A transcription","mechanism of action","endosome","indications","efficacious drug","community","nuclear envelope","differences","regulatory agencies","search","lack","mechanistic assays","Niclosamide","pneumonia","Data"],"language":"en"},

Acute viral pharyngitis may be easily misdiagnosed as acute bacterial pharyngitis. Laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of respiratory viruses is recommended. The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivities among oropharyngeal swab (OPS), nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), and nasal wash (NW) in adults with acute pharyngitis. METHODS: OPS, NPS, and NW were obtained from each participant with acute pharyngitis. The specimens were tested for 15 respiratory viruses by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. A sample was considered to be a true positive if any of the specimens was positive. The sensitivities among samples were compared by chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. RESULTS: One hundred three triple samples collected consecutively by OPS, NPS, and NW were obtained. In 73 patients, one or more viruses were detected by any of the three methods. Among all viruses, the sensitivity of NPS was significantly higher than that of NW (74% vs. 49%, respectively; p \u003C 0.01) and OPS (74% vs. 49%, respectively; p \u003C 0.01).

Targeted microbial binding to host glycans has also been studied for decades. But such biological roles can only explain some of the remarkable complexity and organismal diversity of glycans in nature. Reviewing the subject about two decades ago, one could find very few clear-cut instances of glycan-recognition-specific biological roles of glycans that were of intrinsic value to the organism expressing them. In striking contrast there is now a profusion of examples, such that this updated review cannot be comprehensive. Instead, a historical overview is presented, broad principles outlined and a few examples cited, representing diverse types of roles, mediated by various glycan classes, in different evolutionary lineages. What remains unchanged is the fact that while all theories regarding biological roles of glycans are supported by compelling evidence, exceptions to each can be found. In retrospect, this is not surprising. Complex and diverse glycans appear to be ubiquitous to all cells in nature, and essential to all life forms. Thus, \u003E3 billion years of evolution consistently generated organisms that use these molecules for many key biological roles, even while sometimes coopting them for minor functions. In this respect, glycans are no different from other major macromolecular building blocks of life (nucleic acids, proteins and lipids), simply more rapidly evolving and complex. It is time for the diverse functional roles of glycans to be fully incorporated into the mainstream of biological sciences.","publish_time":"2016-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Varki, Ajit","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a086d735d850c607720d4b334d0a5de3630a904.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5884436.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/glycob/article-pdf/27/1/3/24324377/cww086.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cww086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27558841/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diverse glycans","diverse functional roles of glycans","key biological roles","recognition-specific biological roles of glycans","host glycans","physical roles","diverse types of roles","biological systems","organismal diversity of glycans","mainstream of biological sciences","nature","complex carbohydrates","decades","life forms","profusion of examples","major macromolecular building blocks of life","various glycan classes","different evolutionary lineages","clear-cut instances of glycan","nucleic acids","broad principles","proteins","Targeted microbial binding","remarkable complexity","molecules","theories","compelling evidence","intrinsic value","organisms","historical overview","lipids","updated review","cells","fact","time","years of evolution","striking contrast","exceptions","respect","retrospect","minor functions","subject"],"language":"en"},

This is due to both mortality (either directly provoked by IBV itself or due to subsequent bacterial infection) and lost egg production. The virus is difficult to control by vaccination, so new methods to curb the impact of the disease need to be sought. Here, we seek to identify genes conferring resistance to this coronavirus, which could help in selective breeding programs to rear chickens which do not succumb to the effects of this disease. METHODS: Whole genome gene expression microarrays were used to analyse the gene expression differences, which occur upon infection of birds with Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV). Tracheal tissue was examined from control and infected birds at 2, 3 and 4 days post-infection in birds known to be either susceptible or resistant to the virus. The host innate immune response was evaluated over these 3 days and differences between the susceptible and resistant lines examined. RESULTS: Genes and biological pathways involved in the early host response to IBV infection were determined andgene expression differences between susceptible and resistant birds were identified. Potential candidate genes for resistance to IBV are highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: The early host response to IBV is analysed and potential candidate genes for disease resistance are identified. These putative resistance genes can be used as targets for future genetic and functional studies to prove a causative link with resistance to IBV.

Approximately 40% of primary RSV infections in children result in lower respiratory tract disease. Approximately 1% of RSV-infected children require hospitalization. Especially in high-risk children, primary RSV infection results in significant morbidity and, sometimes, death. This high-risk group includes children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, children with congenital heart disease, premature infants less than 6 months of age, and children with immunodeficiency diseases. It has been estimated that, in the United States, 14,000 infants with chronic lung disease and 16,400 infants with heart disease will be identified by 12 months of age. More than 91,000 children are hospitalized annually with lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV, and 4500 deaths occur. In 1985 a report from the Institute of Medicine calculated that the annual hospitalization costs attributable to RSV infection were $300 million. Data collected at the New England Medical Center in 1991 show that the average cost of hospitalization of a child with RSV was $808 each day. Because of difficulty in developing a safe and effective RSV vaccine, attention is now focused on passive immunization using an RSV immune globulin. On the basis of a recently completed multiinstitutional trial, RSV immune globulin appears to be a safe and cost-effective option for prevention of severe RSV disease in high-risk children.

Inactivated influenza vaccines are ineffective in infants under six months and to provide protection in older children generally require two doses given a month apart. This leaves few options for rapid protection of infants, e.g. during an influenza pandemic. We investigated whether Advax\u2122, a novel polysaccharide adjuvant based on delta inulin microparticles could help overcome neonatal immune hypo-responsiveness and also whether it was possible to obtain single-dose influenza vaccine protection of babies against lethal infection. Inactivated influenza A/H1N1 vaccine (iH1N1) combined with Advax\u2122 adjuvant administered as a single immunization to 7-day-old mouse pups significantly enhanced serum influenza-specific IgM, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b levels in association with a 3\u20134 fold increase in the frequency of splenic influenza-specific IgM and IgG antibody secreting cells versus pups immunized with iH1N1 alone. Pups immunized with Advax-adjuvanted iH1N1 had significantly higher influenza-stimulated splenocyte production of IFN-\u03B3, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 and a 3\u201310 fold higher frequency of T cells IFN-\u03B3 secreting IL-2, IL-4 or IL-17 by ELISPOT. Immunisation with iH1N1\u002BAdvax adjuvant induced robust protection against influenza virus challenge 3 weeks post-immunization, whereas pups immunized with iH1N1 alone had no protection. Protection by Advax-adjuvanted iH1N1 was mediated by serum antibody and memory B cells rather than memory T cells as protection was lost in neonatal \u00B5MT mice that are B-cell deficient. Hence, Advax adjuvant overcame neonatal immune hypo-responsiveness and enabled single-dose protection of pups against otherwise lethal influenza infection, thereby supporting development of Advax\u2122 as a neonatal vaccine adjuvant.","publish_time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Honda-Okubo, Yoshikazu; Ong, Chun Hao; Petrovsky, Nikolai","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96087de237f212abb07044bfee6b357c7376083c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5508595d00d43f6c09b931623d80253121c410c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4562881.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.07.051; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4562881?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15010129; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X15010129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26232344/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ELISPOT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Advax adjuvant","influenza morbidity","influenza pandemic","Advax-adjuvanted iH1N1","lethal influenza infection","single-dose influenza vaccine protection of babies","robust protection","Inactivated influenza vaccines","influenza virus challenge","neonatal vaccine adjuvant","development of Advax","enabled single-dose protection of pups","rapid protection of infants","enhanced serum influenza-specific IgM","frequency of splenic influenza-specific IgM","higher influenza-stimulated splenocyte production of IFN","neonatal immune hypo-responsiveness","memory T cells","memory B cells","fold higher frequency of T cells IFN-\u03B3 secreting IL","single immunization","day-old mouse pups","novel polysaccharide adjuvant","IgG antibody secreting cells","serum antibody","immune immaturity","neonatal \u00B5MT mice","lethal infection","H1N1 vaccine","fold increase","weeks post-immunization","B-cell deficient","mortality","IgG1","delta inulin microparticles","IgG2a","lack of priming","high risk","IgG2b levels","association","months","prior exposure","older children","doses","Neonates","options","Immunisation","ELISPOT"],"language":"en"},

In particular, polymorphisms of the human IFITM3 gene have been shown to affect disease severity and progression in influenza A virus (FLUAV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, respectively. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are commonly used to model human infections and the experimental inoculation of these animals with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is one of the best models for HIV/AIDS in humans. However, information on the role of IFITM3 in SIV infection of rhesus macaques is currently lacking. We show that rhesus macaque (rh) IFITM3 inhibits SIV and FLUAV entry in cell culture, although with moderately reduced efficiency as compared to its human counterpart. We further report the identification of 16 polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3 gene, three of which were exonic and synonymous while the remainder was located in non-coding regions. Employing previously characterized samples from two cohorts of SIV-infected rhesus macaques, we investigated the relationship between these rhIFITM3 polymorphisms and both AIDS-free survival time and virus load. In cohort 1, several intronic polymorphisms were significantly associated with virus load or survival. However, an association with both parameters was not observed and significance was lost in most cases when animals were stratified for the presence of MHC allele Mamu-A1*001. Moreover, no significant genotype-phenotype associations were detected in cohort 2. These results suggest that, although IFITM3 can inhibit SIV infection in cell culture, genetic variation in rhIFITM3 might have only a minor impact on the course of SIV infection in experimentally infected animals.","publish_time":"2017-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Winkler, Michael; G\u00E4rtner, Sabine; Wrensch, Florian; Krawczak, Michael; Sauermann, Ulrike; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c16d19032f42486b997727ee0f732ab9fd5b9a84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5336200.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28257482/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS","SIV","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIV infection of rhesus macaques","course of SIV infection","human immunodeficiency virus","cohorts of SIV","virus load","rhIFITM3 polymorphisms","human IFITM3 gene","infected rhesus macaques","cell culture","infected animals","simian immunodeficiency virus","role of IFITM3","rhIFITM3 gene","human infections","intronic polymorphisms","human counterpart","infected humans","HIV","FLUAV entry","AIDS-free survival time","innate immune system","experimental inoculation","genetic variation","remainder","important antiviral effectors","progression","influenza","minor impact","presence of MHC allele Mamu-A1","IFITMs","disease severity","best models","reduced efficiency","relationship","significant genotype-phenotype associations","Interferon","transmembrane proteins","non-coding regions","exonic","characterized samples","Macaca mulatta","parameters","significance","cases","information","identification","results"],"language":"en"},

Our aim was to study the effects of wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) and the restriction in the number of resuscitation personnel on airway management during the SARS crisis. Data was collected prospectively through an ongoing emergency airway registry. The data was divided into three periods: (1) before PPE was instituted from 1 November 2002 to 31 March 2003; (2) during SARS (when PPE use was mandatory) from 1 April to 31 July 2003; (3) post-SARs (when PPE use was non-mandatory but encouraged) from 1 August to 31 March 2004. There was no change in patient demographics during the three periods. There were significant increases in the proportion of resuscitation cases and airway interventions during the SARS period compared to the pre-SARS period. The resident medical officer intubation rate decreased from 45.1% pre-SARS to 35.2% during SARS and 17.7% post-SARS.

We conduct the first comparative host\u2013pathogen coevolutionary analyses of bacterial pathogens in these hosts, using Bartonella spp. and Leptospira spp. as a model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used published genetic data for 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. We generated maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria, and tested for coevoutionary congruence using programs ParaFit, PACO, and Jane. Bartonella spp. and their bat hosts had a significant coevolutionary fit (ParaFitGlobal = 1.9703, P\u22640.001; m(2) global value = 7.3320, P\u22640.0001). Bartonella spp. and rodent hosts also indicated strong overall patterns of cospeciation (ParaFitGlobal = 102.4409, P\u22640.001; m(2) global value = 86.532, P\u22640.0001). In contrast, we were unable to reject independence of speciation events in Leptospira and bats (ParaFitGlobal = 0.0042, P = 0.84; m(2) global value = 4.6310, P = 0.5629). Separate analyses of New World and Old World data subsets yielded results congruent with analysis from entire datasets. We also conducted event-based cophylogeny analyses to reconstruct likely evolutionary histories for each group of pathogens and hosts. Leptospira and bats had the greatest number of host switches per parasite (0.731), while Bartonella and rodents had the fewest (0.264). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In both bat and rodent hosts, Bartonella exhibits significant coevolution with minimal host switching, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has high number of host switches. Reasons underlying these variable coevolutionary patterns in host range are likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology. Understanding the coevolutionary patterns and frequency of host-switching events between bacterial pathogens and their hosts will allow better prediction of spillover between mammal reservoirs, and ultimately to humans.","publish_time":"2014-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Bonnie R.; Olival, Kevin J.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/638c36249e56a71ae71edd5391b1ca7fafd82daf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3961187.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651646/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002738","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leptospira"],"organizations":["Bartonella"],"locations":["New World"],"keyphrases":["bat hosts","bats","Leptospira","host range","minimal host","host ecology","comparative host","frequency of host","rodent hosts","Bartonella genotypes","greatest number of host switches","high number of host switches","ParaFitGlobal","rodents","global value","pathogen coevolutionary analyses of bacterial pathogens","variable coevolutionary patterns","significant coevolutionary fit","evolutionary congruence","group of pathogens","bat species","Separate analyses of New World","likely evolutionary histories","Emerging bacterial zoonoses","Old World data subsets","event-based cophylogeny analyses","strong overall patterns of cospeciation","coevoutionary congruence","published genetic data","independence of speciation events","results congruent","analysis","differences","disease-specific transmission","better prediction of spillover","mammal reservoirs","programs ParaFit","PACO","Bayesian phylogenies","parasite","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","entire datasets","maximum likelihood","BACKGROUND","Jane","SIGNIFICANCE","Reasons","METHODOLOGY","humans","CONCLUSIONS","contrast","model"],"language":"en"},

Influenza A virus, hepatitis C virus, and several other pathogenic viruses are mainly recognized by RIG-I, resulting in the activation of the innate immune responses. The protein comprises N-terminal two caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARDs), an RNA helicase domain, and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD recognizes 5\u2032-triphosphate viral dsRNA. After recognition of viral dsRNA, the protein harbors K63-linked polyubiquitination essential for RIG-I activation. First, it was reported that TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase delivered K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety to the 2CARDs. The polyubiquitin chain stabilizes a structure called the 2CARD tetramer, in which four 2CARDs assemble and make a core that promotes the aggregation of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS) protein on mitochondria. MAVS aggregation then triggers the signal to induce the innate immune responses. However, subsequent studies have reported that Riplet, MEX3C, and TRIM4 ubiquitin ligases are also involved in K63-linked polyubiquitination and the activation of RIG-I. MEX3C and TRIM4 mediate polyubiquitination of the 2CARDs. By contrast, Riplet ubiquitinates the CTD. The physiological significance of each ubiquitin ligases has been shown by knockout and knockdown studies, but there appears to be contradictory to evidence reported in the literature. In this review, we summarize recent findings related to K63-linked polyubiquitination and propose a model that could reconcile current contradictory theories. We also discuss the physiological significance of the ubiquitin ligases in the immune system against viral infection.","publish_time":"2018-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Okamoto, Masaaki; Kouwaki, Takahisa; Fukushima, Yoshimi; Oshiumi, Hiroyuki","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bd9e38537d45c72b8507471690027a78f8f4584.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5760545.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29354136/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01942","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activation of RIG","CARDs","TRIM4 ubiquitin ligases","recognition of viral dsRNA","CTD","protein harbors K63-linked polyubiquitination essential","K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety","triphosphate viral dsRNA","viral infection","caspase activation","innate immune responses","C-terminal domain","TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase","MEX3C","immune system","physiological significance","MAVS aggregation","cytoplasmic viral double-stranded RNA","hepatitis C virus","RNA helicase domain","N-terminal","Riplet ubiquitinates","polyubiquitin chain","knockdown studies","subsequent studies","pattern recognition receptor","current contradictory theories","model","recruitment domains","signal","recent findings","structure","Influenza","knockout","mitochondrial antiviral","pathogenic viruses","contrast","CARD tetramer","review","evidence","literature","core"],"language":"en"},

Methods In a prospective study, patients from two states in Australia attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) throat and nasal swabs (SCNT) prior to health worker collect (HC) using throat and nasal swabs (Site 1) or throat and nasopharyngeal swabs (Site 2). Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohen\u0027s kappa (\u03BA) and Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for all positive results as a surrogate measure for viral load. Results Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had SARS-CoV-2 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 y SC). SC was highly concordant with HC (\u03BA = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method (\u03BA = 0.959 vs 0.933). Mean SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and N-gene, rhinovirus and parainfluenza Ct values did not differ between HC and SCNT. Conclusions Self-collection of throat and nasal swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces exposure of the community and health workers to those being tested and reduces requirement for PPE.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wehrhahn, Michael C.; Robson, Jennifer; Brown, Suzanne; Bursle, Evan; Byrne, Shane; New, David; Chong, Smathi; Newcombe, James P.; Siversten, Terri; Hadlow, Narelle","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b87dbd95aab711d9a65a7f02e870f76cc50e344.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198188.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403007/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301591?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301591; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104417","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cohen"],"organizations":["PPE","HC","SC","SCNT"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["HC","Mean SARS-CoV","diagnosis of SARS","nasal swabs","health worker collection","common respiratory viruses","Conclusions Self-collection of throat","patients","health workers","positive results","y SC","reliability of self-collection","nasopharyngeal swabs","collection clinics","Concordance of results","Site","Methods","SCNT","PPE","parainfluenza Ct values","E-gene","N-gene","reliable alternative","states","exposure","rhinovirus","Cycle threshold","easier access","use of personal protective equipment","testing","dedicated COVID","surrogate measure","risk of infection","Cohen\u0027s kappa","Australia","option","swab collections","prospective study","community","viral load","Abstract Objectives","vs","Samples","requirement"],"language":"en"},

Turkeys were vaccinated by priming with either one dose (G1-750DP) or two doses (G3-750DDP) of 750\u03BCg DNA vaccine expressing 4F/4R S fragment and boosting with one dose of 200\u03BCg 4F/4R S fragment. One dose of 100\u03BCg DNA vaccine mixed with polyethyleneimine (PEI) and sodium hyaluronate (HA) followed by one dose of 750\u03BCg DNA vaccine and one dose of 200\u03BCg 4F/4R S fragment were given to the turkeys in group G2-100DPH. After infectious challenge by TCoV, clinical signs and TCoV detected by immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay were observed in less number of turkeys in vaccination groups than that in challenge control groups. TCoV viral RNA loads measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR were lower in vaccinated turkeys than those in challenge control turkeys. The turkeys in G3-750DDP produced the highest level of TCoV S protein-specific antibody and virus neutralization (VN) titer. Comparing to the turkeys in G1-750DP, significantly less TCoV were detected by IFA in the turkeys in G2-100DPH receiving an extra dose of 100\u03BCg DNA mixed with PEI and HA. The results indicated that DNA-prime protein-boost DNA vaccination regimen targeting TCoV S fragment encompassing neutralizing epitopes induced humoral immune response and partially protected turkeys against infectious challenge by TCoV.","publish_time":"2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yi-Ning; Wu, Ching Ching; Yeo, Yoon; Xu, Peisheng; Lin, Tsang Long","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d233b4a031a21ce4991d2ce5ef41ca2ab39ec6ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112546.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.01.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242713000305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23428360/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242713000305","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","IFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TCoV S fragment","\u03BCg DNA vaccine","vaccinated turkeys","R S fragment","protected turkeys","challenge control turkeys","number of turkeys","protein fragment","DNA-prime protein-boost DNA vaccination regimen","extra dose","highest level of TCoV S protein-specific antibody","corresponding DNA vaccine gene segment","infectious challenge","TCoV viral RNA loads","challenge control groups","recombinant protein","neutralizing epitopes","vaccination groups","DDP","PEI","DPH","IFA","G3","G1","humoral immune response","immunofluorescence antibody","group G2","quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR","virus neutralization","clinical signs","spike","polyethyleneimine","VN","protection efficacy","sodium hyaluronate","assay","turkey coronavirus","titer","doses","results","present study"],"language":"en"},

Participatory disease surveillance mechanisms have already been adopted in countries for the current pandemic. India, with scarce resources, good telecom support, and a not-so-robust heath care system, makes a strong case for introducing participatory disease surveillance for the prevention and control of the pandemic. India has just launched Aarogya Setu, which is a first-of-its-kind participatory disease surveillance initiative in India. This will supplement the existing Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme in India by finding missing cases and having faster aggregation, analysis of data, and prompt response measures. This newly created platform empowers communities with the right information and guidance, enabling protection from infection and reducing unnecessary contact with the overburdened health care system. However, caution needs to be exercised to address participation from digitally isolated populations, ensure the reliability of data, and consider ethical concerns such as maintaining individual privacy.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garg, Suneela; Bhatnagar, Nidhi; Gangadharan, Navya","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164788.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/18795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287038/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aarogya Setu"],"organizations":["Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["India","Participatory disease surveillance mechanisms","coronavirus disease pandemic","kind participatory disease surveillance initiative","existing Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme","deployment of novel surveillance strategies","current pandemic","analysis of data","overburdened health care system","reliability of data","robust heath care system","unnecessary contact","strong case","protection","missing cases","right information","communities","guidance","faster aggregation","scarce resources","prevention","ethical concerns","good telecom support","infection","control","prompt response measures","created platform","isolated populations","individual privacy","countries","participation","Aarogya Setu","community","caution"],"language":"en"},

Cotransfection yielded plaque-forming virus that synthesized the standard genomic and subgenomic RNAs and thus was generated by RNA\u2013RNA recombination. Using transcripts tagged with a 3\u2032-terminal deletion, it was found that recombinants contained the 3\u2032 end derived from the replicative strand, indicating a cis-preference for initiation of negative-strand synthesis. In cotransfections in which the replicative transcript lacked the 3\u2032 CSE, recombination occurred, albeit at lower efficiency, indicating that initiation in trans from the NS-ORF can occur. The 3\u2032 CSE was sufficient as a nonreplicative transcript, showing that it can serve as a promoter for negative-strand RNA synthesis. While deletion mutagenesis showed that the presence of the junction untranslated region (J-UTR) between the ORFs appeared to be necessary on both transcripts for recombination in this region of the genome, analysis with transcripts tagged with restriction sites showed that the J-UTR was not a hot spot for recombination compared to neighboring regions in both ORFs. Sequence analysis of recombinants revealed that both precise (homologous) and imprecise recombination (aberrant, homologous resulting in duplications) occurred; however, imprecise recombination only involved the J-UTR or the 3\u2032 end of the NS-ORF and the J-UTR (maintaining the NS-ORF), indicating selection pressure against duplications in other regions of the genome.","publish_time":"2003-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adams, Sandra D.; Tzeng, Wen-Pin; Chen, Min-Hsin; Frey, Teryl K.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b817e2c1f5eac1e15d2b6f6e14e6ed72a002465.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126107.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203000643; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203000643","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","CSE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA recombination","NS-ORF","imprecise recombination","J-UTR","SP-ORF","CSE","transcripts","genome","intermolecular RNA","negative-strand RNA synthesis","replicative strand","nonreplicative transcript","end","RNA replication competent","strand synthesis","initiation of negative","duplications","ORFs","deletion mutagenesis","terminal deletion","Sequence analysis of recombinants","homologous resulting","cis-preference","rubella virus","neighboring regions","junction untranslated region","cis-acting elements","proximal structural protein","genomic cDNA plasmid vectors","nonoverlapping deletions","presence","pairs of","hot spot","cells","selection pressure","restriction sites","replicase","promoter","subgenomic RNAs","lower efficiency","half","plaque","cotransfections"],"language":"en"},

Due to this proposed concern, we sought to collect the available data and evaluate the use of laparoscopy and the risk of COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID-19 virus was performed. We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic. RESULTS: Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery, but to date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open or laparoscopic. There is no societal consensus on limiting or restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery; however, there is expert consensus on the modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Despite very little evidence to support viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, we recommend making modifications to surgical practice such as the use of smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device use among other measures to minimize operative staff exposure to aerosolized particles.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vigneswaran, Yalini; Prachand, Vivek N.; Posner, Mitchell C.; Matthews, Jeffrey B.; Hussain, Mustafa","journal":"J Gastrointest Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5531384e473b62585964dfa67c3021474f1b45b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153352.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-020-04592-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32285338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of transmission","proposed risk of viral transmission","literature review of viral transmission","risk of COVID","use of laparoscopy","robotic surgery","energy device use","use of smoke evacuation","surgical practice","surgical treatment","available literature","proposed concern","surgical society guidelines","open approaches","expert consensus","available data","societal consensus","measures","operative staff exposure","recommendations","modification of standard practices","little evidence","coronavirus disease","aerosolized particles","modifications","METHODS","date","studies","invasive techniques","CONCLUSIONS","surgeons","pandemic","creation of pneumoperitoneum","INTRODUCTION","study","RESULTS","ability"],"language":"en"},

Coronavirus infections are highly species specific with virus exhibiting a strong tissue and cell specificity. In this report we evaluated the cellular basis of JHM virus retinal tropism. Retinal cultures and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)-retinal mixed cell cultures were prepared from eyes obtained from Balb/c mice. The ability of JHM virus to infect and replicate in these retinal cultures was evaluated by light microscopy, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopy, and virus isolation. Cytopathology was not observed and virus could not be detected in supernatant fluid in retinal cultures. However, low levels of infectious virus could be detected within the cells for the first 4 days. This observation suggested that cell-to-cell interactions may be critical since virus particles and virus antigens can be seen in vivo within the neural retina and the RPE. In contrast to the retinal cultures, retinal-RPE mixed cultures were supportive to JHM virus replication. Syncytial cytopathology was observed for the first 4 days and virus was isolated from supernatant fluids. By electron microscopy, virus was found intracellularly within vacuoles and extracellularly at the plasma membrane. After Day 4, a persistent virus infection was established in which cells produced virus for 5 weeks without cytopathic effects or cell death. Double-labeling immunofluorescent studies of retinal-RPE mixed cultures showed that the virus antigen was co-expressed with a Muller cell marker, glutamine synthetase. This cell is the most prominent glial element in the retina. These studies demonstrate that JHM virus is capable of establishing a persistent virus infection in mixed retinal (Muller)-RPE cell cultures. Moreover, these data suggest that cell-to-cell interactions influence the establishment of coronavirus infections in the retina.","publish_time":"1993-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yun; Detrick, Barbara; Hooks, John J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5c3d42324fbdb5585f907ded8216319b4e93cc3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682283711098; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682283711098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Retinal cultures","virus particles","virus antigens","virus isolation","retinal mixed cell cultures","RPE cell cultures","JHM virus replication","ability of JHM virus","retinal-RPE mixed cultures","persistent virus infection","mouse hepatitis virus","cellular basis of JHM virus retinal tropism","cell interactions","cell death","cell specificity","immunofluorescent studies of retinal","low levels of infectious virus","retinal degenerative disease","retinal pigment epithelial","Muller cell marker","JHM strain","electron microscopy","light microscopy","establishment of coronavirus infections","murine coronavirus","c mice","cells","neural retina","days","immunofluorescent staining","adult BALB","supernatant fluids","Syncytial cytopathology","weeks","eyes","species specific","strong tissue","cytopathic effects","glutamine synthetase","prominent glial element","vacuoles","Double","contrast","plasma membrane","report","observation","data"],"language":"en"},

Here we use phospho-specific flow cytometry to assess perturbations of many different cellular signaling pathways during treatment with drug combinations that are highly effective in blocking Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. We discovered two antiviral drug combinations act on distinct signaling pathways, either STAT1 or S6 phosphorylation, to block HSV-1 infection. We focused on upregulation of S6 phosphorylation by HSV-1 infection, and our subsequent finding that ribavirin antagonizes this upregulation of S6 phosphorylation. We go on to show that the S6 kinase inhibitor SL0101 blocks HSV-1 replication in vitro and in an in vivo animal model of HSV-1 infection. Overall, we have used an unbiased analysis of cellular signaling pathways during treatment by antiviral drug combinations to discover a novel antiviral drug target against HSV-1 infection. The outcomes of the approach we present highlight the importance of analyzing how antiviral drugs modulate cellular and pathogen-induced signaling as a method to discover new drug therapy targets.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Xianting; Krutzik, Peter O.; Ghaffari, Amir Ali; Zhaozhi, Yixiu; Miranda, Daniel; Cheng, Genhong; Ho, Chih-Ming; Nolan, Garry P.; Sanchez, David Jesse","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd84dc607d49e49f0d2887344d3eab3f2b95e187.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114107.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354219300221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513822/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354219300221; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104598","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection","antiviral drug resistance","antiviral drug combinations act","novel antiviral drug target","antiviral drugs","antiviral therapeutics","pathways","upregulation of S6 phosphorylation","animal model of HSV","new drug therapy targets","S6 kinase inhibitor SL0101 blocks HSV","treatment","unbiased analysis of cellular","new viruses","blocking Herpes simplex virus type","perturbations","replication","method","ribavirin","phospho-specific flow cytometry","strategies","subsequent finding","pathogen","STAT1","pressing need","importance","approach","outcomes"],"language":"en"},

This study provides an insight on the various immune mediators detected in FCoV-positive cats which may be responsible for the development of FIP. RESULTS: In this study, using real-time PCR and multiplex bead-based immunoassay, the expression profiles of several immune mediators were examined in Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cells infected with the feline coronavirus (FCoV) strain FIPV 79\u20131146 and in samples obtained from FCoV-positive cats. CRFK cells infected with FIPV 79\u20131146 showed an increase in the expression of interferon-related genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as MX1, viperin, CXCL10, CCL8, RANTES, KC, MCP1, and IL8. In addition, an increase in the expression of the above cytokines as well as GM-CSF and IFN\u03B3 was also detected in the PBMC, serum, and peritoneal effusions of FCoV-positive cats. Although the expression of MX1 and viperin genes was variable between cats, the expression of these two genes was relatively higher in cats having peritoneal effusion compared to cats without clinically obvious effusion. Higher viral load was also detected in the supernatant of peritoneal effusions compared to in the plasma of FCoV-positive cats. As expected, the secretion of IL1\u03B2, IL6 and TNF\u03B1 was readily detected in the supernatant of peritoneal effusions of the FCoV-positive cats. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified various pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon-related genes such as MX1, viperin, CXCL10, CCL8, RANTES, KC, MCP1, IL8, GM-CSF and IFN\u03B3 in FCoV-positive cats. With the exception of MX1 and viperin, no distinct pattern of immune mediators was observed that distinguished between FCoV-positive cats with and without peritoneal effusion. Further studies based on definitive diagnosis of FIP need to be performed to confirm the clinical importance of this study.","publish_time":"2017-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Safi, Nikoo; Haghani, Amin; Ng, Shing Wei; Selvarajah, Gayathri Thevi; Mustaffa-Kamal, Farina; Omar, Abdul Rahman","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebd781f1bacf68fbaa6efa2aff4390c20a405999.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5384144.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28388950/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1019-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP","CRFK","FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FCoV-positive cats","peritoneal effusions of FCoV","plasma of FCoV","expression of MX1","viperin genes","study","expression of interferon","biotypes of feline coronavirus","supernatant of peritoneal effusions","expression profiles","self-limiting feline enteric coronavirus","feline infectious peritonitis virus","interferon-related genes","various immune mediators","exception of MX1","various pro-inflammatory cytokines","Crandell-Reese feline kidney","CCL8","KC","RANTES","MCP1","CXCL10","distinct pattern of immune mediators","GM-CSF","strain FIPV","IFN\u03B3","IL8","CRFK cells","obvious effusion","development of FIP","increase","definitive diagnosis of FIP","Higher viral load","multiplex bead-based immunoassay","FECV","real-time PCR","variable","TNF\u03B1","PBMC","fatal disease","insight","serum","samples","multi-cat environments","secretion of IL1\u03B2","IL6","studies","clinical importance","CONCLUSIONS","addition","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized(2).

Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced viral infection of cells, and reciprocally, ectopic expression resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to CHIKV particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked CHIKV infection in multiple cell types including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of CHIKV E2, a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of Mxr8a-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies reduced CHIKV or ONNV infection and associated foot swelling in mice.

In this study, we demonstrate that only the first domain, PLPD-1, is responsible for this cleavage, as deletion of the second domain did not affect the formation of the 87-kDa protein. Site-directed mutagenesis studies further showed that a previously predicted nucleophilic cysteine residue (Cys1274) and a histidine residue (His1437) were essential for the proteinase activity, indicating that they may be important components of the catalytic center of the proteinase. Meanwhile, expression of a series of deletion mutants revealed that the 87-kDa protein was encoded by the 5\u2032-most 2.6 kb of ORF 1a. Deletion and amino acid substitution mutation studies demonstrated that the Gly673\u2013Gly674dipeptide bond was most likely the cleavage site responsible for releasing the C-terminus of the 87-kDa protein from the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins.","publish_time":"1998-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, K.

The death of A549 cells induced by A \u002B N morphologically resembles inflammation-inducing pyroptosis - cell destruction triggered by activated caspase-1. The treatment with A \u002B N (or camptothecin) strongly upregulated caspase-1 and its two activators: IFI16 and NLRP1, however, caspase-1 activation was not detected. A549 cells may have been primed for pyroptosis, with the absence of a crucial trigger. The investigation of additional innate immunity elements revealed that A \u002B N (or camptothecin) stimulated the expression of NLRX1, STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and two antiviral proteins, IFIT1 and IFIT3. IFI16 and caspase-1 are coded by p53-regulated genes which led us to investigate regulation of NLRP1, NLRX1, STING, IFIT1 and IFIT3 in p53-dependent mode. The upregulation of NLRP1, NLRX1 and STING was attenuated in p53 knockdown cells. The upsurge of the examined genes, and activation of p53, was inhibited by C16, an inhibitor of PKR kinase. PKR was tested due to its ability to phosphorylate p53 on Ser392. Surprisingly, C16 was active even in PKR knockdown cells. The ability of C16 to prevent activation of p53 and expression of innate immunity genes may be the source of its strong anti-inflammatory action. Moreover, cells exposed to A \u002B N can influence neighboring cells in paracrine fashion, for instance, they shed ectodomain of COL17A1 protein and induce, in p53-dependent mode, the expression of gene for interleukin-7. Further, the activation of p53 also spurred the expression of SOCS1, an inhibitor of interferon triggered STAT1-dependent signaling. We conclude that, stimulation of p53 primes cells for the production of interferons (through upregulation of STING), and may activate negative-feedback within this signaling system by enhancing the production of SOCS1.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krze\u015Bniak, Ma\u0142gorzata; Zajkowicz, Artur; Gdowicz-K\u0142osok, Agnieszka; G\u0142owala-Kosi\u0144ska, Magdalena; \u0141asut-Szyszka, Barbara; Rusin, Marek","journal":"Cellular Signalling","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fb07c0520781ebd106f2bb752c8a54b60362656.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126238.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109552; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0898656820300292; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656820300292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32032660/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["STING"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activation of p53","p53 knockdown cells","p53-regulated genes","p53-dependent mode","stimulation of p53 primes cells","neighboring cells","PKR knockdown cells","expression of NLRX1","death of A549 cells","expression of innate immunity genes","upregulation of STING","expression of SOCS1","expression of gene","examined genes","upregulation of NLRP1","ability of C16","upregulated caspase","stimulator of interferon genes","inhibitor of interferon","IFIT3","IFIT1","STAT1-dependent","production of SOCS1","inhibitor of PKR kinase","camptothecin","Ser392","IFI16","production of interferons","investigation of additional innate immunity elements","pyroptosis - cell destruction","source","instance","antiviral proteins","paracrine fashion","system","inflammation","ectodomain of COL17A1 protein","Abstract Actinomycin D","nutlin","strong anti-inflammatory action","absence","induction of phosphorylation","activators","negative-feedback","crucial trigger","upsurge","interleukin","treatment"],"language":"en"},

Entry processes are commonly analyzed by monitoring internalized virus particles via Western blotting, polymerase chain reaction, and imaging techniques that allow scientist to track the intracellular location of the pathogen. Such studies have provided abundant direct evidence on how viruses interact with receptor molecules on the cell surface, induce cell signaling at the point of initial contact with the cell to facilitate internalization, and exploit existing endocytic mechanisms of the cell for their ultimate infectious agenda. However, there is dearth of knowledge in regards to trafficking of a virus via endosomes. Herein, we describe an optimized laboratory procedure to isolate individual organelles during different stages of endocytosis by performing subcellular fractionation. This methodology is established using Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells as a model. With KSHV and other herpesviruses alike, envelope glycoproteins have been widely reported to physically engage target cell surface receptors, such as integrins, in interactions leading to entry and subsequent infection. RESULTS: Subcellular fractionation was used to isolate early and late endosomes (EEs and LEs) by performing a series of centrifugations steps. Specifically, a centrifugation step post-homogenization was utilized to obtain the post-nuclear supernatant containing intact intracellular organelles in suspension. Successive fractionation via sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed to isolate specific organelles including EEs and LEs. Intracellular KSHV trafficking was directly traced in the isolated endosomal fractions. Additionally, the subcellular fractionation approach demonstrates a key role for integrins in the endosomal trafficking of KSHV. The results obtained from fractionation studies corroborated those obtained by traditional imaging studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind to employ a sucrose flotation gradient assay to map intracellular KSHV trafficking in HFF cells. We are confident that such an approach will serve as a powerful tool to directly study intracellular trafficking of a virus, signaling events occurring on endosomal membranes, and dynamics of molecular events within endosomes that are crucial for uncoating and virus escape into the cytosol.","publish_time":"2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker, Lia R.; Hussein, Hosni A.

In this study, the full-length genomes of eight avian gamma-coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates were sequenced and along with other full-length IBV genomes available from GenBank were analyzed for recombination. Evidence of recombination was found in every sequence analyzed and was distributed throughout the entire genome. Areas that have the highest occurrence of recombination are located in regions of the genome that code for nonstructural proteins 2, 3 and 16, and the structural spike glycoprotein. The extent of the recombination observed, suggests that this may be one of the principal mechanisms for generating genetic and antigenic diversity within IBV. These data indicate that reticulate evolutionary change due to recombination in IBV, likely plays a major role in the origin and adaptation of the virus leading to new genetic types and strains of the virus.","publish_time":"2011-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thor, Sharmi W.; Hilt, Deborah A.; Kissinger, Jessica C.; Paterson, Andrew H.; Jackwood, Mark W.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5adc6c6cf5b6d7306ed52327e9ccec7a1512f1e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3187689.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994806/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v3091777","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extent of recombination","Evidence of recombination","highest occurrence of recombination","full-length IBV genomes available","avian gamma-coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","emergence","avian gamma-coronaviruses","different species of coronavirus","full-length genomes","turkey coronavirus","limited data available","entire genome","new genetic types","evolution of different coronaviral genotypes","frequency","adaptation","nature","GenBank","antigenic diversity","code","origin","major role","strains","regions","isolates","evolutionary change","principal mechanisms","nonstructural proteins","contributing factor","family Coronaviridae","structural spike glycoprotein","Areas","study","sequence"],"language":"en"},

Over the last few years, researchers have advanced the mathematical theory of scale-free networks and used such theoretical advancements in pilot epidemic models. Scale-free contact networks are particularly interesting in the realm of mathematical epidemiology, primarily because these networks may allow meaningfully structured populations to be incorporated in epidemic models at moderate or intermediate levels of complexity. Moreover, a scale-free contact network with node degree correlation is in accord with the well-known preferred mixing concept. The present author describes a semi-empirical and deterministic epidemic modeling approach that (a) focuses on time-varying rates of disease transmission in both unstructured and structured populations and (b) employs probability density functions to characterize disease progression and outbreak controls. Given an epidemic curve for a historical outbreak, this modeling approach calls for Monte Carlo calculations (that define the average new infection rate) and solutions to integro-differential equations (that describe outbreak dynamics in an aggregate population or across all network connectivity classes).

RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have emerged as important regulators of virus-host cell interactions. In this study, the specific effect of RNAi on the replication of ORFV was explored. The application of RNA interference (RNAi) inhibited the replication of ORFV in cell culture by targeting the ORF025 gene of ORFV, which encodes the viral polymerase. Three small interfering RNA (siRNA) (named siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388) were prepared by in vitro transcription. The siRNAs were evaluated for antiviral activity against the ORFV Jilin isolate by the observation of cytopathic effects (CPE), virus titration, and real-time PCR. After 48 h of infection, siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388 reduced virus titers by 59- to 199-fold and reduced the level of viral replication by 73-89 %. These results suggest that these three siRNAs can efficiently inhibit ORFV genome replication and infectious virus production. RNAi targeting of the DNA polymerase gene is therefore potentially useful for studying the replication of ORFV and may have potential therapeutic applications.","publish_time":"2013-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Gaili; He, Wenqi; Song, Deguang; Li, Jida; Bao, Yingfu; Lu, Rongguang; Bi, Jingying; Zhao, Kui; Gao, Feng","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39c3cd333c7f1556827c2318f07b93cb90e81553.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4010719.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1896-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24178308/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORFV","ORFV Jilin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of ORFV","ORFV genome replication","ORFV Jilin","orf virus","ORF025 gene of ORFV","virus titration","virus titers","level of viral replication","important regulators of virus","infectious virus production","siRNA1017","siRNA704","specific effect of RNAi","siRNA1388","application of RNA interference","siRNAs","viral polymerase","DNA polymerase gene","small interfering RNA","cell culture","host cell interactions","CPE","observation of cytopathic effects","pathways","antiviral activity","h of infection","potential therapeutic applications","study","real-time PCR","sheep","goat","fold","countries","results","transcription"],"language":"en"},

This study determined whether environmental exposures derived from GigaPan\u00AE images could serve as valid predictors of body mass index (BMI), walking and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in a longitudinal study of low-income adults living in two primarily African American neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. GigaPan\u00AE is a robotic system used to obtain high-resolution, panoramic images of environments. METHODS: Microscale environmental features along 481 streets were audited in 2015\u20132016 using an audit form. Environmental exposures were estimated for 731 adult participants, using a sample of street segments within a 0.4 km (0.25 mile) network distance from each participant\u0027s residential address. Summary environmental exposures were constructed using factor analysis. We tested associations between participant-level environmental exposures and objectively measured BMI, self-reported walking and objectively measured MVPA in regression models controlling for baseline health and demographic variables. RESULTS: Three factors representing participants\u2019 environmental exposures were constructed: pedestrian bicycle-amenities; hilly-vacant-boarded; physical activity-recreation/low housing density. Environments with infrastructure and amenities supportive of walking and bicycling were associated with lower BMI (Coef. = \u20120.47, p = 0.02). Frequent walking was less likely in environments with more physical activity and recreation venues/low housing density (OR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.67, 0.96]). MVPA was not associated with any of the environmental measures and the hilly-vacant-boarded factor was not associated with any of the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Predictive validity was demonstrated for an environmental exposure factor that captured features supportive of walking and cycling in a model predicting BMI, using built environment audit data from GigaPan\u00AE imagery. A complementary analysis found lower odds of frequent walking in the neighborhood among participants with exposure to more physical activity and recreational features, but fewer types and lower density of housing.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antonakos, Cathy; Baiers, Ross; Dubowitz, Tamara; Clarke, Philippa; Colabianchi, Natalie","journal":"J Transp Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2349104d02cc02ba55108b70697146d182902492.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196415.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368490/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140520300712?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2020.100867; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214140520300712","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMI","MVPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["participants\u2019 environmental exposures","Summary environmental exposures","environmental measures","environmental exposure factor","Microscale environmental features","participant-level environmental exposures","features supportive of walking","lower BMI","physical activity-recreation","amenities supportive of walking","measured BMI","vigorous physical activity","lower odds of frequent walking","lower density of housing","GigaPan","self-reported walking","low housing density","measured MVPA","factor analysis","boarded factor","recreational features","hilly-vacant","panoramic images of environments","built environment audit data","recreation venues","baseline health","adult participants","complementary analysis","audit form","pedestrian bicycle-amenities","different measurement methods","longitudinal study of low-income adults","fewer types","regression models","studies of disadvantaged populations","African American neighborhoods","valid predictors of body mass index","network distance","Pittsburgh","Pennsylvania","bicycling","participant\u0027s residential address","imagery","factors","associations","infrastructure","demographic variables","robotic system","Predictive validity","mile","USA","sample of street segments","RESULTS","streets","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Coef","outcomes"],"language":"en"},

As previously shown, a lower pre-existing anti-MHV antibody level was found in susceptible HIII mice as compared to resistant LIII mice. Mortality rates of the F1 (H\u00D7L) hybrids and F2 and backcross segregants reflected co-dominance of both characters and the survivors had higher pre-existing anti-MHV antibody titers. The present data show that both lines had the potential to synthesize antibodies and that the resistance acquired by the susceptible HIII mice paralleled the antibody synthesis. Nevertheless, higher antibody titers were necessary to confer resistance in HIII mice than in LIII ones. When compared to uvMHV3, a single immunization with a related infectious MHV strain induced a higher antibody synthesis and led the HIII mice to resist the MHV3 challenge. A direct correlation between the antibody level and resistance to infection was always observed in HIII mice. Although mounting a Th2 response as indicated by IgG1 responses, they were also able to readily synthesize large amounts of IgG2a antibodies after immunization or during infection, reflecting a Th1 response. The transfer of anti-MHV antibodies to susceptible HIII mice was capable of conferring resistance to MHV3, providing the antibodies were present before virus infection and in large amounts. The resistance and the survival time of these animals increased with the level of antibody administered. If these direct and clear data suggest that HIII mice can acquire resistance through antibodies, the basis of the resistance of the resistant LIII mice may rely on mechanisms less dependent on antibodies.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vass\u00E3o, Ruth C.; Consales, Cleide A.; Sant\u0027Anna, Osvaldo A.; Pereira, Carlos A.","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73dcb608131147679066aeaa03ce878d328f5542.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298504701886; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298504701886","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIII","LIII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["susceptible HIII mice","level of antibody","resistant LIII mice","antibody responsiveness","higher antibody synthesis","higher antibody titers","modified lines of mice","higher pre-existing anti-MHV antibody titers","lower pre-existing anti-MHV antibody level","transfer of anti-MHV antibodies","capable of conferring resistance","large amounts of IgG2a antibodies","LIII ones","virus infection","MHV3 challenge","present data","related infectious MHV strain","single immunization","direct correlation","clear data","Th2 response","Th1 response","survivors","F2","characters","backcross segregants","co-dominance","original model","hybrids","mechanisms","study","F1","IgG1 responses","animals","basis","immunological patterns","Mortality rates","survival time","Summary","aim","uvMHV3","potential"],"language":"en"},

Among viruses, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SIV), alone or in combination, are the two main known contributors to lung infectious diseases. Previous studies demonstrated that experimental dual infections of pigs with PRRSV followed by SIV can cause more severe disease than the single viral infections. However, our understanding of the impact of one virus on the other at the molecular level is still extremely limited. Thus, the aim of the current study was to determine the influence of dual infections, compared to single infections, in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and precision cut lung slices (PCLS). PAMs were isolated and PCLS were acquired from the lungs of healthy 8-week-old pigs. Then, PRRSV (ATCC VR-2385) and a local SIV strain of H1N1 subtype (A/Sw/Saskatchewan/18789/02) were applied simultaneously or with 3h apart on PAMs and PCLS for a total of 18h. Immuno-staining for both viruses and beta-tubulin, real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA assays targeting various genes (pathogen recognition receptors, interferons (IFN) type I, cytokines, and IFN-inducible genes) and proteins were performed to analyze the cell and the tissue responses. Interference caused by the first virus on replication of the second virus was observed, though limited. On the host side, a synergistic effect between PRRSV and SIV co-infections was observed for some transcripts such as TLR3, RIG-I, and IFN\u03B2 in PCLS. The PRRSV infection 3h prior to SIV infection reduced the response to SIV while the SIV infection prior to PRRSV infection had limited impact on the second infection. This study is the first to show an impact of PRRSV/SIV co-infection and superinfections in the cellular and tissue immune response at the molecular level. It opens the door to further research in this exciting and intriguing field.","publish_time":"2014-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dobrescu, I.; Levast, B.; Lai, K.; Delgado-Ortega, M.; Walker, S.; Banman, S.; Townsend, H.; Simon, G.; Zhou, Y.; Gerdts, V.; Meurens, F.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb91fc4ab4d7aff52357bfc8830954bcacdf5f30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117334.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113513005634; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113513005634; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.11.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418046/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCLS","SIV","PRRSV/SIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SIV infection","PRRSV infection","SIV co-infections","impact of PRRSV","PCLS","single infections","single viral infections","PAMs","limited impact","influence of dual infections","respiratory syndrome virus","swine influenza virus","experimental dual infections of pigs","local SIV strain of H1N1 subtype","viruses","molecular level","Abstract Viral respiratory diseases","IFN-inducible genes","lung infectious diseases","tissue immune response","various genes","week-old pigs","tissue responses","current study","porcine alveolar macrophages","precision cut lung slices","ELISA assays","real-time quantitative PCR","pathogen recognition receptors","superinfections","beta-tubulin","main known contributors","synergistic effect","interferons","severe disease","research","proteins","cytokines","transcripts","Previous studies","lungs of healthy","intriguing field","cell","Immuno-staining","combination","ATCC VR","TLR3","door","Saskatchewan","host","aim","IFN\u03B2","total","understanding","replication","Interference"],"language":"en"},

However, recent studies suggest that functional compartmentalization and limited reciprocity may exist within some components of the common mucosal immune system. Although oral immunization is often very effective in inducing immunity to respiratory pathogens, the converse (respiratory immunization to prevent enteric diseases) may not be as effective. To address this question and to study interactions between the bronchus-associated (BALT) and gut-associated (GALT) lymphoid tissues related to protective immunity, we used as a model two antigenically related porcine coronaviruses which replicate primarily in the intestine (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV) or respiratory tract (porcine respiratory coronavirus, PRCV). The tissue distribution and magnitude of the antibody secreting cell (ASC) responses (measured by ELISPOT) and cell-mediated immune responses (measured by lymphoproliferative assays, LPA) coincided with the viral tissue tropisms. Immunization via GALT (gut infection with TGEV) elicited high numbers of IgA ASC and high LPA responses in GALT (gut lamina propria, LP or mesenteric lymph nodes, MLN), but lower responses in BALT (bronchial lymph nodes, BLN) and induced complete protection against enteric TGEV challenge. In contrast immunization via BALT (respiratory infection with PRCV) elicited systemic type responses (high numbers of IgG ASC in the BLN), but few ASC and low LPA responses in the gut LP or MLN and induced only partial protection against enteric TGEV challenge. Thus administration of vaccines intranasally may not be optimally effective for inducing intestinal immunity in contrast to the reported efficacy of oral vaccines for inducing respiratory immunity.","publish_time":"1996-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2027d9c3fb68436bbc32d7525e4a5fa5055ccfec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242796057029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242796057029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","PRCV","ASC","LPA","GALT","BALT","IgG ASC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory immunity","respiratory immunization","immune responses","high LPA responses","respiratory infection","lower responses","respiratory tract","respiratory pathogens","inducing immunity","low LPA responses","gut LP","gut infection","porcine respiratory coronavirus","GALT","enteric TGEV challenge","BALT","contrast immunization","oral immunization","high numbers of IgA ASC","common mucosal immune system","systemic type responses","high numbers of IgG ASC","protective immunity","intestinal immunity","gut lamina propria","mucosal site results","distant mucosal sites","MLN","BLN","PRCV","tissue distribution","enteric diseases","mesenteric lymph nodes","bronchial lymph nodes","related porcine coronaviruses","distribution of antigen","complete protection","partial protection","reported efficacy of oral vaccines","administration of vaccines","antibody secreting cell","viral tissue tropisms","specific IgA precursor cells","antigenic stimulation","components","converse","functional compartmentalization","intestine","magnitude","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","tenet","limited reciprocity","lymphoid tissues","model","lymphoproliferative assays","ELISPOT","recent studies","study interactions","bronchus","question","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Studies on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have contributed to characterization of the HIV-1 frameshifting site and have demonstrated that frameshifting is conserved from yeast to humans. Yeast has also proved a particularly useful model organism for deciphering the mechanisms of translation termination in eukaryotes and identifying the factors required to obtain a high level of natural suppression. These findings open up new possibilities for large-scale screening in yeast to identify new drugs for blocking HIV replication by inhibiting frameshifting or restoring production of the full-length protein from a gene inactivated by a premature termination codon.

In conclusion, analysis of cytokines concentrations and SNP for the four tested genes can be used as a predictor of sepsis outcome in newborns.","publish_time":"2015-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Allam, Gamal; Alsulaimani, Adnan A.; Alzaharani, Ali K.; Nasr, Amre","journal":"Cent Eur J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc363739ad7ec8d796aba6af478d986a4c0f5f3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4472542.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5114/ceji.2015.50836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26155186/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","EOS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TNF-\u03B1","circulating IL","IFN-\u03B3","outcome of sepsis","cytokines SNP","interferon \u03B3","Saudi infants","predictor of sepsis outcome","Saudi newborn infants","early onset sepsis","EOS patients","study","T genes","tumor necrosis factor \u03B1","sepsis-free control groups","cytokine measurements","tested genes","conflicting results","cytokine gene polymorphisms","analysis of cytokines concentrations","susceptibility","possible association","available Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","potential associations","ELISA","studies","development","Taqman","course","single nucleotide polymorphism","kit","interleukin","alleles","filter papers","inclusion criteria","Chelex","nuclease allelic discrimination","conclusion","newborns","days","research protocol","recent years","DNA","method","total","objective"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To assess clinical profiles of pediatric COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was undertaken using clinical data of sixteen children (11 months-14 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 17, 2020 at Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei province, China. RESULTS: All children had positive epidemiologic histories, 12 (12/16, 75 %) involving family units. The illnesses were either mild (5/16, 31.3 %) or ordinary (11/16, 68.8 %), presenting as follows: asymptomatic (8/16, 50 %), fever and/or cough (8/16, 50 %). Four asymptomatic patients (4/16, 25 %) in ordinary cases had chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. Leukocyte counts were normal in 14 cases(88 %), but 2 patients (12.5 %) had leukopenia, and 1 (6.3 %) was lymphopenic. There were 11 patients with chest CT abnormalities, some nodular, others small patchy and others ground-glass opacities. In asymptomatic children, the median time to SRAS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test(NAT) positivity once exposed to a family member with confirmed infection was 15.5 days (range, 10\u201326 days). The median time to first NAT-negative conversion was 5.5 days (range, 1\u201323 days). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in children of Xiangyang city is often family acquired and not serious, with favorable outcomes. Asymptomatic children can be diagnosed as pneumonia because of chest CT abnormalities. It is essential to actively screen this segment of the population.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Wenliang; Li, Junhua; Zou, Ning; Guan, Wenhe; Pan, Jiali; Xu, Wei","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11aca1c9733368aa155c2cdbb5267590296796ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195294.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301190; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361323/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Xiangyang"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic children","days","reports of children","asymptomatic patients","chest CT abnormalities","children of Xiangyang city","clinical profiles of pediatric COVID","median time","range","family member","ordinary cases","family units","chest computed tomography","SRAS-CoV","clinical data","SARS-CoV","NAT-negative conversion","Xiangyang Central Hospital","positivity","nucleic acid test","retrospective analysis","Hubei province","confirmed infection","pneumonia","China","ground-glass opacities","positive epidemiologic histories","STUDY DESIGN","Leukocyte counts","BACKGROUND","Coronavirus disease","RESULTS","months","years","segment","favorable outcomes","OBJECTIVES","world","CONCLUSIONS","illnesses","fever","cough","population","leukopenia","lymphopenic"],"language":"en"},

Movement of animals between farms is one of the most significant routes of disease transmission and is particularly hard to control for pathogens with subclinical infection. Renibacterium salmoninarum causes bacterial kidney disease (BKD) in salmonid fish, but infection is often sub-clinical and may go undetected with major potential implications for disease control programmes. A Susceptible-Infected model of R. salmoninarum in Scottish aquaculture has been developed that subdivides the infected phase between known and undetected sub-clinically infected farms and diseased farms whose status is assumed to be known. Farms officially known to be infected are subject to movement controls restricting spread of infection. Model results are sensitive to prevalence of undetected infection, which is unknown. However, the modelling suggests that controls that reduce BKD prevalence include improve biosecurity on farms, including those not known to be infected, and improved detection of infection. Culling appears of little value for BKD control. BKD prevalence for rainbow trout farms is less sensitive to controls than it is for Atlantic salmon farms and so different management strategies may be required for the sectors.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murray, Alexander G.; Hall, Malcolm; Munro, Lorna A.; Wallace, I.

In the second stage, inflammatory rhetoric is deployed by populist leaders, which scapegoat that constructed enemy. These two stages culminate to create widespread moral panic in society. With moral panic firmly established, in the third stage an environment of fear and paranoia becomes susceptible to the enactment of symbolic and physical violence against the constructed enemy.

A growing body of genetic and biochemical evidence and data from clinical trials confirms that cyclophilins are essential cofactors that contribute to establishing a permissive environment within the host cell that supports the replication of HIV-1 and HCV. Cyclophilin A regulates HIV-1 replication kinetics and infectivity, modulates sensitivity to host restriction factors, and cooperates in the transit of the pre-integration complex into the nucleus of infected cells. Cyclophilin A is an essential cofactor whose expression supports HCV-specific RNA replication in human hepatocytes. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase inhibitors have been used in clinical trials to validate cyclophilins as antiviral targets for the treatment of HIV-1 and Chronic Hepatitis C virus infection and as molecular probes to identify the roles played by immunophilins in supporting the replication cycles of human viruses. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes emerging research that defines the functions of immunophilins in supporting the replication cycles of HIV-1, HCV, HBV, coronaviruses, and other viral pathogens and describes new information that suggests a role for immunophilins in regulating innate immune responses against chronic viral infection. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The dependence on cyclophilins by evolutionarily distinct viruses for accomplishing various steps in replication such as viral entry, initiation of genomic nucleic acid replication, viral genome uncoating, nuclear import and nuclear entry, emphasizes the potential of cyclophilin inhibitors as therapeutic agents.","publish_time":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hopkins, Sam; Gallay, Philippe A.","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3be480bda004ded2bb4267481f6eeceab05a578a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9df41b5ff19e1376d8184c3a21659daef3aa239d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4491039.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416514003882; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304416514003882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445708/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.11.011; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4491039?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of HIV","replication cycles of HIV","replication kinetics","replication cycles of human viruses","cyclophilins","HCV-specific RNA replication","viral entry","chronic viral infection","viral pathogens","treatment of HIV","functions of immunophilins","initiation of genomic nucleic acid replication","viral genome uncoating","nuclear entry","clinical trials","potential of cyclophilin inhibitors","distinct viruses","human hepatocytes","roles","nuclear import","essential cofactors","SCOPE OF REVIEW","host cell","Chronic Hepatitis C virus infection","Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase inhibitors","biochemical evidence","innate immune responses","data","expression","molecular probes","antiviral targets","various steps","pre-integration complex","sensitivity","dependence","infectivity","GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE","new information","emerging research","growing body of genetic","transit","nucleus of infected cells","therapeutic agents","coronaviruses","HBV","permissive environment","restriction factors","MAJOR CONCLUSIONS","Tremendous progress","BACKGROUND","years"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Of 302 MERS critically ill patients, NIV was used initially in 105 (35%) patients, whereas 197 (65%) patients were only managed with invasive MV. Patients who were managed with NIV initially had lower baseline SOFA score and less extensive infiltrates on chest radiograph compared with patients managed with invasive MV. The vast majority (92.4%) of patients who were managed initially with NIV required intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation, and were more likely to require inhaled nitric oxide compared to those who were managed initially with invasive MV. ICU and hospital length of stay were similar between NIV patients and invasive MV patients.

Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance.

Viruses contribute to the etiology of ARTIs in a big way compared with other microorganisms. Since the discovery of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 61 years ago, the virus has been recognized as a major cause of ARTI and hospitalization in children. The morbidity and mortality attributable to RSV infection appear to be higher in infants \u003C 3 months and in those with known risk factors such as prematurity, chronic lung, and congenital heart diseases. Crowded living conditions, exposure to tobacco smoke, and industrial or other types of air pollution also increase the risk of RSV-associated ARTI. Many epidemiological studies have been conducted in developed countries to understand the seasonal patterns and risk factors associated with RSV infections. Dearth of information on RSV-associated morbidity and mortality in Asian and developing countries indicates the need for regional reviews to evaluate RSV-associated disease burden in these countries. Epidemiological studies including surveillance is the key to track the disease burden including risk factors, seasonality, morbidity, and mortality associated with RSV infection in these countries. These data will contribute to improve the clinical diagnosis and plan preventive strategies in resource-limited developing countries.","publish_time":"2018-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Divarathne, Maduja Vyanga Manike; Ahamed, Rukshan Rafeek; Noordeen, Faseeha","journal":"J Pediatr Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9e8403016965e4c7e7e3265cef147658a3e2668.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117084.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1637752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32300274/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARTI","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk of RSV","RSV-associated morbidity","RSV infections","RSV-associated disease burden","associated ARTI","developing countries","developed countries","known risk factors","global infectious disease burden","mortality attributable","epidemiological studies","etiology of ARTIs","Acute respiratory tract infections","discovery of respiratory syncytial virus","life years","major cause of ARTI","leading contributors","chronic lung","tobacco smoke","exposure","prematurity","seasonality","preventive strategies","seasonal patterns","regional reviews","resource","need","key","Crowded living conditions","congenital heart diseases","types of air pollution","clinical diagnosis","big way","hospitalization","months","Dearth of information","children","infants","surveillance","microorganisms","disability","Viruses","data"],"language":"en"},

The continuous emergence of new IBV genotypes and lack of cross protection among different IBV genotypes have been an important challenge. Although live attenuated IB vaccines remarkably induce potent immune response, the potential risk of reversion to virulence, neutralization by the maternal antibodies, and recombination and mutation events are important concern on their usage. On the other hand, inactivated vaccines induce a weaker immune response and may require multiple dosing and/or the use of adjuvants that probably have potential safety risks and increased economic burdens. Consequently, alternative IB vaccines are widely sought. Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology have resulted in experimental IB vaccines that show promise in antibody and T-cells responses, comparable to live attenuated vaccines. Recombinant DNA vaccines have also been enhanced to target multiple serotypes and their efficacy has been improved using delivery vectors, nanoadjuvants, and in ovo vaccination approaches. Although most recombinant IB DNA vaccines are yet to be licensed, it is expected that these types of vaccines may hold sway as future vaccines for inducing a cross protection against multiple IBV serotypes.","publish_time":"2015-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bande, Faruku; Arshad, Siti Suri; Hair Bejo, Mohd; Moeini, Hassan; Omar, Abdul Rahman","journal":"J Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddbf31002935c6a62e177e3085670455ec4121ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4411447.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25954763/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/424860","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuated vaccines","experimental IB vaccines","inactivated vaccines","future vaccines","alternative IB vaccines","recombinant IB DNA vaccines","types of vaccines","Recombinant DNA vaccines","live attenuated IB vaccines","multiple IBV serotypes","multiple serotypes","recombinant DNA technology","different IBV genotypes","multiple dosing","lack of cross protection","potent immune response","weaker immune response","continuous emergence of new IBV genotypes","important concern","poultry industry","important challenge","potential safety risks","potential risk of reversion","huge economic impact","increased economic burdens","distributed poultry disease","mutation events","recombination","virulence","antibody","promise","T-cells responses","maternal antibodies","nanoadjuvants","neutralization","use of adjuvants","efficacy","Recent advances","sway","delivery vectors","ovo vaccination approaches","usage","Avian infectious bronchitis","hand"],"language":"en"},

The abundance on the virion and the major stimulus for the virus-neutralizing antibodies makes gD a predominant candidate for cure of HSV infection. In this study, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb), termed m27f, targeting to glycoprotein D (gD) of HSV-2, which also has cross-reactivity against HSV-1 gD. It has a high level of neutralizing activity against both HSV-1 and HSV-2, and binds to a highly conserved region (residues 292\u2013297) within the pro-fusion domain of gD. It can effectively block HSV cell-to-cell spread in vitro. The pre- or post-attachment neutralization assay and syncytium formation inhibition assay revealed that m27f neutralizes HSV at the post-binding stage. Moreover, therapeutic administration of m27f completely prevented infection-related mortality of mice challenged with a lethal dose of HSV-2. Our newly identified epitope for the neutralizing antibody would facilitate studies of gD-based HSV entry or vaccine design, and m27f itself demonstrated a high potential for adaptation as a protective or therapeutic drug against HSV.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Ruikun; Wang, Lili; Xu, Hao; Wang, Zhiying; Zhang, Tao; Wang, Manli; Ning, Yunjia; Deng, Fei; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin; Li, Yi","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4854e380bdd61dc0fbfdf751fe1b922778450ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113901.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217304710; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.10.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217304710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29061442/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSV cell","cure of HSV infection","based HSV entry","lethal dose of HSV","studies of gD","therapeutic administration of m27f","termed m27f","neutralizing antibody","therapeutic drug","pro-fusion domain of gD","high level of neutralizing activity","novel therapeutic strategies","post-attachment neutralization assay","monoclonal antibody","high potential","post-binding stage","syncytium formation inhibition assay","infection-related mortality of mice","worldwide prevalence of herpes simplex virus","shortage of efficient vaccines","predominant candidate","vaccine design","adaptation","antibodies","glycoprotein D","major stimulus","mAb","global concerns","virion","identified epitope","cross-reactivity","conserved region","residues","abundance","study"],"language":"en"},

Thus detection of non-structural dengue antigens may be of benefit for an early rapid diagnosis of dengue infection due to its long half life in the blood. Here we describe a simple and efficient method for the expression of NS1 in Escherichia coli, which could potentially be used to develop monoclonal and bispecific antibodies for point of care diagnostics. E. coli codon optimized synthetic full-length NS1 gene of dengue serotype 1 (DEN-1) was successfully cloned and expressed in very high-level as inclusion bodies. The NS1 protein was successfully affinity purified and refolded as a recombinant NS1 (rNS1) protein in E. coli and yield was 230\u2013250mg/L of bacterial culture. The rNS1 protein was used to immunize mice for hybridoma development.

AIM: This study aims to understand the research gaps related to COVID-19 and propose recommendations for future research. METHODS: We undertook a scoping review of COVID-19, comprehensively searching databases and other sources to identify literature on COVID-19 between 1 December 2019 and 6 February 2020. We analysed the sources, publication date, type and topic of the retrieved articles/studies. RESULTS: We included 249 articles in this scoping review. More than half (59.0%) were conducted in China. Guidance/guidelines and consensuses statements (n = 56; 22.5%) were the most common. Most (n = 192; 77.1%) articles were published in peer-reviewed journals, 35 (14.1%) on preprint servers and 22 (8.8%) posted online. Ten genetic studies (4.0%) focused on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 while the topics of molecular studies varied. Nine of 22 epidemiological studies focused on estimating the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 infection (R(0)). Of all identified guidance/guidelines (n = 35), only ten fulfilled the strict principles of evidence-based practice. The number of articles published per day increased rapidly until the end of January. CONCLUSION: The number of articles on COVID-19 steadily increased before 6 February 2020. However, they lack diversity and are almost non-existent in some study fields, such as clinical research. The findings suggest that evidence for the development of clinical practice guidelines and public health policies will be improved when more results from clinical research becomes available.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Meng; Luo, Xufei; Estill, Janne; Liu, Yunlan; Ren, Mengjuan; Wang, Jianjian; Wang, Qi; Zhao, Siya; Wang, Xiaohui; Yang, Shu; Feng, Xixi; Li, Weiguo; Liu, Enmei; Zhang, Xianzhuo; Wang, Ling; Zhou, Qi; Meng, Wenbo; Qi, Xiaolong; Xun, Yangqin; Yu, Xuan; Chen, Yaolong","journal":"Euro Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f5efad6c6fbce2d2bc914f0482384adda71f956.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5b0d0299890c7484b24e5111f2f2165fb40432fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175649.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32317050/; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2020.25.15.2000125","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["number of articles","clinical research","retrieved articles","scoping review of COVID","basic reproduction number of COVID","research gaps","future research","epidemiological studies","genetic studies","development of clinical practice guidelines","SARS-CoV","sources","RESULTS","topics of molecular studies","China","based practice","study fields","identified guidance","origin of SARS","strict principles of evidence","type","public health policies","publication date","novel coronavirus","infection","consensuses statements","databases","literature","day","recommendations","peer-reviewed journals","pneumonia","findings","Wuhan","METHODS","CONCLUSION","preprint servers","diversity","AIM","BACKGROUND","world","half"],"language":"en"},

A profound drop in the absolute count of blood lymphocytes occurred around 2 weeks post-infection (p.i.) in cats with rapid disease, while the decrease was delayed in the one cat that survived for 6 weeks. The absolute lymphocyte count of the surviving cat remained within normal range. Serum antibodies as measured by indirect immunofluorescence appeared after 2 weeks p.i. and correlated with the onset of disease signs. Viral genomic RNA was either not detectable by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) or detectable only at very low levels in terminal tissues not involved directly in the infection, including hepatic and renal parenchyma, cardiac muscle, lung or popliteal lymph node. High tissue virus loads were measured in severely affected tissues such as the omentum, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen. High levels of viral genomic RNA were also detected in whole ascitic fluid, with the cellular fraction containing 10\u20131000 times more viral RNA than the supernatant. Replicating virus was strongly associated with macrophages by immunohistochemistry. Virus was usually detected at relatively low levels in feces and there was no evidence of enterocyte infection. Viral genomic RNA was not detected at the level of test sensitivity in whole blood, plasma, or the white cell fraction in terminal samples from the 19 cats that succumbed or in the single survivor.

The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy involves the enhanced activation of PPAR transcription factors, including PPAR\u03B1, and to a lesser degree PPAR\u03B2 and PPAR\u03B31. How these transcription factors are regulated in the heart is largely unknown. Recent studies have described post-translational ubiquitination of PPARs as ways in which PPAR activity is inhibited in cancer. However, specific mechanisms in the heart have not previously been described. Recent studies have implicated the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase muscle ring finger-2 (MuRF2) in inhibiting the nuclear transcription factor SRF. Initial studies of MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts revealed enhanced PPAR activity, leading to the hypothesis that MuRF2 regulates PPAR activity by post-translational ubiquitination. METHODS: MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 mice were challenged with a 26-week 60% fat diet designed to simulate obesity-mediated insulin resistance and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mice were followed by conscious echocardiography, blood glucose, tissue triglyceride, glycogen levels, immunoblot analysis of intracellular signaling, heart and skeletal muscle morphometrics, and PPAR\u03B1, PPAR\u03B2, and PPAR\u03B31-regulated mRNA expression. RESULTS: MuRF2 protein levels increase ~20% during the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy induced by high fat diet. Compared to littermate wildtype hearts, MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts exhibit an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterized by an early onset systolic dysfunction, larger left ventricular mass, and higher heart weight. MuRF2\u2212/\u2212 hearts had significantly increased PPAR\u03B1- and PPAR\u03B31-regulated gene expression by RT-qPCR, consistent with MuRF2\u2019s regulation of these transcription factors in vivo. Mechanistically, MuRF2 mono-ubiquitinated PPAR\u03B1 and PPAR\u03B31 in vitro, consistent with its non-degradatory role in diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, increasing MuRF2:PPAR\u03B31 (\u003E5:1) beyond physiological levels drove poly-ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PPAR\u03B31 in vitro, indicating large MuRF2 increases may lead to PPAR degradation if found in other disease states. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in MuRF2 have been described to contribute to the severity of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The present study suggests that the lack of MuRF2, as found in these patients, can result in an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy. These studies also identify MuRF2 as the first ubiquitin ligase to regulate cardiac PPAR\u03B1 and PPAR\u03B31 activities in vivo via post-translational modification without degradation.

We reviewed the surgical and ward activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 5, 2020). The following outcomes were investigated: surgical load, rate of admissions and bed occupation, and the rate and characteristics of unrecognized Covid-positive patients. Data were compared with that of the same period of 2019 (March 11-April 7). Results and Conclusions 63%, 70%, 64%, and 71%, decline in surgery, endoscopy, bed occupation, and admission, respectively, occurred during the 4 weeks after the lockdown, as compared to 2019. Urgent procedures also declined by 32%. Three (8%) of 39 admissions regarded unrecognized Covid-19 overlapping or misinterpreted with urgent urologic conditions such as fever-associated urinary stones or hematuria. In spite of a significant reduction of activity, a non-negligible portion of admissions to our Covid-free unit regarded unrecognized Covid-19.

This study aimed to estimate TB prevalence of the province in 2010 in comparison with the 2000 survey; and to compare yields of TB cases from different case finding approaches. METHODS: A population based, cross-sectional survey was conducted using multi-stage random cluster sampling. 54,279 adults participated in the survey with a response rate of 96%. Doctors interviewed and classified participants as suspected TB cases if they presented with persistent cough, abnormal chest X-ray (CXRAY), or both. Three sputum specimens of all suspected cases were collected and sent for smear microscopy and culture. RESULTS: Adjusted prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 34 per 100,000 for adults in Shandong in 2010. Compared to the 2000 survey, TB prevalence has declined by 80%. 53% of bacteriologically confirmed cases did not present persistent cough. The yield of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 47% by symptom screening and 95% by CXRAY. Over 50% of TB cases were among over 65\u2019s. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases was significantly reduced compared with 2000.

However, the mechanism of NG\u2010induced enhanced HIV\u20101 transmission is unknown. METHODS: (a) The cervical tissues were exposed to NG, and cytokine induction was monitored by measuring cytokine proteins in culture supernatants and cytokine mRNAs in tissues. (b) Transcription and replication of HIV\u20101 in TZM\u2010bl, U1, and ACH2 cells were measured by Beta\u2010Gal activity and p24 proteins in the supernatant, respectively. (c) HIV\u20101 transmission was assayed in an organ culture system by measuring transmitted HIV\u20101 in supernatant and HIV\u20101 gag mRNA in the tissues. (d) Transcriptome analysis was done using second generation sequencing. RESULTS: (a) NG induced membrane ruffling of epithelial layer, caused migration of CD3\u002B cells to the intraepithelial region, and induced high levels of inflammatory cytokines IL\u20101\u03B2 and TNF\u2010\u03B1. (b) NG\u2010induced supernatants (NGIS) increased HIV\u20101 transcription, induced HIV\u20101 from latently infected cells, and increased transmission of HIV\u20101 across cervical mucosa. (c) Transcriptome analysis of the epithelial layer of the tissues exposed to NG, and HIV\u20101 showed significant upregulation of CXCL10 and IL8. IL\u20101\u03B2 increased the induction of CXCL10 and IL\u20108 expression in cervical mucosa with a concomitant increase in HIV\u20101 transmission. CONCLUSION: We present a model in which IL\u20101\u03B2 produced from cervical epithelium during NG exposure increases CXCL10 and IL8 in epithelia. This in turn causes upon HIV\u20101 infection, the migration of HIV\u20101 target cells toward the subepithelium, resulting in increased HIV\u20101 transcription in the sub\u2010mucosa and subsequent enhancement of transmission across cervical mucosa.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanyal, Anwesha; Shen, Chengli; Ding, Ming; Reinhart, Todd A.; Chen, Yue; Sankapal, Soni; Gupta, Phalguni","journal":"Am J Reprod Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39c58dbaa3f69e91698b2efe6d3b12504aa3904d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6540971.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903720/; https://doi.org/10.1111/aji.13111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Neisseria"],"organizations":["NG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced HIV","increased HIV","migration of HIV","increased transmission of HIV","transmitted HIV","enhanced HIV","replication of HIV","sexual transmission of HIV","cervical mucosa","cervical tissues","NG induced membrane","NG exposure","mechanism of NG","induced supernatants","cervical epithelium","Transcription","subsequent enhancement of transmission","cytokine proteins","infected cells","sub\u2010mucosa","cytokine induction","ACH2 cells","target cells","induction of CXCL10","epithelial layer","culture supernatants","cytokine mRNAs","infection","Transcriptome analysis","IL8","significant upregulation of CXCL10","high levels of inflammatory cytokines IL","p24 proteins","migration of CD3","concomitant increase","organ culture system","Beta","intraepithelial region","Gal activity","expression","NGIS","U1","TZM","TNF","Neisseria gonorrhoeae","gag mRNA","subepithelium","PROBLEM","model","generation sequencing","turn","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

All (\u002B)RNA viruses remodel intracellular membranes into unique structures for viral genome replication. Accumulating evidence suggests that picornaviruses from different genera use different strategies to generate viral replication organelles (ROs). For instance, enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, rhinovirus) rely on the Golgi-localized phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III beta (PI4KB), while cardioviruses replicate independently of the kinase. By which mechanisms cardioviruses develop their ROs is currently unknown. Here we show that cardioviruses manipulate another PI4K, namely the ER-localized phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4KA), to generate PI4P-enriched ROs. By siRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacological inhibition, we demonstrate that PI4KA is an essential host factor for EMCV genome replication. We reveal that the EMCV nonstructural protein 3A interacts with and is responsible for PI4KA recruitment to viral ROs. The ensuing phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) proved important for the recruitment of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), which delivers cholesterol to EMCV ROs in a PI4P-dependent manner. PI4P lipids and cholesterol are shown to be required for the global organization of the ROs and for viral genome replication. Consistently, inhibition of OSBP expression or function efficiently blocked EMCV RNA replication. In conclusion, we describe for the first time a cellular pathway involved in the biogenesis of cardiovirus ROs. Remarkably, the same pathway was reported to promote formation of the replication sites of hepatitis C virus, a member of the Flaviviridae family, but not other picornaviruses or flaviviruses. Thus, our results highlight the convergent recruitment by distantly related (\u002B)RNA viruses of a host lipid-modifying pathway underlying formation of viral replication sites.","publish_time":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dorobantu, Cristina M.; Albulescu, Lucian; Harak, Christian; Feng, Qian; van Kampen, Mirjam; Strating, Jeroen R.

The input dataset consists of incident cases partitioned into outbreaks, each initiated from a single index case. We split the input dataset into two successive subsets, to evaluate two successive R values, according to the Bayesian paradigm. We used the Bayes factor between the model with two different R values and that with a single R value to justify that the change in R is statistically significant. We validated our approach using simulated data, generated using known R. In particular, we found that claiming two distinct R values may depend significantly on the number of outbreaks. We then reanalyzed data previously studied by Jansen et al. [Jansen et al. Science 301 (5634), 804], concerning the effective reproduction number for measles in the UK, during 1995\u20132002. Our analyses showed that the 1995\u20132002 dataset should be divided into two separate subsets for the periods 1995\u20131998 and 1999\u20132002. In contrast, Jansen et al. take this splitting point as input of their analysis. Our estimated effective reproduction numbers R are in good agreement with those found by Jansen et al. In conclusion, our methodology for detecting temporal changes in R using outbreak-size data worked satisfactorily with both simulated and real-world data.

The viral genes were found to be AT rich with low CUB. Analysis of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) was used to identify overrepresented and underrepresented codons for each amino acid.

Aim: To evaluate the knowledge Latin American gastroenterologists and endoscopists (staff physicians and residents) have about the characteristics of COVID-19, as well as the prevention measures to be taken during endoscopic procedures. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study that included gastroenterologists and endoscopists from 9 Latin American countries. An electronic questionnaire was applied that was designed to evaluate the knowledge of symptoms, risk groups for severe disease, prevention measures, and the reprocessing of endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. Results: Information was obtained from 133 physicians. Ninety-five percent of them correctly identified the most frequent symptoms of the virus, and 60% identified the 3 risk groups for severe disease. Sixty-six percent of those surveyed did not consider it necessary to use standard precautions during endoscopic procedures, and 30% did not consider contact precautions necessary. Forty-eight percent of the participants surveyed were not familiar with the protocol for reprocessing the endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The majority of the gastroenterologists and endoscopists surveyed were familiar with the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the populations at risk for complications. There was a lack of knowledge about prevention measures (during clinical care and endoscopic procedures) and the reprocessing of endoscopic equipment by 70% and 48%, respectively, of those surveyed.

For detecting or genotyping of FCoV, some RT-PCR plus nested PCR techniques have been reported previously. However, referring to the whole genome sequences (WGSs) registered at NCBI, there are no detection methods that can tolerate the genetic diversity among FCoV population. In addition, the quasispecies nature of FCoV, which consists of heterogeneous variants, has been also demonstrated; thus, a universal method for heteropopulations of FCoV variants in clinical specimens is desirable. RESULTS: To develop an RT-PCR method for detection and genotyping of FCoV, we performed comparative genome analysis using WGSs of 32 FCoV, 7 CCoV and 5 TGEV strains obtained from NCBI. As the PCR target, we focused on the nsp14 coding region, which is highly conserved and phylogenetically informative, and developed a PCR method targeting nsp14 partial sequences. Among 103 ascites, 45 pleural effusion and 214 blood specimens from clinically ill cats, we could detect FCoV in 55 (53.4%), 14 (31.1%) and 19 (8.9%) specimens using the present method. Direct sequencing of PCR products and phylogenetic analysis allowed discrimination between type I- and II-FCoV serotypes. Our nsp14 amino acid sequence typing (nsp14 aa ST) showed that the FCoV clone with sequence type (ST) 42, which was the most predominant genotype of WGS strains, was prevalent in domestic cats in Japan. CONCLUSIONS: Our nsp14 PCR scheme will contribute to virus detection, epidemiology and ecology of FCoV strains.

Based on numerous immune regulatory functions of astrocytes, we evaluated the contribution of astrocyte IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 signaling toward protection against the nonlethal glia- and neuronotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59. Analysis of gene expression associated with IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 function, e.g., pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), revealed lower basal mRNA levels in brain-derived astrocytes than in microglia. Although astrocytes poorly induced Ifn\u03B2 mRNA following infection, they upregulated various mRNAs in the IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 pathway to a higher extent than microglia, supporting effective IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 responsiveness. Ablation of the IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 receptor (IFNAR) in astrocytes using mGFAPcre IFNAR(fl/fl) mice resulted in severe encephalomyelitis and mortality, coincident with uncontrolled virus replication. Further, virus spread was not restricted to astrocytes but also affected microglia and neurons, despite increased and sustained Ifn\u03B1/\u03B2 and ISG mRNA levels within the CNS. IFN-\u03B3, a crucial mediator for MHV control, was not impaired in infected mGFAPcre IFNAR(fl/fl) mice despite reduced T cell CNS infiltration. Unexpectedly however, poor induction of IFN-\u03B3-dependent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression on microglia supported that defective IFN-\u03B3 signaling contributes to uncontrolled virus replication. A link between sustained elevated IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 and impaired responsiveness to IFN-\u03B3 supports the novel concept that temporally limited early IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 responses are critical for effective antiviral IFN-\u03B3 function. Overall, our results imply that IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 signaling in astrocytes is not only critical in limiting early CNS viral spread but also promotes protective antiviral IFN-\u03B3 function. IMPORTANCE An antiviral state established by IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 contains initial viral spread as adaptive immunity develops. While it is apparent that the CNS lacks professional IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 producers and that resident cells have distinct abilities to elicit innate IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 responses, protective interactions between inducer and responder cells require further investigation. Infection with a glia- and neuronotropic coronavirus demonstrates that astrocytes mount a delayed but more robust response to infection than microglia, despite their lower basal mRNA levels of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2-inducing components. Lethal, uncontrolled viral dissemination following ablation of astrocyte IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 signaling revealed the importance of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 responses in a single cell type for protection. Sustained global IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 expression associated with uncontrolled virus did not suffice to protect neurons and further impaired responsiveness to protective IFN-\u03B3. The results support astrocytes as critical contributors to innate immunity and the concept that limited IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 responses are critical for effective subsequent antiviral IFN-\u03B3 function.","publish_time":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Mihyun; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c45cc3b97767ed8a1da4014f453533d6e840a3b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923078.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01901-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29491163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISG","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective IFN-\u03B1","innate IFN-\u03B1","professional IFN-\u03B1","global IFN-\u03B1","importance of IFN","protective IFN-\u03B3","ablation of astrocyte IFN-\u03B1","contribution of astrocyte IFN-\u03B1","\u03B2 function","limited early IFN-\u03B1","sustained elevated IFN-\u03B1","defective IFN-\u03B3","\u03B2 responses","\u03B2 expression","\u03B2 responsiveness","\u03B2 producers","\u03B2 pathway","\u03B2 receptor","protective antiviral IFN-\u03B3 function","effective antiviral IFN-\u03B3 function","poor induction of IFN","effective subsequent antiviral IFN-\u03B3 function","lower basal mRNA levels of IFN","microglia","fl","virus spread","results support astrocytes","uncontrolled virus replication","early CNS viral spread","brain-derived astrocytes","uncontrolled viral dissemination","impaired responsiveness","ISG mRNA levels","initial viral spread","resident cells","protective alpha","protective interactions","critical contributors","antiviral state","viral infections","\u03B3-dependent major histocompatibility complex","numerous immune regulatory functions of astrocytes","neuronotropic mouse hepatitis virus","mice","responder cells","reduced T cell CNS infiltration","induced Ifn\u03B2 mRNA","infected mGFAPcre IFNAR","sustained Ifn\u03B1","neurons","protection","Analysis of gene expression","beta interferon","distinct abilities","novel concept","nonlethal glia","MHV control","neuronotropic coronavirus","adaptive immunity","contribution of distinct central nervous system","interferon-stimulated genes","single cell type","MHC","mortality","inducer","PRRs","class","ISGs","higher extent","severe encephalomyelitis","pattern recognition receptors","crucial mediator","strain A59","robust response","various mRNAs","link","investigation","components"],"language":"en"},

Methods Cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV occurring from October 1, 2012 to May 31, 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Information sources included medical files, infection control outbreak investigations, and the preventive medicine database of MERS-CoV-infected patients. Data were collected on clinical and epidemiological aspects and outcomes. Results Seventy consecutive patients were included. Patients were mostly of older age (median 62 years), male (46, 65.7%), and had healthcare acquisition of infection (39, 55.7%). Fever (43, 61.4%), dyspnea (42, 60%), and cough (38, 54.3%) were the most common symptoms. The majority developed pneumonia (63, 90%) and required intensive care (49, 70%). Infection commonly occurred in clusters. Independent risk factors for severe infection requiring intensive care included concomitant infections (odds ratio (OR) 14.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58\u2013126.09; p =0.018) and low albumin (OR 6.31, 95% CI 1.24\u201331.90; p =0.026).

Results from a phylogenetic analysis indicate continuous evolutionary topology in H3N2 isolates, and two distinct H1N1 lineages. Many genetic relationships between vaccine strains and epidemic isolates appearing in Taiwan before other global locations were also observed and recorded in addition to a gradual increase in the number of N\u2010linked glycosylation sites on partial HA1 proteins since 1980. The results from pairwise comparisons of HA1 nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences indicate shared identities within groups organized according to their bootstrap and P\u2010values of approximately 95.5\u2013100% and 95.7\u2013100% in H1N1 and 94.5\u2013100% and 93.2\u2013100% in H3N2 viruses, respectively.

Computer folding of the 3\u2032 NTR sequence predicted three stem-loop structures (SL1, SL2, and SL3 in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction), which generally were supported by solution structure analyses. The importance of these sequence and/or structural elements to PVX RNA accumulation was further analyzed by inoculation of Nicotiana tabacum (NT-1) protoplasts with PVX transcripts containing mutations in the 3\u2032 NTR. Analyses of RNA accumulation by S1 nuclease protection indicated that multiple sequence elements throughout the 3\u2032 NTR were important for minus-strand RNA accumulation. Formation of SL3 was required for accumulation of minus-strand RNA, whereas SL1 and SL2 formation were less important. However, sequences within all of these predicted structures were required for minus-strand RNA accumulation, including a conserved hexanucleotide sequence element in the loop of SL3, and the CU nucleotide in a U-rich sequence within SL2. In contrast, 13 nucleotides that were predicted to reside in SL1 could be deleted without any significant reduction in minus or plus-strand RNA levels. Potential polyadenylation signals (near upstream elements; NUEs) in the 3\u2032 NTR of PVX RNA were more important for plus-strand RNA accumulation than for minus-strand RNA accumulation. In addition, one of these NUEs overlapped with other sequence required for optimal minus-strand RNA levels. These data indicate that the PVX 3\u2032 NTR contains multiple, overlapping elements that influence accumulation of both minus and plus-strand RNA.","publish_time":"2003-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pillai-Nair, Neeta; Kim, Kook-Hyung; Hemenway, Cynthia","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be50be9fe37a15ce24c1530cb2097b803dcde390.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126608.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283602013694; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283602013694","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PVX","NTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["minus-strand RNA accumulation","PVX RNA accumulation","NTR of PVX RNA","accumulation of minus","Analyses of RNA accumulation","NTR sequence","optimal minus-strand RNA levels","multiple sequence elements","PVX transcripts","SL1","U-rich sequence","sequenced PVX strains","upstream elements","structural elements","conserved hexanucleotide sequence element","loop of SL3","SL2 formation","Formation of SL3","predicted structures","sequences","NUEs","stem-loop structures","solution structure analyses","S1 nuclease protection","potato virus X","CU nucleotide","protoplasts","non-translated region","Potential polyadenylation signals","inoculation of Nicotiana tabacum","mutations","significant reduction","contrast","nucleotides","potexviruses","addition","data","Computer","importance","direction"],"language":"en"},

China has been promoting the Belt and Road Initiative and South-South Cooperation and has made significant contributions to the prosperity of human beings. Along with the opportunities that globalization brought about such as the World Health Organization and the boom in the economy, global health challenges also emerged. This resulted in certain obstacles for China when it sought to advocate the Belt and Road Initiative and when it attempted to carry out its strategy to address global health issues. What are the emerging challenges for global health? What can China do for global health? Why does global health need China? We tried to address these questions as China\u0027s global engagement continues to expand in the new era. This article makes the case for Chinese approaches, including getting involved in public health, being consistent in addressing local conditions, sharing China\u0027s experience with handling health services, and strengthening government-led action while being guided by relative policies. China has a lot to offer in the promotion of global health and in overcoming the challenges and risks that this goal currently faces. Thus, China should be considered an inseparable part of global health governance and bilateral health development cooperation.","publish_time":"2019-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Yang; Cheng, Feng","journal":"Global health journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18c80b3457039c28604e34ac230c579235d1ee2e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2414644719302702; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.glohj.2019.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292832/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2414644719302702","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United Nations Sustainable Development Goals","World Health Organization","Belt and Road Initiative"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["global health challenges","global health governance","promotion of global health","global health issues","global health need China","public health","global governance","handling health services","World Health Organization","China\u0027s global engagement","bilateral health development cooperation","South-South Cooperation","China\u0027s experience","Road Initiative","emerging challenges","Belt","Abstract China\u0027s participation","United Nations Sustainable Development Goals","boom","significant contributions","local conditions","economy","government","community of shared future","prosperity of human beings","Chinese approaches","action","case","article","mankind","questions","strategy","guiding principle","relative policies","globalization","risks","certain obstacles","lot","new era","opportunities"],"language":"en"},

We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients during Dec 20, 2019 and Feb 25, 2020 in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes. METHODS: All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center, retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS: We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men and average age was 51 years). 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan related history of travel or contact. The majority took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds. 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures. 4 upper airway infection were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the 4(th) recovered and was not tested). All cases were mild and successfully recovered after proper treatment. Laboratory results of 47 HTx cases within the last 2 months were extracted. 21.3% recipients had pre-existing lymphopenia and 87.2% of recipients had therapeutic tacrolimus concentration (5-12ng/ml). 5 and 6 recipients had liver and kidney insufficiency respectively. CONCLUSION: HTx recipients that practiced appropriate prevention measures had a low rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and transition to COVID-19. These early data will require confirmation as the pandemic establishes around the world.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Zong-Li; Hu, Rui; Wang, Zhi-Wei; Zhang, Min; Ruan, Yong-Le; Wu, Zhi-Yong; Wu, Hong-Bing; Hu, Xiao-Ping; Hu, Zhi-Peng; Ren, Wei; Li, Luo-Cheng; Dai, Fei-Feng; Liu, Huan; Cai, Xin","journal":"J Heart Lung Transplant","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102567.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362392/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["characteristics of HTx recipients","accessible HTx recipients","HTx cases","SARS-CoV","contact","appropriate prevention measures","precautionary measures","Laboratory results","low rate of infection","upper airway infection","clinical characteristics of heart transplant","Wuhan related history of travel","web-based questionnaire","communities","single-center","therapeutic tacrolimus concentration","quarantine procedures","suspicious crowds","pandemic","confirmation","retrospective study","average age","years","families","BACKGROUND","majority","liver","kidney insufficiency","transition","epidemic","METHODS","CONCLUSION","early data","hospital database","effort","risk","outcomes","proper treatment","COVID","information","months","Hubei","lymphopenia","world"],"language":"en"},

Type B3 coxsackievirus (CVB3), a non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus of the Enterovirus genus, is one of most common agent of viral myocarditis. Till now, effective treatments for VMC are lacking due to lack of drugs or vaccine. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is applied in the clinical management of manic depressive disorders. Accumulating evidence have demonstrated that LiCl, also as an effective antiviral drug, exhibited antiviral effects for specific viruses. However, there are few reports of evaluating LiCl\u2019s antiviral effect in mice model. Here, we investigated the inhibitory influence of LiCl on the CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo and the development of CVB3-induced VMC. We found that LiCl significantly suppressed CVB3 replication in HeLa via inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment in vivo obviously inhibited virus replication within the myocardium and alleviated CVB3-induced acute myocarditis. Collectively, our data demonstrated that LiCl inhibited CVB3 replication and negatively regulated virus-triggered inflammatory responses. Our finding further expands the antiviral targets of LiCl and provides an alternative agent for viral myocarditis.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Yinxia; Yan, Kepeng; Wang, Yanqi; Cai, Jiamin; Wei, Lin; Li, Shuijun; Xu, Wei; Li, Min","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84b5baf8db08e8561ab8fb7dce587e42910975a9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bdd03b4ce6ce389d6e09f3efe991ba21a9f0a493.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102605.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32205210/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401020304563; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401020304563","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LiCl inhibited CVB3 replication","antiviral targets of LiCl","LiCl treatment","suppressed CVB3 replication","alleviated CVB3","development of CVB3","inhibited virus replication","inhibitory influence of LiCl","induced VMC","common agent of viral myocarditis","regulated virus","antiviral effects","viral infection","acute myocarditis","effective antiviral drug","inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis","LiCl\u2019s antiviral effect","non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus","type of inflammation","alternative agent","effective treatments","Type B3 coxsackievirus","HeLa","myocardium","myocardial cells","important cause of dilated cardiomyopathy","Enterovirus genus","clinical management of manic depressive disorders","DCM","mice model","data","specific viruses","reports","inflammatory responses","lack of drugs","vaccine","finding","Lithium chloride","Accumulating evidence"],"language":"en"},

However, limited information is available for risk stratification in PIV-infected patients with hematologic malignancy with or without HCT. Patients with hematologic malignancy diagnosed with PIV from January 2009 to December 2018 were retrospectively included in a tertiary care hospital in Seoul, South Korea. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was defined as the detection of PIV in a nasopharyngeal sample with URTI symptoms without new pulmonary infiltrates. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was defined as detection of PIV in either upper or lower respiratory tract samples with new pulmonary infiltrates, with or without hypoxia. PIV-associated mortality was defined as death with respiratory failure and persistent LRTI within 90 days after diagnosis. The study included 143 adult patients. Of these, 55 (38%) progressed to or initially presented with LRTI. Among these, 22 (40%) died from PIV-associated mortality. An immunodeficiency risk score was developed from associated risk factors using a multivariable Cox regression model. Patients were stratified into low (0\u20132), moderate (3\u20135), and high risk (6\u20138) groups with PIV-associated mortalities of 0%, 9%, and 67%, respectively (p \u003C 0.005, Harrell\u2019s C-index = 0.84). PIV infection can result in substantial mortality in patients with hematologic malignancy if it progresses to LRTI.

All patients scored positive for the hemophagocytosis score (HScore) and were diagnosed with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH) characterized by pancytopenia, hyper-coagulation, acute kidney injury and hepatobiliary dysfunction. At the end-of-treatment, ICU patients had less need for vasopressors, significantly improved respiratory function and lower HScore. Although three patients died, the mortality was lower than historical series of patients with sHLH in sepsis. These data suggest that administration of Anakinra may be beneficial for treating severe COVID-19 patients with sHLH as determined by the HScore and support the need for larger clinical studies to validate this concept.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dimopoulos, George; de Mast, Quirijn; Markou, Nikolaos; Theodorakopoulou, Maria; Komnos, Apostolos; Mouktaroudi, Maria; Netea, Mihai G.; Spyridopoulos, Themistoklis; Verheggen, Rebecca J.; Hoogerwerf, Jacobien; Lachana, Alexandra; van de Veerdonk, Frank L.; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J.","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c471590ba91d0a0a50fc0239f131221276918ae3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411313/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312820302894; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.05.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312820302894?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Anakinra"],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Greece"],"keyphrases":["ICU patients","pneumonia patients","sHLH","severe COVID","historical series of patients","lower HScore","severe complications of COVID","need","treatment","administration of Anakinra","non-ICU patient","receptor antagonist Anakinra","acute kidney injury","ICUs","hyper-coagulation","Greece","pancytopenia","intensive care units","vasopressors","hepatobiliary dysfunction","respiratory function","larger clinical studies","interleukin","Netherlands","crucial role","mortality","hemophagocytosis score","secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis","concept","sepsis","SUMMARY Dysregulation of inflammation","pathway","data","end"],"language":"en"},

For many diseases, Syrian golden hamsters have emerged as an ideal animal model due to their low cost, small size, ease of handling, and ability to accurately reflect disease progression in humans. Despite the increasing use and popularity of hamsters, there remains a lack of available reagents for studying hamster immune responses. Without suitable reagents for assessing immune responses, researchers are left to examine clinical signs and disease pathology. This becomes an issue for the development of vaccine and treatment options where characterizing the type of immune response generated is critical for understanding protection from disease. Despite the relative lack of reagents for use in hamsters, significant advances have been made recently with several hamster specific immunologic methods being developed.

We outline what methods are currently available for use in hamsters and what is readily used as well as what limitations still exist and future perspectives of reagent and assay development for hamsters.

In early-stage cervical cancer, postponing hysterectomy for 6\u20138 weeks is suggested as a possible option in the Covid-19 burdened hospitals. Yet, literature examining the impact of surgery wait-time on survival in early-stage cervical cancer remains scarce. This study examined the association between surgery wait-time of 8 weeks and oncologic outcome in women with early-stage cervical cancer. Methods This is a single institution retrospective observational study at a tertiary referral medical center examining women who underwent primary hysterectomy or trachelectomy for clinical stage IA-IIA invasive cervical cancer between 2000 and 2017 (N = 217). Wait-time from the diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer via biopsy to definitive surgery was categorized as: short wait-time (\u003C8 weeks; n = 110) versus long wait-time (\u22658 weeks; n = 107). Propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the measured demographics between the two groups, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was performed. Results In a weighted model (median follow-up, 4.6 years), women in the long wait-time group had DFS (4.5-year rates, 91.2% versus 90.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47\u20132.59, P = 0.818) and OS (95.0% versus 97.4%, HR 1.47, 95%CI 0.50\u20134.31, P = 0.487) similar to those in the short wait-time group. Three studies were examined for meta-analysis (median, n = 217), and a pooled HR for surgery wait-time of \u22658 weeks on DFS was 0.96 (95%CI 0.59\u20131.55). Conclusion Our study suggests that wait-time of 8 weeks for hysterectomy may not be associated with short-term disease recurrence in women with early-stage cervical cancer.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matsuo, Koji; Novatt, Hilary; Matsuzaki, Shinya; Hom, Marianne S.; Castaneda, Antonio V.; Licon, Ernesto; Nusbaum, David J.; Roman, Lynda D.","journal":"Gynecologic oncology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84beb27a55bda4bef5be931209dfadbb39bf9ef7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090825820310878?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425268/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.05.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090825820310878","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DFS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weeks","early-stage cervical cancer","long wait-time group","short wait-time group","women","diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer","cancer patients","clinical stage IA-IIA invasive cervical cancer","DFS","definitive surgery","impact of surgery","primary hysterectomy","postponing hysterectomy","overall survival","disease-free survival","meta-analysis","Covid","pooled HR","median follow-up","single institution retrospective observational study","systematic literature review","tertiary referral medical center","trachelectomy","biopsy","Propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting","oncologic outcome","global pandemic","timely care","groups","years","weighted model","short-term disease recurrence","novel coronavirus","unique challenges","confidence interval","possible option","Abstract Objective","Methods","Results","association","measured demographics","burdened hospitals","hazard ratio","year rates","studies","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients appears to be higher especially as they are more likely to present with an immunocompromised condition, either from the cancer itself or from the treatments they receive. A major consideration in the delivery of cancer care during the pandemic is to balance the risk of patient exposure and infection with the need to provide effective cancer treatment. Many aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly characterized currently and even less is known about the course of infection in the context of a patient with cancer. As SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, the risk of infection directly affects the cancer patient being treated, other cancer patients in close proximity, and health care providers. Infection at any level for patients or providers can cause significant disruption to even the most effective treatment plans. Lung cancer patients, especially those with reduced lung function and cardiopulmonary co-morbidities are more likely to have increased risk and mortality from COVID-19 as one of its common manifestation is as an acute respiratory illness. The purpose of this manuscript is to present a practical multidisciplinary and international overview to assist in treatment for lung cancer patients during this pandemic, with the caveat that evidence is lacking in many areas. It is expected that firmer recommendations can be developed as more evidence becomes available.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dingemans, Anne-Marie C.; Soo, Ross A.; Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Rice, Shawn J.; Kim, Young Tae; Teo, Lynette LS.; Warren, Graham W.; Xiao, Shu-Yuan; Smit, Egbert F.; Aerts, Joachim G.; Yoon, Soon Ho; Veronesi, Giulia; De Cobelli, Francesco; Ramalingam, Suresh S.; Garassino, Marina C.; Wynes, Murry W.; Behera, Madhusmita; Haanen, John; Lu, Shun; Peters, Solange; Ahn, Myung-Ju; Scagliotti, Giorgio V.; Adjei, Alex A.; Belani, Chandra P.","journal":"J. thorac. oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0baffdf3900302d1a91c63f7a634fff20b34e302.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1556086420303828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422364/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.05.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1556086420303828?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lung cancer patients","risk of infection","effective cancer treatment","delivery of cancer care","course of infection","risk of SARS","pandemic","SARS-CoV","risk of patient exposure","increased risk","effective treatment plans","evidence","reduced lung function","health care providers","significant disruption","significant challenges","global COVID","cardiopulmonary co-morbidities","close proximity","need","medical facilities","international overview","rapid pace","mortality","context","acute respiratory illness","common manifestation","major consideration","manuscript","immunocompromised condition","level","caveat","aspects","firmer recommendations","purpose","areas","treatments"],"language":"en"},

CoV trigger a drastic reorganization of host cell membranes to promote their replication and egression, but a detailed description of the intracellular remodeling induced by PEDV is still missing. In this study, we examined qualitatively and quantitatively, using electron microscopy, the intracellular membrane reorganization induced by PEDV over the course of an infection. With our ultrastructural approach, we reveal that, as most of CoV, PEDV initially forms double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which probably serve as replication/transcription platforms. Interestingly, we also found that viral particles start to form almost simultaneously in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the large virion-containing vacuoles (LVCVs), which are compartments originating from the Golgi, confirming that \u03B1-CoV assemble indistinguishably in two different organelles of the secretory pathway. Moreover, PEDV virons appear to have an immature and a mature form, similar to another \u03B1-CoV the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). Altogether, our study underlies the similarities and differences between the lifecycle of \u03B1-CoV and that of viruses belonging to other CoV subfamilies.","publish_time":"2017-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Xingdong; Cong, Yingying; Veenendaal, Tineke; Klumperman, Judith; Shi, Dongfang; Mari, Muriel; Reggiori, Fulvio","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96759aa0dce56dd50709ab124ae0255e0cad79d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5618017.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28872588/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v9090251","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV subfamilies","\u03B1-CoV genus","PEDV virons","lifecycle of \u03B1","intracellular membrane reorganization","replication","study","convoluted membranes","intracellular remodeling","mature form","drastic reorganization of host cell membranes","double-membrane vesicles","transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","DMVs","high mortality","infected sucking piglets","substantial losses","large virion","detailed description","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","LVCVs","egression","different organelles","differences","electron microscopy","TGEV","viruses","secretory pathway","endoplasmic reticulum","vacuoles","farming industry","similarities","CMs","course","Golgi","compartments","transcription platforms","infection","ultrastructural approach","viral particles"],"language":"en"},

This cross-sectional study was conducted based on antibody-ELISA of bulk tank milk (BTM) from 1347 herds in two neighboring counties in western Norway. The study aims were to determine the seroprevalence at herd level, to evaluate risk factors for BRSV and BCoV seropositivity, and to assess how these factors were associated with the spatial distribution of positive herds. The overall prevalence of BRSV and BCoV positive herds in the region was 46.2% and 72.2%, respectively. Isopleth maps of the prevalence risk distribution showed large differences in prevalence risk across the study area, with the highest prevalence in the northern region. Common risk factors of importance for both viruses were herd size, geographic location, and proximity to neighbors. Seropositivity for one virus was associated with increased odds of seropositivity for the other virus. Purchase of livestock was an additional risk factor for BCoV seropositivity, included in the model as in-degree, which was defined as the number of incoming movements from individual herds, through animal purchase, over a period of five years. Local dependence and the contribution of risk factors to this effect were assessed using the residuals from two logistic regression models for each virus. One model contained only the x- and y- coordinates as predictors, the other had all significant predictors included. Spatial clusters of high values of residuals were detected using the normal model of the spatial scan statistic and visualized on maps. Adjusting for the risk factors in the final models had different impact on the spatial clusters for the two viruses: For BRSV the number of clusters was reduced from six to four, for BCoV the number of clusters remained the same, however the log-likelihood ratios changed notably. This indicates that geographical differences in proximity to neighbors, herd size and animal movements explain some of the spatial clusters of BRSV- and BCoV seropositivity, but far from all. The remaining local dependence in the residuals show that the antibody status of one herd is influenced by the antibody status of its neighbors, indicating the importance of indirect transmission and that increased biosecurity routines might be an important preventive strategy.","publish_time":"2016-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toftaker, Ingrid; Sanchez, Javier; Stokstad, Maria; N\u00F8dtvedt, Ane","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebc824ac4eef0e9f30adc378211f28f77e9fe5d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114080.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587716303233; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.09.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587716303233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27720029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV"],"locations":["Norway"],"keyphrases":["BCoV seropositivity","spatial clusters of BRSV","prevalence risk distribution","contribution of risk factors","BCoV positive herds","number of clusters","Common risk factors of importance","overall prevalence of BRSV","spatial distribution of positive herds","additional risk factor","herd size","neighbors","Spatial clusters of high values of residuals","increased odds of seropositivity","highest prevalence","individual herds","herd level","antibody status","spatial scan statistic","viruses","animal movements","proximity","antibody-ELISA","animal purchase","number of incoming movements","study area","normal model","study aims","cross-sectional study","Abstract Bovine respiratory syncytial virus","remaining local dependence","large differences","final models","bovine coronavirus","geographical differences","Purchase of livestock","Isopleth maps","western Norway","northern region","significant predictors","increased biosecurity routines","importance of indirect transmission","logistic regression models","geographic location","bulk tank milk","different impact","BTM","important preventive strategy","neighboring counties","seroprevalence","effect","y- coordinates","period","cattle","log-likelihood ratios","years","degree"],"language":"en"},

The open reading frame (ORF) of black carp TRAF3 (bcTRAF3) consists of 1722 nucleotides and bcTRAF3 contains 574 amino acids. bcTRAF3 protein migrated around 65 KDa in immunoblot analysis of both EPC and HEK293T cells. bcTRAF3 was identified as a cytosolic protein and suggested to form aggregates or be associated with vesicles scattering in the cytoplasm. It was interesting that both NF-\u03BAB and IFN transcription was activated by bcTRAF3 in reporter assay. When co-expressed with black carp STING (bcSTING), bcTRAF3 was redistributed in the cytoplasm and its subcellular location overlapped with that of bcSTING no matter what the cells was infected with GCRV or not, which suggested the association between these two molecules. bcSTING-mediated IFN production was up-regulated by bcTRAF3 in a dose dependent manner in reporter assay. Accordingly, EPC cells transfected with both bcSTING and bcTRAF3 showed enhanced antiviral activity comparing EPC cells expressing bcSTING alone.

This review focuses on the interactions of two enveloped RNA viruses\u2014porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SwIV)\u2014as major etiological agents that contribute to PRDC within the porcine cellular innate immunity during infection. The innate immune system of the porcine lung includes alveolar and parenchymal/interstitial macrophages, neutrophils (PMN), conventional dendritic cells (DC) and plasmacytoid DC, natural killer cells, and \u03B3\u03B4 T cells, thus the in vitro and in vivo interactions between those cells and PRRSV and SwIV are reviewed. Likewise, the few studies regarding PRRSV-SwIV co-infection are illustrated together with the different modulation mechanisms that are induced by the two viruses. Alterations in responses by natural killer (NK), PMN, or \u03B3\u03B4 T cells have not received much attention within the scientific community as their counterpart antigen-presenting cells and there are numerous gaps in the knowledge regarding the role of those cells in both infections.

Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged by matters concerning - but not limited to - organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity. The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2. This report details the nationwide response of the Dutch transplant community to these issues and the immediate consequences for transplant activity. Worrisome, there was a significant decrease in organ donation numbers affecting all organ transplant services. In addition, there was a detrimental effect on transplantation numbers in children with end-organ failure. Ongoing efforts focus on mitigation of not only primary but also secondary harm of the pandemic and to find right definitions and momentum to restore the transplant programs.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Vries, A.P.J.; Alwayn, I.P.J.; Hoek, R.A.S.; van den Berg, A.P.; Ultee, F.C.W.; Vogelaar, S.M.; Haase-Kromwijk, B.J.J.M.; Heemskerk, M.B.A.; Hemke, A.C.; Nijboer, W.N.; Schaefer, B.S.; Kuiper, M.A.; de Jonge, J.; van der Kaaij, N.P.; Reinders, M.E.J.","journal":"Transpl Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/220174ac0a9a107a0013fc4abde3523f15accdc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194049.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371150/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trim.2020.101304; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966327420300782?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966327420300782","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["organ transplant services","transplant recipients","delivery of transplant care","transplant patients","transplant activity","transplant programs","COVID","year history of organ transplantation","Dutch transplant community","transplantation numbers","organ procurement","organ donation numbers","end-organ failure","postponing transplantation","end-stage organ disease","entrenched health care resources","prioritization of health care services","capacity issues","Children","risk of SARS","pandemic","medical consequences of SARS","attributable risk of immunosuppression","year survival rates","detrimental outcome","detrimental effect","initiating immunosuppression","immediate consequences","allocation of resources","young adults","screening strategies of donors","transmission","significant decrease","nationwide response","unparalleled obstacle","associated waitlist mortality","momentum","decisions","concerns","right definitions","mitigation","secondary harm","evils","rapid emergence","Ongoing efforts","report","addition","matters"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A case-based presentation is used to illustrate the potential limitations of rapid antigen detection assays for influenza. Results: Influenza is a seasonal illness; estimates attribute influenza to approximately 200,000 hospitalizations and 41,000 deaths in the United States annually. Antigen detection assays for influenza are rapid and convenient, and thus are widely used in a variety of health care settings, even though the sensitivity of these assays may be suboptimal. The United States Food and Drug Administration has recently created new guidelines intended to improve the oversight and performance characteristics of influenza antigen detection assays. Molecular assays, although more costly and complex, are more sensitive and may be designed to simultaneously detect multiple respiratory pathogens within a single assay. Conclusions: Diagnostic assays for influenza can vary greatly with regards to analytical performance characteristics, complexity, turnaround time and cost. This can have important patient care and infection prevention implications.","publish_time":"2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"McMullen, Allison R.; Anderson, Neil W.; Burnham, Carey-Ann D.","journal":"Am J Clin Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93159181076f504c12b85fee6ac6b8c388847637.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110119.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27124947/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqw039","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States Food and Drug Administration"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["performance characteristics of influenza antigen detection assays","Diagnostic assays","Molecular assays","attribute influenza","potential limitations of rapid antigen detection assays","nucleic acid detection assays","available influenza diagnostics","analytical performance characteristics","United States Food","important patient care","variety of health care settings","complexity","focus","Drug Administration","oversight","turnaround time","infection prevention implications","regards","seasonal illness","multiple respiratory pathogens","single assay","new guidelines","hospitalizations","strengths","sensitivity","case-based presentation","Methods","cost","deaths","Results","Conclusions","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

To determine the in vivo effects of IFN-\u03B3 on SINV clearance and T cell responses, C57BL/6 mice lacking IFN-\u03B3 or IFN-\u03B3 receptor-1 were compared to wild-type (WT) mice after intracranial SINV infection. In WT mice, IFN-\u03B3 was first produced in the CNS by natural killer cells and then by CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells. Mice with impaired IFN-\u03B3 signaling initiated clearance of viral RNA earlier than WT mice associated with CNS entry of more granzyme B-producing CD8(\u002B) T cells. However, these mice established fewer CD8(\u002B) tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells and were more likely to experience reactivation of viral RNA synthesis late after infection. Therefore, IFN-\u03B3 suppresses the local development of granzyme B-expressing CD8(\u002B) T cells and slows viral RNA clearance but promotes CD8(\u002B) T(RM) cell establishment.","publish_time":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baxter, Victoria K.; Griffin, Diane E.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f51b986600acc015fa48820a1ec11c90ea871d6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7019780.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12010113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31963302/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","impaired IFN-\u03B3","IFN-\u03B3 receptor","Infection of mice","WT mice","effects of IFN","SINV clearance","T cell responses","viral RNA clearance","intracranial SINV infection","fewer CD8","initiated clearance of viral RNA","alphavirus infection","tissue-resident memory T","natural killer cells","reactivation of viral RNA synthesis","RM","CNS entry","SINV-infected differentiated neurons","local development of granzyme B","Sindbis virus","cell establishment","immune response","suppression of virus replication","C57BL","induction of antiviral genes","central nervous system","role","wild-type","CD4","important component","model","Interferon-gamma"],"language":"en"},

Small intestinal bacterial contamination and tropical enteropathy could trigger inflammatory stimuli and activate the endothelium in the portal venous system. Groundwater contaminated with arsenic is an environmental factor of epidemic proportions in large areas of India which has similar consequences. Von Willebrand factor (a sticky protein) expressed by activated endothelium may promote formation of platelet microthrombi and occlusion of intrahepatic portal vein branches leading to NCIPH. Environmental factors linked to suboptimal hygiene and sanitation, which enter through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, predispose to platelet plugging onto activated endothelium in portal microcirculation. Thus, NCIPH, an example of poverty linked thrombophilia, is a disease mainly affecting the lower socio-economic strata of Indian population. Public health measures to improve sanitation, provide clean drinking water and eliminate arsenic contamination of drinking water are urgently needed. Till such time as these environmental factors are addressed, NCIPH is likely to remain \u0027an Indian disease\u0027.","publish_time":"2019-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goel, Ashish; Ramakrishna, Banumathi; Zachariah, Uday; Sajith, K.G.; Burad, Deepak K.; Kodiatte, Thomas A.; Keshava, Shyamkumar N.; Balasubramanian, K.A.; Elias, Elwyn; Eapen, C.E.","journal":"Indian J Med Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6676844.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411170/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_1405_17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Von Willebrand"],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["NCIPH","portal microcirculation","Environmental factors","activated endothelium","sanitation","arsenic contamination of drinking water","portal venous system","Indian disease","occlusion of intrahepatic portal vein branches","environmental factor of epidemic proportions","majority of non-cirrhotic intrahepatic portal hypertension","clean drinking water","tropical enteropathy","unexplained enteropathy","Willebrand factor","large areas of India","formation of platelet microthrombi","Small intestinal bacterial contamination","lower socio-economic strata of Indian population","inflammatory stimuli","sticky protein","suboptimal hygiene","patients","similar consequences","example of poverty","Public health measures","thrombophilia","tract","time","Groundwater"],"language":"en"},

The recently characterized E protein ion channel activity (EIC) has also been implicated in modulating viral pathogenesis. In this study, we used infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) as a model to study EIC. Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring EIC-inactivating mutations \u2013 rT16A and rA26F \u2013 were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Two rIBVs harboring these putative EIC-reverting mutations \u2013 rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N \u2013 were recovered. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65 control, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular RNA synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. Our results showed that the IBV EIC contributed to the induction of ER stress response, as up-regulation of ER stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants. EIC-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. Significantly, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative EIC revertants. EIC mutations were also implicated in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and viral pathogenicity in vivo. Taken together, this study highlights the importance of CoV EIC in modulating virion release and various aspects of CoV \u2013 host interaction.","publish_time":"2020-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shumin; Yuan, Lixia; Dai, Guo; Chen, Rui Ai; Liu, Ding Xiang; Fung, To Sing","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7b122d6d4cc409f7a22bec63936640b4cd0f334.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6992538.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.03022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32038520/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EIC","TMD","IBV EIC","ER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EIC mutations","EIC mutants","IBV EIC","study EIC","EIC-defective mutants","EIC-inactivating mutations","importance of CoV EIC","putative EIC revertants","putative EIC-reverting mutations","compensatory mutations","structural protein production","modulating virion release","small structural protein critical","virion morphogenesis","virion assembly","rT16A","cells","rIBVs","viral pathogenicity","modulating viral pathogenesis","rA26F","defective phenotypes","lower levels of viral fitness","induction of ER stress response","characterized E protein ion channel activity","various aspects of CoV","IBV-induced apoptosis","infectious bronchitis coronavirus","culture supernatant","cell culture","infectious virions","regulation of ER stress-related genes","induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines","comparable levels of intracellular RNA synthesis","A26V","smaller plaques","host interaction","parental rIBV-p65 control","envelope","model","transmembrane domain","F14N","recombinant IBVs","TMD","results"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, LRNV harbored by Rattus norvegicus formed a distinct lineage within the genus Alphacoronavirus in the 3CLpro, RdRp, and Hel gene trees, but formed a more divergent lineage in the N and S gene trees, indicative of a recombinant origin.

In this study, we demonstrate that a serine residue in IRF3 is positively selected for in multiple bat species. IRF3 is a central regulator of innate antiviral responses in mammals. Replacing the serine residue in bat IRF3 with the human leucine residue decreased antiviral protection in bat cells, whereas the addition of this serine residue in human IRF3 significantly enhanced antiviral protection in human cells.

DC-SIGNR is a C-type lectin that is frequently found on human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. LSECtin, which is a homologue of DC-SIGNR, has been demonstrated to participate in colon cancer liver metastasis. Due to the similarities in the expression pattern and structure of the two proteins, we speculated that DC-SIGNR could also be involved in this process. METHODS: Colon cancer cells were treated with the DC-SIGNR protein or control IgG, after which cell migration, invasion, and morphology were assayed. Xenograft mouse models were used to determine the role of DC-SIGNR in colon cancer liver metastasis in vivo. In addition, a human gene expression array was used to detect differential gene expression in colon cancer cells stimulated with the DC-SIGNR protein. The serum level of DC-SIGNR was examined in colon cancer patients by ELISA, and the significance of DC-SIGNR was determined. RESULTS: In our research, we investigated whether DC-SIGNR promotes colon cancer cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Knocking down mouse DC-SIGNR decreased the liver metastatic potency of colon cancer cells and increased survival time. Expressing human DC-SIGNR enhanced colon cancer liver metastasis. Furthermore, DC-SIGNR conferred metastatic capability on cancer cells by upregulating various metallothionein isoforms. To validate the above results, we also found that the serum DC-SIGNR level was statistically higher in colon cancer patients with liver metastasis compared with those without metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that DC-SIGNR may promote colon carcinoma hepatic metastasis and could serve as a promising therapeutic target for anticancer treatment.

Airborne E. coli were isolated from indoor air, upwind air (10 and 50m away) and downwind air samples (10, 50, 100, 200 and 400m away) for five swine houses using six-stage Andersen microbial samplers and Reuter-Centrifugal samplers (RCS). E. coli strains from pig fecal samples were also collected simultaneously. The enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerize chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) and the repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP-PCR) approaches were used to study the genetic variability and to determine the strain relationships among E. coli isolated from different sites in each swine house. Results showed that 35.1% (20/57) of the bacterial DNA fingerprints from the fecal isolates matched with the corresponding strains isolated from indoor and downwind air samples (similarity \u2A7E90%). E. coli strains from the indoor and downwind air samples were closely related to the E. coli strains isolated from feces, while those isolated from upwind air samples (swine house C) had low similarity (61\u201369%).

Using the prototype species equine torovirus (EToV) we performed parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to analyse the relative expression levels of the known torovirus proteins and transcripts, chimaeric sequences produced via discontinuous RNA synthesis (a characteristic of the nidovirus replication cycle) and changes in host transcription and translation as a result of EToV infection. RNA sequencing confirmed that EToV utilises a unique combination of discontinuous and non-discontinuous RNA synthesis to produce its subgenomic RNAs; indeed, we identified transcripts arising from both mechanisms that would result in sgRNAs encoding the nucleocapsid. Our ribosome profiling analysis revealed that ribosomes efficiently translate two novel CUG-initiated ORFs, located within the so-called 5\u2019 UTR. We have termed the resulting proteins U1 and U2. Comparative genomic analysis confirmed that these ORFs are conserved across all available torovirus sequences and the inferred amino acid sequences are subject to purifying selection, indicating that U1 and U2 are functionally relevant. This study provides the first high-resolution analysis of transcription and translation in this neglected group of livestock pathogens. Toroviruses infect cattle, goats, pigs and horses worldwide and can cause gastrointestinal disease. There is no treatment or vaccine and their ability to spill over into humans has not been assessed. These viruses are related to important human pathogens including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and they share some common features, however the mechanism that they use to produce subgenomic RNA molecules differs. Here we performed deep sequencing to determine how equine torovirus produces subgenomic RNAs. In doing so, we also identified two previously unknown open reading frames \u201Chidden\u201D within the genome. Together these results highlight the similarities and differences between this domestic animal virus and related pathogens of humans and livestock.","publish_time":"2018-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stewart, Hazel; Brown, Katherine; Dinan, Adam M.; Irigoyen, Nerea; Snijder, Eric J.; Firth, Andrew E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5e1d36298a78690140d5ccb9673dbd48a0ddcd3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a3816ce68ae5fec1523c4a7f7613fee85fc39a31.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/296996","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","U2"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA-seq","parallel RNA sequencing","subgenomic RNA molecules","available torovirus sequences","genus Torovirus","non-discontinuous RNA synthesis","known torovirus proteins","prototype species equine torovirus","subgenomic RNAs","related pathogens of humans","ribosome profiling analysis","chimaeric sequences","translation","horses","cattle","goats","pigs","high-resolution analysis of transcription","transcripts","result of EToV infection","deep sequencing","U2","neglected group of livestock pathogens","unique combination of discontinuous","important human pathogens","resulting proteins U1","Comparative genomic analysis","inferred amino acid sequences","domestic ungulates","host transcription","Ribo-seq","range of species","domestic animal virus","acute self-limiting gastroenteritis","severe acute respiratory syndrome","novel CUG-initiated ORFs","subfamily Torovirinae","family Coronaviridae","order Nidovirales","coronavirus","changes","purifying selection","characteristic","sheep","nidovirus replication cycle","relative expression levels","differences","SARS","ribosomes","unknown open reading frames","similarities","common features","ability","Toroviruses","sgRNAs","treatment","vaccine","results","genome","mechanisms","gastrointestinal disease","study","nucleocapsid","UTR"],"language":"en"},

Current infection control guidelines aim to prevent transmission via contact and respiratory droplet routes and do not consider the possibility of airborne transmission. It was hypothesised that subjects with CF produce viable respirable bacterial aerosols with coughing. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken of 15 children and 13 adults with CF, 26 chronically infected with P aeruginosa. A cough aerosol sampling system enabled fractioning of respiratory particles of different sizes and culture of viable Gram-negative non-fermentative bacteria. Cough aerosols were collected during 5 min of voluntary coughing and during a sputum induction procedure when tolerated. Standardised quantitative culture and genotyping techniques were used. RESULTS: P aeruginosa was isolated in cough aerosols of 25 subjects (89%), 22 of whom produced sputum samples. P aeruginosa from sputum and paired cough aerosols were indistinguishable by molecular typing. In four cases the same genotype was isolated from ambient room air. Approximately 70% of viable aerosols collected during voluntary coughing were of particles \u2A7D3.3 \u03BCm aerodynamic diameter. P aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter xylosoxidans were cultivated from respiratory particles in this size range. Positive room air samples were associated with high total counts in cough aerosols (p = 0.003). The magnitude of cough aerosols was associated with higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s (r = 0.45, p = 0.02) and higher quantitative sputum culture results (r = 0.58, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: During coughing, patients with CF produce viable aerosols of P aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria of respirable size range, suggesting the potential for airborne transmission.","publish_time":"2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wainwright, C E; France, M W; O\u2019Rourke, P; Anuj, S; Kidd, T J; Nissen, M D; Sloots, T P; Coulter, C; Ristovski, Z; Hargreaves, M; Rose, B R; Harbour, C; Bell, S C; Fennelly, K P","journal":"Thorax","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9721af1b88d60abbff468d841941f85a13731861.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2764123.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19574243/; https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.2008.112466","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viable aerosols of P aeruginosa","paired cough aerosols","magnitude of cough aerosols","viable respirable bacterial aerosols","CF","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","voluntary coughing","sputum samples","higher quantitative sputum culture results","cough aerosol sampling system","culture of viable Gram-negative non-fermentative bacteria","patients","Standardised quantitative culture","Gram-negative bacteria of respirable size range","sputum induction procedure","possibility of airborne transmission","subjects","fractioning of respiratory particles of different sizes","Positive room air samples","respiratory droplet routes","ambient room air","common bacterial pathogen","higher forced expiratory volume","Achromobacter xylosoxidans","Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","Burkholderia cenocepacia","high total counts","cystic fibrosis","contact","potential","molecular typing","Current infection control guidelines","children","genotype","genotyping techniques","\u03BCm aerodynamic diameter","cross-sectional study","METHODS","adults","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","cases"],"language":"en"},

However, capturing and recovering these viruses from environmental water remain formidable barriers to routine use. Here, we compared the recovery efficiencies of human adenoviruses (HAdVs) and human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) from 10-L river water samples seeded with raw human wastewater (100 and 10 mL) using hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF) and glass wool filter (GWF) methods. The mean recovery efficiencies of HAdVs in river water samples through HFUF were 36 and 86 % for 100 and 10 mL of seeded human wastewater, respectively. In contrast, the estimated mean recovery efficiencies of HAdVs in river water samples through GWF were 1.3 and 3 % for 100 and 10 mL seeded raw human wastewater, respectively. Similar trends were also observed for HPyVs. Recovery efficiencies of HFUF method were significantly higher (P \u003C 0.05) than GWF for both HAdVs and HPyVs.

This virus, already detected worldwide, has been associated to several diseases and was implicated as the etiological agent of a disease named postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. Several methods have been described for the detection of PCV2, being real-time PCR the most simple and reliable. As far as we know, all the real-time PCR systems described until now are based on ORF2 gene, that exhibit the highest variability. This paper reports the development and validation of a real-time PCR targeted to ORF1 and based on a TaqMan probe for the detection of porcine circovirus type 2 DNA in swine samples. Due to the lack of PCV1 samples, the ability of the test to discriminate between PCV1 and PCV2 positive samples was evaluated in silico. Estimations of 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity were obtained based on the qPCR results with panel of 81 swine samples (known PCV2-positive (n = 50); known PCV2-negative (n = 17); samples positive to other common swine viral pathogens (n = 13) and one sample from a BFDV-positive parrot (n = 1)). Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation obtained with three positive samples of different viral charges in five replicates or in five independent assays were below the acceptance threshold. The limit of detection determined with a recombinant plasmid containing the amplicon, led to conclude that this assay can detect at least three plasmid copies.","publish_time":"2018-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henriques, Ana Margarida; Duarte, Margarida; Barros, S\u00EDlvia Carla; Fagulha, Teresa; Ramos, Fernanda; Lu\u00EDs, Tiago; Fevereiro, Miguel","journal":"VirusDisease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd4798696373c4c672c4d9625811e5aae9ffce49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6111954.xml.json","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13337-018-0476-y.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159371/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13337-018-0476-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["samples positive","PCV2 positive samples","PCV2-positive","swine samples","detection of PCV2","positive samples of different viral charges","lack of PCV1 samples","PCV2-negative","detection of porcine circovirus type","BFDV-positive parrot","real-time PCR systems","genus Circovirus","limit of detection","common swine viral pathogens","recombinant plasmid","plasmid copies","non-enveloped virus","inter-assay coefficients of variation","single stranded circular DNA genome","Circoviridae family","replicates","postweaning multisystemic","TaqMan probe","independent assays","etiological agent","qPCR results","development","validation","ORF1","panel","test","acceptance threshold","syndrome","silico","ORF2 gene","highest variability","specificity","sensitivity","paper","amplicon","Estimations","diseases","methods"],"language":"en"},

Due to the complexity of zoonotic pathogens, it is essential that research and response to EIDs be a transdisciplinary effort. And while crisis and circumstance may be the initial catalyst for responding to an outbreak, we provide examples of how transdisciplinary scientific collectives, which are organized and solidified in advance of crises, can transform the way the world responds to outbreaks and in some cases could even prevent one from occurring (1). Current methods for assessing whether a cooperative engagement between countries is producing measurable and sustainable value is based on the ideas of return on investment and do not consider the inherent importance of relationships. In this article, we apply the idea of return on relationships (ROR) and propose a method for measuring ROR, using a system dynamics modeling framework commonly used in epidemiology. Tracking the numerous and diverse scientific collaborations that emerged from a training workshop for biosurveillance of bats held in Singapore in 2014, we apply a methodology for visualizing and measuring the relationship networks and outcomes that result. Additionally, the collaborative, multidisciplinary network that coalesced in response to the Hantavirus outbreak in New Mexico is 1993 is discussed as an example of the long-term benefits of ROR.","publish_time":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fair, Jeanne M.; Stokes, Martha Mangum; Pennington, Deana; Mendenhall, Ian H.","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51e85d19c2cec68dfff68624118086ec2bb6de73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4753292.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2016.00009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26913278/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ROR"],"locations":["Singapore","New Mexico"],"keyphrases":["response","EIDs","long-term benefits of ROR","transdisciplinary scientific collectives","biosurveillance infrastructure","biosurveillance of bats","Hantavirus outbreak","ideas of return","idea of return","transdisciplinary effort","diverse scientific collaborations","complexity of zoonotic pathogens","inherent importance of relationships","public health","tremendous challenge","countries","cooperative engagement","system dynamics modeling framework","training workshop","sustainable value","research","examples","relationship networks","initial catalyst","New Mexico","Emerging infectious diseases","outbreaks","way","visualizing","circumstance","epidemiology","investment","multidisciplinary network","globe","majority","Current methods","world","collaborative","methodology","outcomes","crisis","Singapore","advance of crises","cases","article"],"language":"en"},

Guidance is therefore needed regarding use of agents with potential activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pediatrics. METHODS: A panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists from 18 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined based on review of best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: Given the typically mild course of pediatric COVID-19, supportive care alone is suggested for the overwhelming majority of cases. The panel suggests a decision-making framework for antiviral therapy that weighs risks and benefits based on disease severity as indicated by respiratory support needs, with consideration on a case-by-case basis of potential pediatric risk factors for disease progression. If an antiviral is used, the panel suggests remdesivir as the preferred agent. Hydroxychloroquine could be considered for patients who are not candidates for remdesivir or when remdesivir is not available. Antivirals should preferably be used as part of a clinical trial if available. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is not necessary for the great majority of pediatric patients. For those rare children who develop severe or critical disease, this guidance offer an approach for decision-making regarding antivirals, informed by available data. As evidence continues to evolve rapidly, the need for updates to the guidance is anticipated.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiotos, Kathleen; Hayes, Molly; Kimberlin, David W; Jones, Sarah B; James, Scott H; Pinninti, Swetha G; Yarbrough, April; Abzug, Mark J; MacBrayne, Christine E; Soma, Vijaya L; Dulek, Daniel E; Vora, Surabhi B; Waghmare, Alpana; Wolf, Joshua; Olivero, Rosemary; Grapentine, Steven; Wattier, Rachel L; Bio, Laura; Cross, Shane J; Dillman, Nicholas O; Downes, Kevin J; Timberlake, Kathryn; Young, Jennifer; Orscheln, Rachel C; Tamma, Pranita D; Schwenk, Hayden T; Zachariah, Philip; Aldrich, Margaret; Goldman, David L; Groves, Helen E; Lamb, Gabriella S; Tribble, Alison C; Hersh, Adam L; Thorell, Emily A; Denison, Mark R; Ratner, Adam J; Newland, Jason G; Nakamura, Mari M","journal":"J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f71093501ded729b5b30edf43438059671591d00.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32318706/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piaa045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Coronavirus Disease","critical disease","remdesivir","great majority of pediatric patients","mild course of pediatric COVID","small proportion of pediatric patients","disease severity","disease progression","antiviral therapy","available data","panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians","case basis of potential pediatric risk factors","set of guidance statements","review of best available evidence","Antivirals","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","web-based surveys","potential activity","decision-making framework","critical illness","rare children","respiratory support needs","overwhelming majority of cases","pharmacists","risks","benefits","expert opinion","use of agents","diverse North American institutions","consideration","pediatrics","approach","series of teleconferences","supportive care","preferred agent","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","candidates","RESULTS","clinical trial","updates","BACKGROUND","Hydroxychloroquine"],"language":"en"},

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a major enteric pathogen of the coronavirus family that causes extensive mortality among piglets. The involvement of p53 during PEDV infection has not previously been investigated. In this study, we detected p53 upregulation in response to PEDV infection. Treatment with a p53 specific activator or p53 overexpression markedly decreased viral replication, and we showed that there was more viral progeny produced in p53 knock-out cells than in p53 wild-type cells. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of viral infection by p53 was mediated via p53-dependent IFN signaling, leading to IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) activation, as well as the upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and IFN-\u03B2 released from infected cells. These findings demonstrate that p53 suppresses PEDV infection, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for combatting this deadly disease in piglets.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hao, Zhichao; Fu, Fang; Cao, Liyan; Guo, Longjun; Liu, Jianbo; Xue, Mei; Feng, Li","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34f9f958f686a44e5ace7a5ec825a69298e63764.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112615.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589018307788; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589018307788; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.02.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30784764/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p53 upregulation","p53 overexpression","p53 knock","Abstract p53","involvement of p53","p53-dependent IFN","p53 specific activator","PEDV infection","p53 wild-type cells","upregulation of IFN","inhibition of viral infection","IFN-\u03B2","viral progeny","viral replication","IFN-stimulated response element","certain viral infections","infected cells","piglets","stimulated genes","coronavirus family","major enteric pathogen","novel therapeutic strategy","activation","ISRE","ISGs","deadly disease","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","DNA damage","extensive mortality","responses","tumor suppressor gene","stressful conditions","Treatment","findings","contexts","study"],"language":"en"},

Several genera belong to this family, including the Hepacivirus genus, of which hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the prototype member, and the Flavivirus genus, which contains both dengue virus and Zika virus. Viruses of these genera differ in many respects, such as the mode of transmission or the course of infection, which is either predominantly persistent in the case of HCV or acutely self-limiting in the case of flaviviruses. Although the fundamental replication strategy of Flaviviridae members is similar, during the past few years, important differences have been discovered, including the way in which these viruses exploit cellular resources to facilitate viral propagation. These differences might be responsible, at least in part, for the various biological properties of these viruses, thus offering the possibility to learn from comparisons. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of how Flaviviridae viruses manipulate and usurp cellular pathways in infected cells.

These five nutrients are highly abundant in beef, and have important physiological roles in anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory reactions, as well as neurological, muscular, retinal, immunological and cardiovascular function. Of particular note, taurine, carnosine, anserine, and creatine are absent from plants, and hydroxyproline is negligible in many plant-source foods. Consumption of 30 g dry beef can fully meet daily physiological needs of the healthy 70-kg adult human for taurine and carnosine, and can also provide large amounts of creatine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline to improve human nutrition and health, including metabolic, retinal, immunological, muscular, cartilage, neurological, and cardiovascular health. The present review provides the public with the much-needed knowledge of nutritionally and physiologically significant amino acids, dipeptides and creatine in animal-source foods (including beef). Dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline are beneficial for preventing and treating obesity, cardiovascular dysfunction, and ageing-related disorders, as well as inhibiting tumorigenesis, improving skin and bone health, ameliorating neurological abnormalities, and promoting well being in infants, children and adults. Furthermore, these nutrients may promote the immunological defense of humans against infections by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (including coronavirus) through enhancing the metabolism and functions of monocytes, macrophages, and other cells of the immune system.

There is heterogeneity in the data and reported diagnostic yields range from 26 to 69%. Therefore, selection criteria for BAL to maximize yield and minimize complications are unclear. Objectives of this study were to determine the diagnostic yield and complication rate of BAL in immunocompromised patients presenting with lung infiltrates, and identify factors impacting these outcomes. Exploratory aims included characterization of pathogens, rate of treatment modification and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective study from January 2012 to December 2016. Patients on mechanical ventilation were excluded. Positive diagnostic yield was defined as confirmed microbiological or cytological diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 217 patients were recruited (70.1% male and mean age: 51.7 \u00B1 14.6 years). Diagnostic yield was 60.8% and complication rate 14.7%. Complications (hypoxemia and endobronchial bleeding) were all sell-limiting. Treatment modification based on BAL results was 63.3%. In 97.0% an infectious aetiology was identified. HIV infection (OR 5.304, 95% CI 1.611\u201317.458, p = 0.006) and severe neutropenia (OR 4.253, 95% CI 1.288\u201314.045, p = 0.018) were associated with positive yield. Leukemia (OR 0.317, 95% CI 0.102\u20130.982, p = 0.047) was associated with lower yield. No factors impacted complication rate. Overall mortality (90-day) was 17.5% and in those with hematologic malignancy, it was 28.3%. CONCLUSION: BAL retains utility in diagnosis of immunocompromised patients with lung infiltrates.

Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and frequently cause asymptomatic infections. However, the underlying mechanism that confers these viral characteristics on high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood. METHODS: We comprehensively investigated the replication, cell tropism, and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues with SARS-CoV included as a comparison. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated in human lung tissues more efficiently than that of SARS-CoV. Within the 48-hour interval, SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.20 folds more infectious virus particles than that of SARS-CoV from the infected lung tissues (P\u003C0.024). SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were similar in cell tropism, with both targeting types I and II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages. Importantly, despite the more efficient virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in the infected human lung tissues. In addition, while SARS-CoV infection upregulated the expression of 11 out of 13 (84.62%) representative pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, SARS-CoV-2 infection only upregulated 5 of these 13 (38.46%) key inflammatory mediators despite replicating more efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided the first quantitative data on the comparative replication capacity and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in human lung tissues. Our results provided important insights on the pathogenesis, high transmissibility, and asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Hin; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Wang, Yixin; Yuen, Terrence Tsz-Tai; Chai, Yue; Hou, Yuxin; Shuai, Huiping; Yang, Dong; Hu, Binjie; Huang, Xiner; Zhang, Xi; Cai, Jian-Piao; Zhou, Jie; Yuan, Shuofeng; Kok, Kin-Hang; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Ivy Hau-Yee; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Sit, Ko-Yung; Au, Wing-Kuk; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4916befbbc078c66427394101459ee932ab3bc4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32270184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","asymptomatic infection of SARS","immune activation profile of SARS","infected lung tissues","infected human lung tissues","efficient virus replication","high transmissibility","cell tropism","asymptomatic infections","RESULTS","types","comparative replication capacity","person transmission","emerging coronavirus","infectious virus particles","key inflammatory mediators","representative pro-inflammatory cytokines","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","viral characteristics","pathogenesis","chemokines","number of common clinical manifestations","BACKGROUND","quantitative data","important insights","folds","interferons","study","underlying mechanism","pneumocytes","hour interval","addition","expression","cases","alveolar macrophages","comparison","laboratory","deaths","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Trypanosomes from bats (Rhinolophus landeri and Hipposideros caffer) captured in Mozambique, southeast Africa, were isolated by hemoculture. Barcoding was carried out through the V7V8 region of Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA and Fluorescent Fragment Length barcoding (FFLB). Phylogenetic inferences were based on SSU rRNA, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and Spliced Leader (SL) genes. Morphological characterization included light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: New trypanosomes from bats clustered together forming a clade basal to a larger assemblage called the T. cruzi clade. Barcoding, phylogenetic analyses and genetic distances based on SSU rRNA and gGAPDH supported these trypanosomes as a new species, which we named Trypanosoma livingstonei n. sp. The large and highly polymorphic SL gene repeats of this species showed a copy of the 5S ribosomal RNA into the intergenic region. Unique morphological (large and broad blood trypomastigotes compatible to species of the subgenus Megatrypanum and cultures showing highly pleomorphic epimastigotes and long and slender trypomastigotes) and ultrastructural (cytostome and reservosomes) features and growth behaviour (when co-cultivated with HeLa cells at 37\u00B0C differentiated into trypomastigotes resembling the blood forms and do not invaded the cells) complemented the description of this species. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic inferences supported the hypothesis that Trypanosoma livingstonei n. sp. diverged from a common ancestral bat trypanosome that evolved exclusively in Chiroptera or switched at independent opportunities to mammals of several orders forming the clade T. cruzi, hence, providing further support for the bat seeding hypothesis to explain the origin of T. cruzi and T. rangeli.","publish_time":"2013-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lima, Luciana; Espinosa-\u00C1lvarez, Oneida; Hamilton, Patrick B; Neves, Luis; Takata, Carmen SA; Campaner, Marta; Attias, M\u00E1rcia; de Souza, Wanderley; Camargo, Erney P; Teixeira, Marta MG","journal":"Parasit Vectors","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff8a8e158d77b0757aa3e3edb068c0766fbec520.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3737117.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23915781/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-221","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["T. cruzi","T. rangeli","Hipposideros","Barcoding"],"organizations":["Fluorescent Fragment","SSU","HeLa"],"locations":["South America","Africa","Europe","Mozambique"],"keyphrases":["cruzi clade","new species","Bat trypanosomes","bat-restricted species","SSU rRNA","New trypanosomes","Phylogenetic inferences","clade basal","gGAPDH","bats","slender trypomastigotes","phylogenetic analyses","hypothesis","Trypanosoma livingstonei","rangeli","broad blood trypomastigotes compatible","common ancestral bat trypanosome","Fluorescent Fragment Length barcoding","southeast Africa","blood forms","intergenic region","HeLa cells","Morphological characterization","polymorphic SL gene repeats","V7V8 region of Small Subunit","South America","host range","generalist agents of human American trypanosomosis","genetic distances","growth behaviour","features","cytostome","subgenus Megatrypanum","glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase","Europe","Hipposideros caffer","pleomorphic epimastigotes","Spliced Leader","Rhinolophus landeri","reservosomes","light","S ribosomal RNA","cultures","orders","larger assemblage","independent opportunities","Mozambique","FFLB","Chiroptera","mammals","origin","transmission electron microscopy","evolutionary history","genes","METHODS","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","support","hemoculture","description","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Despite considerable progress toward understanding the structure\u2013function relationship of TRBP and PACT, their specific roles in these seemingly distinct cellular pathways remain unclear. Both proteins are composed of three copies of the double\u2010stranded RNA\u2010binding domain, two of which interact with dsRNA, while the C\u2010terminal copy mediates protein\u2013protein interactions. PACT and TRBP are found in a complex with the endonuclease Dicer and facilitate processing of immature microRNAs. Their precise contribution to the Dicing step has not yet been defined: possibilities include precursor recruitment, rearrangement of dsRNA within the complex, loading the processed microRNA into the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex, and distinguishing different classes of small dsRNA. TRBP and PACT also interact with the viral dsRNA sensors retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I) and double\u2010stranded RNA\u2010activated protein kinase (PKR). Current models suggest that PACT enables RIG\u2010I to detect a wider range of viral dsRNAs, while TRBP and PACT exert opposing regulatory effects on PKR. Here, the evidence that implicates TRBP and PACT in regulatory RNA processing and viral dsRNA sensing is reviewed and discussed in the context of their molecular structure.

Methods This study used Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and the Bland- Altman plot to analyse the agreement between temperature measurements using an ingestible capsule sensor, a skin sensor and two non-invasive peripheral temperature measurements (axillary and infrared non-contact), collected from a population of febrile patient admitted for infectious disease. Results Of the 77 febrile patients screened, 26 patients were enrolled. The ICC between axillary temperature measurements (Taxi) vs. non-contact measurements (Tno-c) were 0.34 [\u22120.18; 0.63], 0.87 [0.55; 0.94] between Taxi vs. ingestible capsule measurements (Tcap) and 0.12 [\u22120.09; 0.37] between Taxi vs. Tetac. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tno-c was \u22121.18 \u00B0C with limits of agreement (LoA) from \u22122.96 to 0.58 \u00B0C. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tcap was 0.48 \u00B0C, with LoA from \u22120.60 to 1.56 \u00B0C. The mean difference between Taxi vs Tetac was \u22124.23 \u00B0C with LoA from \u22127.22 to \u22121.23 \u00B0C.

These diseases cause significant losses within the pork industry and within the first year after PEDV introduction, approximately 10% of the US herd died due to the disease. Similar to other enteric coronaviruses, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), these emerging swine enteric coronavirus diseases (SECD) are age\u2010dependent, with high morbidity and mortality in neonatal pigs. Since the introduction of SECD, research has focused on investigating viral pathogenesis through experimental inoculation, increasing maternal antibody for neonatal protection, understanding transmission risks through feed and transportation, and outlining the importance of biosecurity in preventing SECD introduction and spread. A survey of swine professionals conducted for this review revealed that the majority of respondents (75%) believe SECD can be eradicated and that most herds have been successful at long\u2010term elimination of SECD after exposure (80%). However, unique properties of SECD, such as ineffective immunity through parenteral vaccination and a low oral infectious dose, play a major role in management of SECD. This review serves to describe the current knowledge of SECD and the characteristics of these viruses which provide both opportunities and challenges for long\u2010term disease control and potential eradication from the US swine population.","publish_time":"2018-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niederwerder, M.

In a routine care setting, we assessed the diagnostic performance of a multiplex PCR assay with respect to conventional microbiological methods, in a continuous series of adult cases of community-acquired acute respiratory illness. We enrolled 279 adult patients hospitalised for community-acquired acute respiratory illness at Tours University Hospital during the winter of 2011\u20132012. Respiratory samples (mostly nasopharyngeal aspirates) were studied prospectively by indirect immunofluorescence assay and multiplex PCR, that enable detection of 8 viruses and 21 respiratory pathogens respectively. In total, 255 of the 279 (91.4%) samples had interpretable results by both methods. At least one respiratory pathogen was detected by multiplex PCR in 171 specimens (65%). Overall, 130 (76%) of the 171 positive samples were positive for only one respiratory pathogen, 37 (22%) samples were positive for two pathogens and four (2%) were positive for three pathogens. With indirect immunofluorescence assay, a respiratory virus was detected in 27 of the 255 (11%) specimens. Indirect immunofluorescence assay detected some of the influenza virus A (15/51, 29%) infections identified by multiplex PCR and some (7/15, 47%) human metapneumovirus and (5/12, 42%) respiratory syncytial virus infections, but it did not detect all the adenovirus infections.

There is an urgent need to establish an early detection and high-throughput screening method for CMV infection using portable detection devices. METHODS: An antibody analysis method is reported for the detection and identification of CMV antibodies in serum using a biosensor based on high spatial resolution imaging ellipsometry (BIE). CMV antigen (CMV-3A) was immobilized on silicon wafers and used to capture CMV antibodies in serum. An antibody against human immunoglobulin G (anti-IgG) was used to confirm the IgG antibody against CMV captured by the CMV-3A. RESULTS: Our results show that this assay is rapid and specific for the identification of IgG antibody against CMV. Further, patient serum was quantitatively assessed using the standard curve method, and the quantitative results were in agreement with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The CMV antibody detection sensitivity of BIE reached 0.01 IU/mL. CONCLUSIONS: This novel biosensor may be a valuable diagnostic tool for analysis of IgG antibody against CMV during CMV infection screening.","publish_time":"2015-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Hongliu; Qi, Cai; Niu, Yu; Kang, Tengfei; Wei, Yongxin; Jin, Gang; Dong, Xianzhi; Wang, Chunhua; Zhu, Wei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c4dd391e165ce712cb8871ce3082927bbf21ec9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4546680.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26295458/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136253","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMV antigen","CMV infection screening","identification of CMV antibodies","CMV antibody detection sensitivity of BIE","analysis of IgG antibody","identification of IgG antibody","antibody analysis method","early detection","anti-IgG","high-throughput screening method","portable detection devices","quantitative results","patient serum","standard curve method","novel biosensor","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","high spatial resolution imaging ellipsometry","valuable diagnostic tool","newborns","common infectious cause of mental disability","agreement","human immunoglobulin G","developed countries","urgent need","IU","METHODS","silicon wafers","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Cytomegalovirus"],"language":"en"},

Morphological, anatomical, chemical and DNA markers solve the problem by differentiating the genuine material from the adulterants, substitutes and spurious drugs. DNA markers use nucleotide sequences to identify species; it takes preference over the other two markers being not age dependent, tissue specific and having a higher discriminating power. Therefore, characterization of plants with such markers is an ideal approach for identification of medicinal plant species and populations/varieties of the same species.

To investigate the epidemic characteristics of PEDV, the complete ORF3 genes of 14 PEDV field strains from central China during 2012 to 2013 were cloned, sequenced and compared with reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete ORF3 gene showed that the PEDVs in central China and the reference strains could be divided into three groups: G1, G2, and G3. The 14 PEDV isolates were classified as G1 and showed a close relationship to some Chinese strains isolated previously in central China and differed genetically from recent isolates from southern China, Korean strains (SM98 and DB1865, 2012), the Chinese LZC strain (2007), and the vaccine strain (CV777) being used in China. Our findings suggested that the PEDVs circulating between 2012 and 2013 in central China might have evolved from earlier strains in the local region. To determine the reason for recent vaccination failures, we also studied variations in antigenicity of field strains by analyzing the three neutralizing epitope regions in the S gene. The results showed that the neutralizing epitopes at aa 245-252 were highly conserved, but most of the amino acid changes occurred in the epitope regions aa 7-146 and 271-278. We speculate that the amino acid mutations in the neutralizing epitope regions may be associated with changes in the antigenicity of PEDV and consequently result in vaccination failure. Together, these findings may be useful for understanding the epidemiology of PEDV and may be relevant for designing of new and more efficacious vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Renfeng; Qiao, Songlin; Yang, Yanyan; Su, Yunfang; Zhao, Pu; Zhou, Enmin; Zhang, Gaiping","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41555d21b5f64caf5e4a72c7b3b7024ee7595bad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087087.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24292967/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1929-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["central China","PEDV field strains","Chinese strains","reference strains","Korean strains","earlier strains","southern China","antigenicity of field strains","PEDV isolates","antigenicity of PEDV","neutralizing epitope regions","epidemiology of PEDV","epitope regions aa","epidemic characteristics of PEDV","amino acid changes","neutralizing epitopes","recent isolates","G1","PEDVs","findings","complete ORF3 genes","amino acid mutations","recent vaccination failures","Chinese LZC strain","S gene","vaccine strain","porcine epidemic diarrhea","devastating impact","swine","SM98","variations","DB1865","close relationship","industry","Phylogenetic analysis","G2","reason","local region","CV777","groups","efficacious vaccines","G3","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of HSCT recipients with HRV infection from the time molecular detection methods were implemented at our institution in 2008. Factors associated with proven or possible HRV pneumonia at the first HRV detection were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. We then characterized all episodes of proven and possible HRV pneumonia from the initial HRV infection through a 1-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2011, 63 HSCT recipients had \u2265 1 documented HRV infections. At first HRV detection, 36 (57%) patients had HRV URI and 27 (43%) had proven or possible HRV pneumonia; in multivariate analysis, hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio [OR] 9.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3\u201371.7; P=0.03) and isolation of respiratory co-pathogen(s) (OR 24.2, 95%CI 2.0\u2013288.4; P=0.01) were independently associated with pneumonia. During the study period, 22 patients had 25 episodes of proven HRV pneumonia. Fever (60%), cough (92%), sputum production (61%), and dyspnea (60%) were common symptoms. Fifteen (60%) episodes demonstrated bacterial (n=n=7), fungal (n=n=5), or viral (n=n=3) co-infection. Among the remaining 10 (40%) cases of HRV monoinfection, patients\u2019 oxygen saturations ranged from 80% to 97% on ambient air, and computed tomography scans showed peribronchiolar, patchy, ground glass infiltrates. CONCLUSIONS: HRV pneumonia is relatively common after HSCT and frequently accompanied by bacterial co-infection. As use of molecular assays for respiratory viral diagnosis becomes widespread, HRV will be increasingly recognized as a significant cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.","publish_time":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacobs, S.E.; Soave, R.; Shore, T.B.; Satlin, M.J.; Schuetz, A.N.; Magro, C.; Jenkins, S.G.; Walsh, T.J.","journal":"Transplant Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94acf09e4e9f062bdde1ad9d46150e3f1ba9226e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1625e73982540a837224c0b47243b1984b4b992c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3962254.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.12111; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3962254?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23890179/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT","HRV","HRV URI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV detection","possible HRV pneumonia","HRV URI","episodes of proven HRV pneumonia","initial HRV infection","cases of HRV monoinfection","documented HRV infections","significant cause of pneumonia","bacterial co-infection","common cause of upper respiratory infection","respiratory viral diagnosis","isolation of respiratory co-pathogen","retrospective chart review of HSCT recipients","multivariate analysis","lower respiratory illness","time molecular detection methods","common symptoms","study period","use of molecular assays","year follow-up period","computed tomography scans","hematopoietic stem cell transplant","HRVs","hypoalbuminemia","patients\u2019 oxygen saturations","odds ratio","ground glass infiltrates","ambient air","role","immunocompromised hosts","univariate","Human rhinoviruses","BACKGROUND","Factors","CONCLUSIONS","confidence interval","cough","institution","sputum production","Fever","dyspnea","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Cox regression results showed a significantly shorter viral positivity duration was related to younger [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.658, p = 0.017], not severe patient (HR = 0.653, p = 0.076), higher count of lymphocytes (HR = 1.464, p = 0.033), eosinophils (HR = 1.514, p = 0.020) and CD8\u002B T cells (HR=1.745, p=0.033), and lower IL-6 (HR = 0.664, p = 0.036) and IL-10 (HR = 0.631, p = 0.021). Multivariate analysis with covariables adjusted results showed that the count of CD8\u002B T cells (HR=2.376, p=0.114) was a predominant risk factor for the SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration. INTERPRETATION: Our findings firstly provided early laboratory parameters such as count of CD8\u002B T cells, as risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity, which have significance in control and prevention of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Aifen; He, Ze-Bao; Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Jian-Gang; Zhang, Xia; Yan, Wei-Hua","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61a1fe57af708b2892c49c8dd5ae2a20c158a5bc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337591/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa490","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HR","duration of SARS","confirmed SARS-CoV","day SARS-CoV","median SARS-CoV","shorter viral positivity duration","early risk factors","T cells","count of CD8","days","predominant risk factor","early laboratory parameters","FINDINGS","cohort","patients","higher count of lymphocytes","laboratory data","Clinical information","Pneumonia COVID","lower IL","Cox regression results","range","interval","covariables","control","significance","infection","electronic medical records","prospective study","hazard ratio","prevention","Multivariate analysis","severe patient","eosinophils","disease","METHODS","BACKGROUND","INTERPRETATION","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

To distinguish human enteroviruses (HEV) and rhinoviruses (HRV), samples positive for picornaviruses were further characterized by sequence analysis. RESULTS: Candidate pathogens were detected by MassTag PCR in 27 of the 44 (61%) specimens that previously were rated negative. Sixteen of these 27 specimens (59%) contained picornaviruses; of these 9 (57%) contained RNA of a recently discovered clade of rhinoviruses. Bocaviruses were detected in three patients by RT-PCR.

Crowd management today needs to minimise the chances of occurrence of stampedes, fires and other disasters and also to deal with the ongoing threat of terrorism and outbreak of communicable diseases like EBOLA, HIV Aids, Swine Influenza H1N1, H1N2, various strands of flu, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). These challenges have created a need for using all available resources, especially modern tools and technology, when dealing with crowds. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), which is already benefiting many industrial and government organisations around the world, may be useful for scanning crowded locations and hence in helping to prevent overcrowding. Other wireless technologies should also be considered for possible use in crowded events. Ideally, some of the regular crowded event locations should be transformed into smart cities. In this article we shall discuss different kinds of crowds and technologies for their management. In particular, we shall analyse cases where wireless and mobile technologies can be utilised effectively.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in IBV entry are not well characterized. In this study, systematic approaches were used to dissect IBV entry process in various susceptible cells. First, we observed that lipid rafts were involved in IBV attachment. Second, low pH in intracyplasmic vesicles was required for virus entry. By using the specific clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) inhibitor or knock down of clathrin heavy chain (CHC), we demonstrated that IBV mainly utilized the CME for its entry. Furthermore, GTPase dynamin1 was involved in virus containing vesicle scission and internalization. Surprisingly, CME adaptor Eps15 had no effect on IBV internalization. Third, the penetration of IBV into cells led to active cytoskeleton rearrangement. After internalization, virus particles moved along with the classical endosome/lysosome track, as evidenced by co-localization of R18 labeled IBV with vehicle markers Rab5/Rab7/LAMP1 along with the infection time course. Functional inactivation of Rab5 and Rab7 significantly inhibited IBV infection. VCP, a protein helps early endosome maturation, was involved virus trafficking. Finally, by using the dual R18/DiOC labeled IBV, we observed that membrane fusion with late endosome/lysosome membranes was induced between 2-3 h.p.i.. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that IBV virions attach to lipid rafts and are internalized into cells via CME, move along with early/late endosomes-lysosomes, finally fuse with late endosome-lysosome membranes, release virus genome into cytoplasm. This study provides comprehensive images of IBV attachment-internalization-trafficking-fusion steps. IBV, the avian coronavirus isolated in 1937, infects chicken and causes economic loss in poultry industry. It has been reported that the entry of IBV requires low pH. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IBV internalization and trafficking remain to be clarified. Therefore, we employed multiple chemical and molecular approaches to dissect the entry mechanisms of IBV in susceptible cells. Our results showed IBV entry was significantly inhibited when clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) was blocked by chemical inhibitor or depletion of clathrin protein. Moreover, by using R18-labeled IBV, we found that IBV particles attached to lipid rafts, led to actin rearrangement, and moved along with the entire endosomal system. R18/DiOC labeling method showed that IBV fused with late endosomes or lysosomes. This is the first report to describe the entire entry process of IBV, allowing for a better understanding of the infection process of group III avian coronavirus.","publish_time":"2018-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Huan; Sun, Yingjie; Mao, Xiang; Meng, Chunchun; Tan, Lei; Song, Cuiping; Qiu, Xusheng; Ding, Chan; Liao, Ying","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29081ff4d2fc20c6314329462fef0b9b34b90ba6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d1c77a93f69b5dbcf3806674bff9fe4677209ae5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/352898","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","CME","VCP","III"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry of IBV","IBV internalization","IBV particles","IBV virions","penetration of IBV","IBV entry process","entry mechanisms of IBV","inhibited IBV infection","entire entry process of IBV","virus entry","comprehensive images of IBV attachment-internalization","virus trafficking","virus particles","late endosome-lysosome membranes","molecular mechanisms","lipid rafts","release virus genome","clathrin-mediated endocytosis","late endosomes-lysosomes","classical endosome","molecular approaches","dual R18","early endosome maturation","infection process of group","depletion of clathrin protein","various susceptible cells","CME adaptor Eps15","pathogenesis of infectious bronchitis virus","specific clathrin mediated endocytosis","Rab7","lysosome track","chemical inhibitor","poultry industry","clathrin heavy chain","trafficking-fusion steps","co-localization of R18","avian coronavirus","study","low pH","infection time course","membrane fusion","systematic approaches","economic loss","economic importance","actin rearrangement","vehicle markers Rab5","Functional inactivation of Rab5","DiOC labeling method","active cytoskeleton rearrangement","entire endosomal system","LAMP1","biology","intracyplasmic vesicles","effect","better understanding","chicken","cytoplasm","CHC","vesicle scission","VCP","report","GTPase dynamin1","findings","results"],"language":"en"},

P. Stowell and Y. C. Lee, Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem., 37 (1980) 225\u2013281]. The outstanding progresses achieved since then in the field of the \u201Cglycoside cluster effect\u201D has witnessed considerable creativity in the design and synthetic strategies toward a vast array of novel carbohydrate structures and reflects the dynamic activity in the field even since the recent chapter by the Nicotra group in this series [F. Nicotra, L. Cipolla, F. Peri, B. La Ferla, and C. Radaelli, Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem., 61 (2007) 353\u2013398]. Beyond the more classical neoglycoproteins and glycopolymers (not covered in this work) a wide range of unprecedented and often artistically beautiful multivalent and monodisperse nanostructures, termed glycodendrimers for the first time in 1993, has been created. This chapter briefly surveys the concept of multivalency involved in carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions. The topic is also discussed in regard to recent steps undertaken in glycobiology toward identification of lead candidates using microarrays and modern analytical tools. A systematic description of glycocluster and glycodendrimer synthesis follows, starting from the simplest architectures and ending in the most complex ones. Presentation of multivalent glycostructures of intermediate size and comprising, calix[n]arene, porphyrin, cyclodextrin, peptide, and carbohydrate scaffolds, has also been intercalated to better appreciate the growing synthetic complexity involved. A subsection describing novel all-carbon-based glycoconjugates such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes is inserted, followed by a promising strategy involving dendrons self-assembling around metal chelates. The chapter then ends with those glycodendrimers that have been prepared using commercially available dendrimers possessing varied functionalities, or systematically synthesized using either divergent or convergent strategies.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chabre, Yoann M.; Roy, Ren\u00E9","journal":"Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/875f53ade77f15902f0bda4b7cd3c01a44ab28c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20381707/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065231810630065; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065231810630065; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0065-2318(10)63006-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Stowell","Lee","P.

Postmortem examination can aid in the ascertainment of causes of death. This manuscript describes the study protocol for the Pediatric Respiratory Etiology Surveillance Study (PRESS). OBJECTIVE: This study protocol aims to identify causes and etiologies associated with respiratory disease\u2013related deaths among children (age 1-59 months) with respiratory illness admitted to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), the largest public hospital in Kenya, through postmortem examination coupled with innovative approaches to laboratory investigation. METHODS: We prospectively followed children hospitalized with respiratory illness until the end of clinical care or death. In case of death, parents or guardians were offered grief counseling, and postmortem examination was offered. Lung tissue specimens were collected using minimally invasive tissue sampling and conventional autopsy where other tissues were collected. Tissues were tested using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and multipathogen molecular-based assays to identify pathogens. For each case, clinical and laboratory data were reviewed by a team of pathologists, clinicians, laboratorians, and epidemiologists to assign a cause of and etiology associated with death. RESULTS: We have enrolled pediatric cases of respiratory illness hospitalized at the KNH at the time of this submission; of those, 14.8% (140/945) died while in the hospital. Both analysis and interpretation of laboratory results and writing up of findings are expected in 2019-2020. CONCLUSIONS: Postmortem studies can help identify major pathogens contributing to respiratory-associated deaths in children. This information is needed to develop evidence-based prevention and treatment policies that target important causes of pediatric respiratory mortality and assist with the prioritization of local resources. Furthermore, PRESS can provide insights into the interpretation of results using multipathogen testing platforms in resource-limited settings.

The low inter-assay coefficient of variation recorded demonstrated that this method is highly repeatable. Compared with SPF cats, cytokine production was upregulated in most of the samples from FCoV-positive non-symptomatic cats. The appearance of a case of FIP in the cattery was associated with an increased expression of cytokines, in particular there was an increased production of IL-1\u03B2 and IFN-\u03B3, suggesting that these cytokines might protect infected cats from the disease.

Although use of modern drugs for inflammation has a relieving effect, it is still unsatisfactory. Moreover, the emergence of drug-resistant strains and even new kinds of microorganisms is causing significant morbidity and mortality. Recently, more attention has been focused on herbal medicine to treat various diseases because of the ability of the herbs to affect multiple target signaling pathways and their multiple mechanisms of action. Thus, a large number of studies have reported on the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects of the traditional Chinese herbs. Literature survey was performed by conducting systematic electronic search in PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and in books. This review has listed 11 heat-clearing Chinese herbs (HCCHs) including Scutellaria baicalensis (\u9EC3\u82A9 Hu\u00E1ng Q\u00EDn), Coptis chinensis (\u9EC3\u9023 Hu\u00E1ng Li\u00E1n), Flos Lonicerae (\u91D1\u9280\u82B1 J\u012Bn Y\u00EDn H\u016Ba), Forsythia suspensa (\u9023\u7FF9 Li\u00E1n Qi\u00E0o), Isatidis Folium (\u5927\u9752\u8449 D\u00E0 Q\u012Bn Y\u00E8), Radix Isatidis (\u677F\u85CD\u6839 B\u01CEn L\u00E1n G\u0113n), Viola yedoensis (\u7D2B\u82B1\u5730\u4E01 Z\u01D0 Hu\u0101 D\u00EC D\u012Bn), Pulsatilla Radix (\u767D\u982D\u7FC1 B\u00E1i T\u00F3u W\u0113n), Andrographis paniculata (\u7A7F\u5FC3\u84EE Chu\u0101n X\u012Bn Li\u00E1n), Houttuynia cordata (\u9B5A\u8165\u8349 Y\u00FA X\u012Bng C\u01CEo), and Patrinia Herba (\u6557\u91AC\u8349 B\u00E0i Ji\u00E0n C\u01CEo), which have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects, and has described their effects through different mechanisms of action and multiple targets. Their ability to affect multiple target signaling pathways and their potential mechanisms of action contributing to their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activity may be related to their action of removing heat and counteracting toxicity. Further studies are needed on the collection of HCCHs to know the detailed mechanism of action of herbs in this group for the assessment of effective drug.","publish_time":"2014-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muluye, Rekik A.; Bian, Yuhong; Alemu, Paulos N.","journal":"Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42bb088042f9400cf38a2455442ad121298daffa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4003708.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S222541101630222X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S222541101630222X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24860732/; https://doi.org/10.4103/2225-4110.126635","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Isatidis Folium","Radix Isatidis","Viola","Pulsatilla Radix","Patrinia Herba"],"organizations":["Google Scholar"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiple mechanisms of action","different mechanisms of action","potential mechanisms of action","anti-inflammatory","antimicrobial effects","multiple targets","traditional Chinese herbs","detailed mechanism of action","Radix Isatidis","\u9EC3\u9023 Hu\u00E1ng Li\u00E1n","pathways","ABSTRACT Inflammation","heat","ability","antimicrobial activity","\u9023\u7FF9 Li\u00E1n Qi\u00E0o","body\u2019s regulation of inflammation","Pulsatilla Radix","Isatidis Folium","\u7A7F\u5FC3\u84EE Chu\u0101n X\u012Bn Li\u00E1n","collection of HCCHs","relieving effect","emergence of drug","adverse effect","\u9EC3\u82A9 Hu\u00E1ng Q\u00EDn","assessment of effective drug","large number of studies","\u9B5A\u8165\u8349 Y\u00FA X\u012Bng C\u01CEo","\u6557\u91AC\u8349 B\u00E0i Ji\u00E0n C\u01CEo","Viola yedoensis","Andrographis paniculata","Houttuynia cordata","Flos Lonicerae","\u7D2B\u82B1\u5730\u4E01 Z\u01D0 Hu\u0101 D\u00EC D\u012Bn","Forsythia suspensa","Patrinia Herba","\u91D1\u9280\u82B1 J\u012Bn Y\u00EDn H\u016Ba","\u767D\u982D\u7FC1 B\u00E1i T\u00F3u W\u0113n","\u677F\u85CD\u6839 B\u01CEn L\u00E1n G\u0113n","\u5927\u9752\u8449 D\u00E0 Q\u012Bn Y\u00E8","PubMed","Coptis chinensis","Science Direct","Scutellaria baicalensis","new kinds of microorganisms","systematic electronic search","resistant strains","Google Scholar","normal immune response","group","significant morbidity","various diseases","herbal medicine","use of modern drugs","mortality","counteracting toxicity","Literature survey","attention","books","review"],"language":"en"},

Despite the importance of hantaviruses for public health, there is no consensus on their evolutionary history and especially the frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species virus transmission. Documenting the extent of hantavirus biodiversity, and particularly their range of mammalian hosts, is critical to resolving this issue. Here, we describe four novel hantaviruses (Huangpi virus, Lianghe virus, Longquan virus, and Yakeshi virus) sampled from bats and shrews in China, and which are distinct from other known hantaviruses. Huangpi virus was found in Pipistrellus abramus, Lianghe virus in Anourosorex squamipes, Longquan virus in Rhinolophus affinis, Rhinolophus sinicus, and Rhinolophus monoceros, and Yakeshi virus in Sorex isodon, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of the available diversity of hantaviruses reveals the existence of four phylogroups that infect a range of mammalian hosts, as well as the occurrence of ancient reassortment events between the phylogroups. Notably, the phylogenetic histories of the viruses are not always congruent with those of their hosts, suggesting that cross-species transmission has played a major role during hantavirus evolution and at all taxonomic levels, although we also noted some evidence for virus-host co-divergence. Our phylogenetic analysis also suggests that hantaviruses might have first appeared in Chiroptera (bats) or Soricomorpha (moles and shrews), before emerging in rodent species. Overall, these data indicate that bats are likely to be important natural reservoir hosts of hantaviruses.","publish_time":"2013-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Wen-Ping; Lin, Xian-Dan; Wang, Wen; Tian, Jun-Hua; Cong, Mei-Li; Zhang, Hai-Lin; Wang, Miao-Ruo; Zhou, Run-Hong; Wang, Jian-Bo; Li, Ming-Hui; Xu, Jianguo; Holmes, Edward C.; Zhang, Yong-Zhen","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76d88903e33790c92eeceda1559955a47d97c439.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3567184.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23408889/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Longquan virus","Lianghe virus","Yakeshi virus","Huangpi virus","frequency of virus","cross-species virus transmission","virus-host co-divergence","novel hantaviruses","importance of hantaviruses","known hantaviruses","important natural reservoir hosts of hantaviruses","available diversity of hantaviruses","bats","range of mammalian hosts","phylogenetic analysis","cross-species transmission","Rhinolophus affinis","Rhinolophus monoceros","Rhinolophus sinicus","phylogroups","rodent species","shrews","phylogenetic histories","hantavirus evolution","extent of hantavirus biodiversity","important zoonotic pathogens of humans","Anourosorex squamipes","Pipistrellus abramus","major role","subject of heightened global attention","consensus","occurrence of ancient reassortment events","public health","Soricomorpha","existence","evidence","evolutionary history","Sorex isodon","taxonomic levels","China","moles","Chiroptera","data","issue"],"language":"en"},

Korea experienced an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in 2015, which was characterized by superspreading events in healthcare settings. We aimed to estimate the epidemiologic parameters over time during the outbreak to assess the effectiveness of countermeasures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Publicly available data pertaining to the MERS outbreak in Korea were collected. We estimated the incubation periods of 162 cases whose sources of exposure were identified and the temporal trend was evaluated. Factors influencing incubation duration were analyzed. The generational reproduction number (R(g)) and case reproduction number (R(c)) were estimated over time. RESULTS: The estimated median incubation period was 7.4 days (95% CI, 6.9-8.0). Median incubation periods tended to be longer over time as the disease generation progressed: 6.16 days (95% CI, 5.38-6.97), 7.68 days (95% CI, 7.04-8.44), and 7.95 days (95% CI, 6.25-9.88) in the first, second, and third generations, respectively. The number of days of illness in the source cases at the time of exposure inversely correlated with the incubation periods in the receiving cases (HR 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84-0.99] per one illness day increase; P=0.026). This relationship was consistent (HR 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.93] per one illness day increase) in the multivariable analysis incorporating clinical characteristics, the order of generation, and a link to superspreaders. Because the third generation cases were exposed to their source cases in the early stage (median one day) compared to the second generation cases (median 6 days), the temporal trend of incubation periods appears to be influenced by early isolation of symptomatic cases and reduction of potential exposure to source cases in the later stage. R(g) declined rapidly from 28 to 0.23 in two generations. R(c) dropped below the epidemic threshold at one on May 31, 2015, which approximately coincided with the initiation of the stringent countermeasures. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the initial delay, the stringent countermeasures targeted towards second generation cases appeared to effectively contain the MERS outbreak in Korea as suggested by the decline of R(c) shortly after implementation. Except for superspreading events, the transmission potential for MERS-CoV seems to be low. Further research should be focused on characterizing superspreaders in comparison to non-transmitting cases with regard to environmental, behavioral, and virologic and host genetic factors in order to better prepare for future outbreaks of MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Sun Hee; Kim, Woo Joo; Yoo, Jin-Hong; Choi, Jung-Hyun","journal":"Infect Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e43db4bbfa0307b42810ceb2b3cd07e2c321e2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4945720.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2016.48.2.108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27433381/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Korea"],"keyphrases":["generation cases","source cases","receiving cases","MERS outbreak","Median incubation periods","number of days","non-transmitting cases","MERS-CoV","early isolation of symptomatic cases","order of generation","time of exposure","temporal trend of incubation periods","estimated median incubation period","incubation duration","disease generation","Korea","decline of R","illness day increase","stringent countermeasures","outbreak of emerging infections","future outbreaks of MERS","reduction of potential exposure","sources of exposure","early stage","Epidemiologic parameters","case reproduction number","generational reproduction number","superspreading events","effectiveness of countermeasures","generations","outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","transmission potential","characterizing superspreaders","later stage","host genetic factors","planning infection control policies","virologic","regard","multivariable analysis","comparison","available data pertaining","clinical characteristics","METHODS","initial delay","RESULTS","MATERIALS","healthcare settings","BACKGROUND","link","CONCLUSIONS","relationship","research","epidemic threshold","initiation","implementation"],"language":"en"},

Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3\u002BCD4\u002B T cells, CXCR3\u002BCD8\u002B T cells, and CXCR3\u002B NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14\u002BCD11c\u002BCD11b(mid) regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-\u03B1 was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2(-) and TMPRSS2(-) which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leng, Zikuan; Zhu, Rongjia; Hou, Wei; Feng, Yingmei; Yang, Yanlei; Han, Qin; Shan, Guangliang; Meng, Fanyan; Du, Dongshu; Wang, Shihua; Fan, Junfen; Wang, Wenjing; Deng, Luchan; Shi, Hongbo; Li, Hongjun; Hu, Zhongjie; Zhang, Fengchun; Gao, Jinming; Liu, Hongjian; Li, Xiaoxia; Zhao, Yangyang; Yin, Kan; He, Xijing; Gao, Zhengchao; Wang, Yibin; Yang, Bo; Jin, Ronghua; Stambler, Ilia; Lim, Lee Wei; Su, Huanxing; Moskalev, Alexey; Cano, Antonio; Chakrabarti, Sasanka; Min, Kyung-Jin; Ellison-Hughes, Georgina; Caruso, Calogero; Jin, Kunlin; Zhao, Robert Chunhua","journal":"Aging Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/645b539149f80c3926326508dc8209869eeb9807.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4b983de85478a07cfe894da64057fbd13c1826c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7069465.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32257537/; https://doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.0228","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSC","NK"],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["enrolled patients","severe COVID","days","MSC treatment group","T cells","MSC transplantation","NK cells","pneumonia","intravenous transplantation of MSCs","MSC injection","overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3","Mesenchymal stem cells","immune function levels","adverse effects","group of CD14","pulmonary function","China","severe patient","severe condition","placebo control group","comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function","cytokine storm","clinical outcomes","functional outcomes","novel coronavirus disease","CD11b","CD4","CD8","changes of inflammatory","regulatory DC cell population","CD11c","ACE2","Beijing YouAn Hospital","gene expression profile","outbreak","key","C-reactive protein","peripheral lymphocytes","Wuhan","symptoms","level of TNF","addition","TMPRSS2","infection","study","HCoV"],"language":"en"},

We studied whether the aqueous extract of Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq (STE) has antiviral activity. STE inhibited replication of EV71, as evident by its ability to diminish plaque formation and cytopathic effect induced by EV71, and to inhibit the synthesis of viral RNA and protein. Moreover, daily single-dose STE treatment significantly improved the survival of EV71-infected mice, and ameliorated the symptoms. Mechanistically, STE exerts multiple effects on enteroviral infection. Treatment with STE reduced viral attachment and entry; the cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 G (eIF4G) by EV71 protease, 2A(pro); virus-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation; and relocation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It was accompanied by a decline in EV71-associated hyperphosphorylation of p38 kinase and EPS15. It is plausible that STE may inhibit ROS-induced p38 kinase activation, and subsequent hnRNP A1 relocation and EPS15-mediated membrane trafficking in infected cells.

Annually millions of animals are moved across Europe for the purposes of breeding, fattening and slaughter. Data on the number of animals moved were obtained from the Directorate General Sanco (DG Sanco) for 2011. These were converted to livestock units to enable direct comparison across species and their movements were mapped, used to calculate the indegrees and outdegrees of 27 European countries and the density and transitivity of movements within Europe. This provided the opportunity to discuss surveillance of European livestock movement taking into account stopping points en-route. RESULTS: High density and transitivity of movement for registered equines, breeding and fattening cattle, breeding poultry and pigs for breeding, fattening and slaughter indicates that hazards have the potential to spread quickly within these populations. This is of concern to highly connected countries particularly those where imported animals constitute a large proportion of their national livestock populations, and have a high indegree. The transport of poultry (older than 72 hours) and unweaned animals would require more rest breaks than the movement of weaned animals, which may provide more opportunities for disease transmission. Transitivity is greatest for animals transported for breeding purposes with cattle, pigs and poultry having values of over 50%. CONCLUSIONS: This paper demonstrated that some species (pigs and poultry) are traded much more frequently and at a larger scale than species such as goats. Some countries are more vulnerable than others due to importing animals from many countries, having imported animals requiring rest-breaks and importing large proportions of their national herd or flock. Such knowledge about the vulnerability of different livestock systems related to trade movements can be used to inform the design of animal health surveillance systems to facilitate the trade in animals between European member states.

Among all open reading frames (orfs) of this virus, the orf3a is the largest, and encodes a protein of 274 amino acids, named as 3a protein. Sequence analysis suggests that the orf3a aligned to one calcium pump present in Plasmodium falciparum and the enzyme glutamine synthetase found in Leptospira interrogans. This sequence similarity was found to be limited only to amino acid residues 209\u2013264 which form the cytoplasmic domain of the orf3a. Furthermore, this region was predicted to be involved in the calcium binding. Owing to this hypothesis, we were driven to establish its calcium binding property in vitro. Here, we expressed and purified the cytoplasmic domain of the 3a protein, called Cyto3a, as a recombinant His-tagged protein in the E. coli. The calcium binding nature was established by performing various staining methods such as ruthenium red and stains-all. 45Ca overlay method was also done to further support the data. Since the 3a protein forms ion channels, we were interested to see any conformational changes occurring in the Cyot3a upon calcium binding, using fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. These studies clearly indicate a significant change in the conformation of the Cyto3a protein after binding with calcium. Our results strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of the 3a protein of SARS-CoV binds calcium in vitro, causing a change in protein conformation.","publish_time":"2014-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Minakshi, Rinki; Padhan, Kartika; Rehman, Safikur; Hassan, Md.

Beginning in August, 2014, increases in severe respiratory illness associated with EV-D68 were reported across the USA. We aimed to describe the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory features of this outbreak, and to better understand the role of EV-D68 in severe respiratory illness. METHODS: We collected regional syndromic surveillance data for epidemiological weeks 23 to 44, 2014, (June 1 to Nov 1, 2014) and hospital admissions data for epidemiological weeks 27 to 44, 2014, (June 29 to Nov 1, 2014) from three states: Missouri, Illinois and Colorado. Data were also collected for the same time period of 2013 and 2012. Respiratory specimens from severely ill patients nationwide, who were rhinovirus-positive or enterovirus-positive in hospital testing, were submitted between Aug 1, and Oct 31, 2014, and typed by molecular sequencing. We collected basic clinical and epidemiological characteristics of EV-D68 cases with a standard data collection form submitted with each specimen. We compared patients requiring intensive care with those who did not, and patients requiring ventilator support with those who did not. Mantel-Haenszel \u03C7(2) tests were used to test for statistical significance. FINDINGS: Regional and hospital-level data from Missouri, Illinois, and Colorado showed increases in respiratory illness between August and September, 2014, compared with in 2013 and 2012. Nationwide, 699 (46%) of 1529 patients tested were confirmed as EV-D68. Among the 614 EV-D68-positive patients admitted to hospital, age ranged from 3 days to 92 years (median 5 years). Common symptoms included dyspnoea (n=513 [84%]), cough (n=500 [81%]), and wheezing (n=427 [70%]); 294 (48%) patients had fever. 338 [59%] of 574 were admitted to intensive care units, and 145 (28%) of 511 received ventilator support; 322 (52%) of 614 had a history of asthma or reactive airway disease; 200 (66%) of 304 patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease required intensive care compared with 138 (51%) of 270 with no history of asthma or reactive airway disease (p=0\u00B70004). Similarly, 89 (32%) of 276 patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease required ventilator support compared with 56 (24%) of 235 patients with no history of asthma or reactive airway disease (p=0\u00B7039). INTERPRETATION: In 2014, EV-D68 caused widespread severe respiratory illness across the USA, disproportionately affecting those with asthma. This unexpected event underscores the need for robust surveillance of enterovirus types, enabling improved understanding of virus circulation and disease burden.

Media representations of unfolding events, scientific uncertainty, and real and perceived risks shape public acceptance of health policy and therefore policy outcomes. To characterize and track views in popular circulation on the causes, consequences and appropriate policy responses to the emergence of Hendra virus as a zoonotic risk, this study examines coverage of this issue in Australian mass media for the period 2007\u20132011. Results demonstrate the predominant explanation for the emergence of Hendra became the encroachment of flying fox populations on human settlement. Depictions of scientific uncertainty as to whom and what was at risk from Hendra virus promoted the view that flying foxes were a direct risk to human health. Descriptions of the best strategy to address Hendra have become polarized between recognized health authorities advocating individualized behaviour changes to limit risk exposure; versus populist calls for flying fox control and eradication. Less than a quarter of news reports describe the ecological determinants of emerging infectious disease or upstream policy solutions. Because flying foxes rather than horses were increasingly represented as the proximal source of human infection, existing policies of flying fox protection became equated with government inaction; the plight of those affected by flying foxes representative of a moral failure. These findings illustrate the potential for health communications for emerging infectious disease risks to become entangled in other political agendas, with implications for the public\u0027s likelihood of supporting public policy and risk management strategies that require behavioural change or seek to address the ecological drivers of incidence.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Degeling, Chris; Kerridge, Ian","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcca62329bc48ab733aff1845bbf07cd469bb200.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116936.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953612008477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23294874/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.12.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953612008477","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["flying foxes","human health","public policy","public acceptance of health policy","flying fox control","health communications","emerging health issues","risk exposure","zoonotic risk","direct risk","policy outcomes","encroachment of flying fox populations","emergence of Hendra virus","existing policies of flying fox protection","recognized health authorities","appropriate policy responses","risk management strategies","upstream policy solutions","emerging infectious disease risks","ecological determinants of emerging infectious disease","human settlement","foxes representative","Abstract Public discourses","Depictions of scientific uncertainty","perceived risks","proximal source of human infection","Australian mass media","ecological drivers of incidence","Media representations of unfolding events","individualized behaviour changes","causes","influence","policymaking","populist calls","coverage","consequences","government inaction","popular circulation","public\u0027s likelihood","potential","behavioural change","implications","political agendas","quarter of news reports","plight","study","predominant explanation","eradication","track views","best strategy","period","moral failure","findings","horses","Descriptions","Results"],"language":"en"},

La evaluaci\u00F3n de un ni\u00F1o febril al regreso de un viaje es cl\u00EDnica: verificaci\u00F3n de los antecedentes y las vacunaciones, b\u00FAsqueda de otros casos en contacto, signos funcionales y f\u00EDsicos, y caracter\u00EDsticas del viaje. Unas pruebas complementarias de rutina completan a menudo la evaluaci\u00F3n para una orientaci\u00F3n sindr\u00F3mica. Si bien las causas de fiebre son, sobre todo, cosmopolitas, la gravedad de la enfermedad ex\u00F3tica obliga a buscarlas prioritariamente. El paludismo debe sospecharse ante una fiebre procedente de \u00C1frica subsahariana. El diagn\u00F3stico se basa en la asociaci\u00F3n de un frotis sangu\u00EDneo y una prueba sensible (gota gruesa, reacci\u00F3n en cadena de la polimerasa [PCR]) o una prueba de diagn\u00F3stico r\u00E1pido (para Plasmodiumfalciparum). Los criterios cl\u00EDnico-biol\u00F3gicos de gravedad son esenciales para orientar y tratar al paciente. En caso de acceso no complicado por P. falciparum, el tratamiento se basa en un tratamiento combinado a base de artemisinina (ACT), artem\u00E9ter-lumefantrina o artenimol-piperaquina. Los accesos graves se tratan con artesunato intravenoso, seguido de ACT oral. Dengue, chikungunya e infecci\u00F3n por virus Zika tienen caracter\u00EDsticas cl\u00EDnicas comunes (fiebre-erupci\u00F3n-artralgias, tratamiento sintom\u00E1tico). En caso de dengue, conviene controlar la aparici\u00F3n de signos de alerta, que podr\u00EDan hacer temer una evoluci\u00F3n negativa. El chikungunya es grave en caso de transmisi\u00F3n en el parto, con un riesgo de encefalitis neonatal. En el ni\u00F1o, el Zika es asintom\u00E1tico o poco sintom\u00E1tico. Pero, en caso de infecci\u00F3n durante el embarazo, el riesgo es el de una embriofetopat\u00EDa. El diagn\u00F3stico de estas arbovirosis se basa en la PCR en la fase aguda y en la serolog\u00EDa secundariamente. La sintomatolog\u00EDa de la fiebre tifoidea es poco espec\u00EDfica, lo cual justifica la pr\u00E1ctica de hemocultivos sistem\u00E1ticos ante una fiebre tras un viaje. Su tratamiento se basa en las cefalosporinas de tercera generaci\u00F3n o el ciprofloxacino, pero las resistencias aumentan. En suma, la diversidad de las etiolog\u00EDas de una fiebre al regreso de un viaje y la potencial gravedad de las infecciones importadas imponen una reflexi\u00F3n sobre el proceso de tratamiento de estos pacientes, en especial en lo referente al riesgo de fiebre hemorr\u00E1gica.","publish_time":"2019-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Minodier, P.; Imbert, P.","journal":"EMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d4fb1653aeb2b97089f4677e4cb4af8b822395f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159023.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1245178919425936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308527/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1245178919425936; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1245-1789(19)42593-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["\u00C1frica subsahariana"],"keyphrases":["viaje","fiebre procedente","fiebre tifoidea","causas de fiebre","riesgo de fiebre hemorr\u00E1gica","tratamiento sintom\u00E1tico","tratamiento combinado","proceso de tratamiento","caso de infecci\u00F3n","caso de dengue","caso de transmisi\u00F3n","caso de acceso","regreso","potencial gravedad","evaluaci\u00F3n","chikungunya","PCR","prueba de diagn\u00F3stico r\u00E1pido","riesgo de encefalitis neonatal","virus Zika","prueba sensible","infecciones importadas","infecciones gastrointestinales","ACT oral","signos funcionales","enfermedades febriles","aparici\u00F3n de signos","ni\u00F1o febril","caracter\u00EDsticas cl\u00EDnicas comunes","erupci\u00F3n","menudo","artesunato intravenoso","reacci\u00F3n","gota gruesa","artem\u00E9ter","casos","cadena","contacto","artralgias","frotis sangu\u00EDneo","base de artemisinina","antecedentes","vacunaciones","b\u00FAsqueda","lumefantrina","rutina","verificaci\u00F3n","pacientes","reflexi\u00F3n","etiolog\u00EDas","parto","pr\u00E1ctica de hemocultivos sistem\u00E1ticos","criterios cl\u00EDnico","ciprofloxacino","piperaquina","pruebas complementarias","accesos graves","fase aguda","problemas dermatol\u00F3gicos","orientaci\u00F3n sindr\u00F3mica","polimerasa","asociaci\u00F3n","cefalosporinas","diversidad","\u00C1frica subsahariana","Plasmodiumfalciparum","extranjero","cosmopolitas","embarazo","enfermedad ex\u00F3tica","serolog\u00EDa","generaci\u00F3n","suma","alerta","sintomatolog\u00EDa","paludismo","arbovirosis","evoluci\u00F3n negativa","resistencias","embriofetopat\u00EDa"],"language":"es"},

Many studies have shown human bocavirus 1 as a pathogen in association with acute respiratory tract infections in children. However, because human bocavirus 1 persists in the upper airways for extensive time periods after acute infection, the definition and diagnostics of acute human bocavirus 1 infection is challenging. Until now, detection of human bocavirus 1 exclusively, high viral load in respiratory samples, and viremia have been associated with a clinical picture of acute respiratory illness. There are no studies showing detection of human bocavirus 1 messenger ribonucleic acid in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a diagnostic marker for acute lower respiratory tract infection. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 17-month-old Latvian boy who presented in intensive care unit with acute bilateral bronchiolitis, with a history of rhinorrhea and cough for 6 days and fever for the last 2 days prior to admission, followed by severe respiratory distress and tracheal intubation. Human bocavirus 1 was the only respiratory virus detected by a qualitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel. For the diagnosis of acute human bocavirus 1 infection, both molecular and serological approaches were used. Human bocavirus 1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected simultaneously in nasopharyngeal aspirate, stool, and blood, as well as in the corresponding cell-free blood plasma by qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, revealing high DNA-copy numbers in nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool. Despite a low-load viremia, human bocavirus 1 messenger ribonucleic acid was found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. For detection of human bocavirus 1-specific antibodies, non-competitive immunoglobulin M and competitive immunoglobulin G enzyme immunoassays were used. The plasma was positive for both human bocavirus 1-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of human bocavirus 1 genomic DNA in blood plasma and human bocavirus 1 messenger ribonucleic acid in peripheral blood mononuclear cells together with human bocavirus 1-specific immunoglobulin M are markers of acute human bocavirus 1 infection that may cause life-threatening acute bronchiolitis.","publish_time":"2019-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ziemele, Inga; Xu, Man; Vilmane, Anda; Rasa-Dzelzkaleja, Santa; Hedman, Lea; Hedman, Klaus; S\u00F6derlund-Venermo, Maria; Nora-Krukle, Zaiga; Murovska, Modra; Gardovska, Dace","journal":"J Med Case Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae4c5ad260f38772c10120bb77062912dcce189e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6744643.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519214/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-019-2222-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of human bocavirus","presence of human bocavirus","diagnostics of acute human bocavirus","markers of acute human bocavirus","diagnosis of acute human bocavirus","acute infection","detected human parvovirus","acute lower respiratory tract infection","acute respiratory tract infections","specific immunoglobulin","acute bilateral bronchiolitis","life-threatening acute bronchiolitis","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","clinical picture of acute respiratory illness","respiratory samples","respiratory virus","messenger ribonucleic acid","non-competitive immunoglobulin","immunoglobulin G antibodies","severe respiratory distress","high DNA","deoxyribonucleic acid","specific antibodies","corresponding cell-free blood plasma","genomic DNA","competitive immunoglobulin G enzyme immunoassays","nasopharyngeal aspirate","days","stool","studies","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","qualitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel","high viral load","low-load viremia","CASE PRESENTATION","diagnostic marker","intensive care unit","definition","extensive time periods","upper airways","association","pathogen","numbers","month-old Latvian boy","history of rhinorrhea","cough","tracheal intubation","admission","children","fever","serological approaches","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In human liver, IFN-\u03BB not only drives antiviral responses, but also promotes inflammation and fibrosis in viral and non-viral diseases. Here we demonstrate that macrophages are primary responders to IFN-\u03BB, uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between IFN-\u03BB producing cells and lymphocyte populations that are not intrinsically responsive to IFN-\u03BB. While CD14(\u002B) monocytes do not express the IFN-\u03BB receptor, IFNLR1, sensitivity is quickly gained upon differentiation to macrophages in vitro. IFN-\u03BB stimulates macrophage cytotoxicity and phagocytosis as well as the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon stimulated genes that mediate immune cell chemotaxis and effector functions. In particular, IFN-\u03BB induced CCR5 and CXCR3 chemokines, stimulating T and NK cell migration, as well as subsequent NK cell cytotoxicity. Using immunofluorescence and cell sorting techniques, we confirmed that human liver macrophages expressing CD14 and CD68 are highly responsive to IFN-\u03BB ex vivo. Together, these data highlight a novel role for macrophages in shaping IFN-\u03BB dependent immune responses both directly through pro-inflammatory activity and indirectly by recruiting and activating IFN-\u03BB unresponsive lymphocytes.","publish_time":"2019-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Read, Scott A.; Wijaya, Ratna; Ramezani-Moghadam, Mehdi; Tay, Enoch; Schibeci, Steve; Liddle, Christopher; Lam, Vincent W.

Particularly, how these systems can help people improve human conditions of health, by taking advantages of the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), regarding early prediction and efficient treatment. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of the current literature available that focuses on information systems on syndromic surveillance using web data. All published items concern articles, books, reviews, reports, conference announcements, and dissertations. We used a variation of PRISMA Statements methodology to conduct a systematic review. The review identifies the relevant published papers from the year 2004 to 2018, systematically includes and explores them to extract similarities, gaps, and conclusions on the research that has been done so far. The results presented concern the year, the examined disease, the web data source, the geographic location/country, and the data analysis method used. The results show that influenza is the most examined infectious disease. The internet tools most used are Twitter and Google. Regarding the geographical areas explored in the published papers, the most examined country is the United States, since many scientists come from this country. There is a significant growth of articles since 2009. There are also various statistical methods used to correlate the data retrieved from the internet to the data from national authorities. The conclusion of all researches is that the Web can be a useful tool for the detection of serious epidemics and for a creation of a syndromic surveillance system using the Web, since we can predict epidemics from web data before they are officially detected in population. With the advance of ICT, Smart Healthcare can benefit from the monitoring of epidemics and the early prediction of such a system, improving national or international health strategies and policy decision. This can be achieved through the provision of new technology tools to enhance health monitoring systems toward the new innovations of Smart Health or eHealth, even with the emerging technologies of Internet of Things. The challenges and impacts of an electronic system based on internet data include the social, medical, and technological disciplines. These can be further extended to Smart Healthcare, as the data streaming can provide with real-time information, awareness on epidemics and alerts for both patients or medical scientists. Finally, these new systems can help improve the standards of human life.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Samaras, Loukas; Garc\u00EDa-Barriocanal, Elena; Sicilia, Miguel-Angel","journal":"Innovation in Health Informatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb91814bdf50b5c074284df791f7a19f0859d5b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153324.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128190432000022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128190432000022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Smart Healthcare","Google","Smart Health"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["internet data","web data source","new systems","data streaming","information systems","health monitoring systems","new Information","data analysis method","new innovations of Smart Health","evolution of Smart Healthcare systems","monitoring of epidemics","examined country","internet tools","examined disease","systematic review","human conditions of health","syndromic surveillance system","emerging technologies of Internet","real-time information","international health strategies","electronic system","provision of new technology tools","early prediction","relevant published papers","detection of serious epidemics","published items","examined infectious disease","medical scientists","results","Communication Technologies","advance of ICT","national authorities","standards of human life","significant growth of articles","reports","reviews","books","alerts","eHealth","current literature available","geographic location","place","advantages","creation","lot of debate","conference announcements","policy decision","useful tool","variation of PRISMA Statements methodology","recent years","influenza","awareness","patients","United States","people","gaps","conclusions","dissertations","technological disciplines","challenges","impacts","efficient treatment","study","geographical areas","Twitter","Things","various statistical methods","similarities","Abstract","Google","researches","purpose","population"],"language":"en"},

However, whether ACE plays an immune function against viral infection in vector insects is unclear. In this study, an ACE gene (LsACE) from the small brown planthopper was found to respond to Rice stripe virus (RSV) infection. The enzymatic activities of LsACE were characterized at different pH and temperature. Twenty planthopper proteins were found to interact with LsACE. RSV infection significantly upregulated LsACE expression in the testicle and fat body. When the expression of LsACE in viruliferous planthoppers was inhibited, the RNA level of the RSV SP gene was upregulated 2-fold in planthoppers, and all RSV genes showed higher RNA levels in the rice plants consumed by these planthoppers, leading to a higher viral infection rate and disease rating index. These results indicate that LsACE plays a role in the immune response against RSV transmission by planthoppers.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xue; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Wenzhong; Li, Jing; Cui, Feng; Qiao, Luqin","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42085d63b0fbfc03c555626cadd11d55774c5c64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127076.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.05.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682219301278; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219301278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247402/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACE","RSV","RSV SP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV infection","expression of LsACE","upregulated LsACE expression","RSV genes","RSV transmission","RSV SP gene","enzymatic activities of LsACE","ACE gene","viruliferous planthoppers","higher viral infection rate","higher RNA levels","immune function","immune response","rice plants","planthopper proteins","Rice stripe virus","small brown planthopper","disease rating index","vector insects","diverse roles","enzyme","testicle","fold","different pH","fat body","animal kingdom","Abstract Angiotensin","study","temperature","results"],"language":"en"},

The use of model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium (MELD-Na) with physiological indicators can be used to assess severity and differentiate therapeutic interventions. This study is aimed to determine the mean survival period and cumulative survival rate by classifying patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on MELD-Na, a predictor of mortality in liver disease, and to investigate the mortality prognostic factors. A retrospective cohort study, which follows the STROBE checklist, was performed. 263 patients who were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis complications for the first time and hospitalized were selected as the subjects of this study. The collected data were analyzed based on the survival package provided by the statistical program R version 3.4.2. Subjects were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups using MELD-Na 14 points where sensitivity and specificity crossed the cut-off point. Gender, age, and primary caregiver were significant variables in the mortality high-risk group, and AST, albumin, and primary caregiver were significant variables in the mortality low-risk group. Based on these mortality prognostic factors, it is possible to present the factors affecting mortality in patients who were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis complications for the first time. The classification of patients by risk level could be the foundation to provide accurate guidelines for management and it is necessary to modify prognostic factors and apply nursing interventions to manage complications.","publish_time":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yuna; Kim, Kyunghee; Jang, Insil","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62219dc0553022e4faac2b1523e7e0a2d1eaec30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6855481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6855481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mortality prognostic factors","mortality low-risk group","mortality high-risk group","predictor of mortality","liver cirrhosis complications","MELD-Na","low-risk groups","classification of patients","time","risk level","significant variables","primary caregiver","end-stage liver disease","survival package","management","progression of cirrhosis","subjects","cumulative survival rate","mean survival period","retrospective cohort study","quality of life","expectation of life","nursing interventions","therapeutic interventions","incorporation of serum","sensitivity","albumin","AST","specificity","foundation","points","sodium","statistical program R version","use of model","enhancement","treatment","accurate guidelines","physiological indicators","cut-off point","severity","Gender","STROBE checklist","collected data"],"language":"en"},

Four species-specific anti-IgY secondary antibodies were used in the assays: goat anti-macaw IgY, goat anti-bird IgY, goat anti-duck IgY, and rabbit anti-chicken IgY. RESULTS: In the Western blot, anti-macaw IgY secondary antibody produced strong signals with Blue and gold macaw and Cockatiel positive plasma, but no signal with Mallard positive plasma. Anti-bird IgY secondary antibody produced strong signals with Blue and gold macaw, Cockatiel, and Mallard positive plasma. Anti-duck and anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody produced a strong and moderate signal, respectively, only with Mallard positive plasma.

We conducted an observational study in five Peruvian ICUs to characterize differences between ARDS at MV onset and after MV onset and identify risk factors for the development of ARDS after MV onset. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure requiring at least 24 h of mechanical ventilation and followed them prospectively during the first 28 days and compared baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes by ARDS status. RESULTS: We enrolled 1657 participants on MV (mean age 60.0 years, 55% males) of whom 334 (20.2%) had ARDS at MV onset and 180 (10.9%) developed ARDS after MV onset. Average tidal volume at the initiation of MV was 8.7 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) for participants with ARDS at MV onset, 8.6 mL/kg PBW for those who developed ARDS after MV onset, and 8.5 mL/kg PBW for those who never developed ARDS (p = 0.23). Overall, 90-day mortality was 56% and 55% for ARDS after MV onset and ARDS at MV onset, respectively, as compared to 46% among those who never developed ARDS (p \u003C 0.01). Adults with ARDS had a higher body mass index (BMI) than those without ARDS (27.3 vs 26.5 kg/m(2), p \u003C 0.01). Higher peak pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.21\u20131.88), higher mean airway pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.13\u20131.76), and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.10\u20131.50) at MV onset were associated with a higher odds of developing ARDS after MV onset. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of mechanically ventilated patients, 31% of study participants had ARDS at some point during their ICU stay. Optimal lung-protective ventilation was not used in a majority of patients. Patients with ARDS after MV onset had a similar 90-day mortality as those with ARDS at MV onset. Higher airway pressures at MV onset, higher PEEP, and higher BMI were associated with the development of ARDS after MV onset.","publish_time":"2019-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Ena; Hossen, Shakir; Grigsby, Matthew R.; Herrera, Phabiola; Roldan, Rollin; Paz, Enrique; Jaymez, Amador A.; Chirinos, Eduardo E.; Portugal, Jose; Quispe, Rocio; Brower, Roy G.; Checkley, William","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/772046ceb62525b9f5c685e2d2b8dd33573107ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6898929.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6898929/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","MV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MV onset","development of ARDS","initiation of MV","ARDS status","course of MV","higher odds of developing ARDS","higher BMI","higher PEEP","Higher peak pressure","higher mean airway pressure","Higher airway pressures","higher body mass index","study participants","PBW","higher positive end-expiratory pressure","ill patients","ventilated patients","majority of patients","initiation of mechanical ventilation","h of mechanical ventilation","observational study","day mortality","acute respiratory failure","epidemiological differences","acute respiratory distress syndrome","clinical outcomes","mean age","Optimal lung-protective ventilation","predicted body weight","baseline characteristics","Peruvian ICUs","risk factors","years","point","Average tidal volume","days","BACKGROUND","Adults","males","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","vs"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Prospective data was collected on all patients admitted to a multi-disciplinary ICU in South Africa during 2017. Development of AKI (before or during ICU admission) was recorded and renal recovery 90 days after ICU discharge was determined. RESULTS: Of 849 admissions, the mean age was 42.5 years and mean SAPS 3 score was 48.1. Comorbidities included hypertension (30.5%), HIV (32.6%), diabetes (13.3%), CKD (7.8%) and active tuberculosis (6.2%). The most common reason for admission was trauma (26%). AKI developed in 497 (58.5%). Male gender, illness severity, length of stay, vasopressor drugs and sepsis were independently associated with AKI. AKI was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate of 31.8% vs 7.23% in those without AKI. Age, active tuberculosis, higher SAPS 3 score, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support and sepsis were associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio for death. HIV was not independently associated with AKI or hospital mortality. CKD developed in 14 of 110 (12.7%) patients with stage 3 AKI; none were dialysis-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective multidisciplinary ICU cohort of younger patients, AKI was common, often associated with trauma in addition to traditional risk factors and was associated with good functional renal recovery at 90 days in most survivors. Although the HIV prevalence was high and associated with higher mortality, this was related to the severity of illness and not to HIV status per se.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aylward, Ryan E.; van der Merwe, Elizabeth; Pazi, Sisa; van Niekerk, Minette; Ensor, Jason; Baker, Debbie; Freercks, Robert J.","journal":"BMC Nephrol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f272071ba1d16200a998e407994e66be0f0d60d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6902455.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6902455/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzU30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AKI","ICU","SAPS","CKD"],"locations":["Sub-Saharan Africa","South Africa"],"keyphrases":["Development of AKI","ICU admission","higher mortality","HIV prevalence","HIV status","higher SAPS","ICU discharge","score","sepsis","mean SAPS","multi-disciplinary ICU","Prospective data","days","mean age","illness severity","severity of illness","active tuberculosis","hospital mortality rate","CKD","large prospective multidisciplinary ICU cohort of younger patients","substantial burden of trauma","good functional renal recovery","vasopressor support","vasopressor drugs","South Africa","common reason","marked paucity of data","Sub-Saharan Africa","mechanical ventilation","length of stay","traditional risk factors","years","increased adjusted odds ratio","death","addition","Male gender","vs","CONCLUSIONS","admissions","stage","dialysis-dependent","BACKGROUND","METHODS","survivors","hypertension","diabetes","Comorbidities","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge of the spatial and temporal characteristics of influenza is important in evaluating and developing disease control programs. This study aims to describe an accurate spatiotemporal pattern of influenza at the prefecture level and explore the risk factors associated with influenza incidence risk in mainland China from 2005 to 2018. The incidence data of influenza were obtained from the Chinese Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System (CNIDRS). The Besag York Molli\u00E9 (BYM) model was extended to include temporal and space-time interaction terms. The parameters for this extended Bayesian spatiotemporal model were estimated through integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) using the package R-INLA in R. A total of 702,226 influenza cases were reported in mainland China in CNIDRS from 2005\u20132018. The yearly reported incidence rate of influenza increased 15.6 times over the study period, from 3.51 in 2005 to 55.09 in 2008 per 100,000 populations. The temporal term in the spatiotemporal model showed that much of the increase occurred during the last 3 years of the study period. The risk factor analysis showed that the decreased number of influenza vaccines for sale, the new update of the influenza surveillance protocol, the increase in the rate of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 among all processed specimens from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients, and the increase in the latitude and longitude of geographic location were associated with an increase in the influenza incidence risk. After the adjusting for fixed covariate effects and time random effects, the map of the spatial structured term shows that high-risk areas clustered in the central part of China and the lowest-risk areas in the east and west. Large space-time variations in influenza have been found since 2009. In conclusion, an increasing trend of influenza was observed from 2005 to 2018. The insufficient flu vaccine supplements, the newly emerging influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and expansion of influenza surveillance efforts might be the major causes of the dramatic changes in outbreak and spatio-temporal epidemic patterns. Clusters of prefectures with high relative risks of influenza were identified in the central part of China. Future research with more risk factors at both national and local levels is necessary to explain the changing spatiotemporal patterns of influenza in China.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yewu; Wang, Xiaofeng; Li, Yanfei; Ma, Jiaqi","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/923e7880617bb92ca8390ab8b8adb43ec8b147b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6928232.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928232/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozg10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["emerging influenza","influenza cases","influenza incidence risk","temporal characteristics of influenza","incidence data of influenza","influenza surveillance protocol","increasing trend of influenza","changing spatiotemporal patterns of influenza","accurate spatiotemporal pattern of influenza","expansion of influenza surveillance efforts","yearly reported incidence rate of influenza","decreased number of influenza vaccines","high relative risks of influenza","risk factors","increase","mainland China","lowest-risk areas","temporal term","risk factor analysis","extended Bayesian spatiotemporal model","study period","pdm09","H1N1","spatio-temporal epidemic patterns","CNIDRS","spatial structured term","major causes","high-risk areas","time random effects","fixed covariate effects","major cause of morbidity","package R-INLA","disease control programs","space-time interaction terms","Large space-time variations","Chinese Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System","outbreak","new update","map","sale","integrated nested Laplace approximations","dramatic changes","prefecture level","local levels","illness","processed specimens","times","Clusters of prefectures","insufficient flu vaccine supplements","adjusting","Besag York Molli\u00E9","BYM","latitude","longitude of geographic location","east","total","parameters","ILI","mortality","patients","Knowledge","conclusion","Future research","years","populations"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to map global clinical research publication activity through RCT-related articles in high-impact-factor medical journals over the past five decades. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of articles published in the highest ranked medical journals with an impact factor \u003E 10 (according to Journal Citation Reports published in 2017). We searched PubMed/MEDLINE (from inception to December 31, 2017) for all RCT-related articles (e.g. primary RCTs, secondary analyses and methodology papers) published in high-impact-factor medical journals. For each included article, raw metadata were abstracted from the Web of Science. A process of standardization was conducted to unify the different terms and grammatical variants and to remove typographical, transcription and/or indexing errors. Descriptive analyses were conducted (including the number of articles, citations, most prolific authors, countries, journals, funding sources and keywords). Network analyses of collaborations between countries and co-words are presented. RESULTS: We included 39,305 articles (for the period 1965\u20132017) published in forty journals. The Lancet (n = 3593; 9.1%), the Journal of Clinical Oncology (n = 3343; 8.5%) and The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 3275 articles; 8.3%) published the largest number of RCTs. A total of 154 countries were involved in the production of articles. The global productivity ranking was led by the United States (n = 18,393 articles), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 8028 articles), Canada (n = 4548 articles) and Germany (n = 4415 articles). Seventeen authors who had published 100 or more articles were identified; the most prolific authors were affiliated with Duke University (United States), Harvard University (United States) and McMaster University (Canada). The main funding institutions were the National Institutes of Health (United States), Hoffmann-La Roche (Switzerland), Pfizer (United States), Merck Sharp \u0026 Dohme (United States) and Novartis (Switzerland). The 100 most cited RCTs were published in nine journals, led by The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 78 articles), The Lancet (n = 9 articles) and JAMA (n = 7 articles). These landmark contributions focused on novel methodological approaches (e.g. the \u201CBland-Altman method\u201D) and trials on the management of chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes control, hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, multiple therapies for diverse cancers, cardiovascular therapies such as lipid-lowering statins, antihypertensive medications, and antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis identified authors, countries, funding institutions, landmark contributions and high-impact-factor medical journals publishing RCTs. Over the last 50 years, publication production in leading medical journals has increased, with Western countries leading in research but with low- and middle-income countries showing very limited representation.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Catal\u00E1-L\u00F3pez, Ferr\u00E1n; Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael; Caulley, Lisa; Hutton, Brian; Tabar\u00E9s-Seisdedos, Rafael; Moher, David; Alonso-Arroyo, Adolfo","journal":"Trials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19072f6c5d5ce2f05bf0dc205d889b6ead14bd9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6947860.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947860/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzEyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Journal Citation","Lancet","Journal of Clinical Oncology","The New England Journal of Medicine","Duke University","Harvard University","McMaster University","National Institutes of Health","Pfizer","Merck Sharp \u0026 Dohme"],"locations":["United States","United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["production of articles","number of articles","United States","RCT-related articles","cross-sectional analysis of articles","factor medical journals","leading medical journals","impact factor","United Kingdom","highest ranked medical journals","high-impact","middle-income countries","Western countries","primary RCTs","cited RCTs","prolific authors","Journal of Clinical Oncology","largest number of RCTs","New England Journal of Medicine","Harvard University","landmark contributions","main funding institutions","McMaster University","Duke University","funding sources","global clinical research publication activity","publication production","clinical practice","secondary analyses","Switzerland","Canada","Descriptive analyses","Journal Citation Reports","Lancet","Network analyses of collaborations","multiple therapies","cardiovascular therapies","antithrombotic therapy","included article","hormone replacement therapy","Randomised controlled trials","global productivity ranking","postmenopausal women","diabetes control","diverse cancers","National Institutes of Health","Merck Sharp","lipid","methodology papers","Dohme","antihypertensive medications","management of chronic conditions","statins","Hoffmann","Pfizer","citations","novel methodological approaches","grammatical variants","reliable information","raw metadata","BACKGROUND","Roche","years","Novartis","different terms","Germany","JAMA","patient care","co-words","Bland-Altman method","transcription","limited representation","keywords","decades","PubMed","MEDLINE","inception","Web of Science","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","process of standardization","errors","total","RESULTS","period"],"language":"en"},

Sepsis consequently has a high mortality rate and a high rate of complications for survivors, despite modern medical advances. Therefore, drug identification and validation for the treatment of sepsis is of the utmost importance. As a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, rolipram also exhibits the abilities of inhibiting multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines production in macrophages and toxin-induced inflammation in mice. However, this drug has never been studied as a sepsis treatment method. We found that rolipram significantly improves survival in mice challenged with gram-negative bacterium E. coli, CLP, or E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide. We have also found that rolipram inhibits organ damage, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and intracellular migration of early-stage inflammatory elements. Our results also show that rolipram increases anti-inflammatory cytokine production. The protective effects of rolipram on septic mice may result from inhibition of the MAP kinase and NF-\u03BAB signaling pathways. Rolipram may therefore be a potential novel sepsis treatment, one that would bypass the time-consuming and costly drug-discovery process.","publish_time":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Xiaying; Wang, Juan; Chen, Xiaohuan; Jiang, Yong; Pan, Zhixing K.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3152d3983f750480f7dbf45004158604ed00913e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6957694.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6957694/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of sepsis","sepsis treatment method","pro-inflammatory cytokine production","protective effects of rolipram","potential novel sepsis treatment","multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines production","stage inflammatory elements","anti-inflammatory cytokine production","septic mice","drug identification","overwhelming systemic inflammatory response","high rate of complications","high mortality rate","organ damage","costly drug-discovery process","severe organ dysfunction","coli derived lipopolysaccharide","macrophages","intracellular migration of early","CLP","survivors","abilities","toxin-induced inflammation","inhibition","pathogens","gram-negative bacterium","NF-\u03BAB","MAP kinase","inhibitor","survival","validation","modern medical advances","pathways","death","selective phosphodiesterase","utmost importance","results"],"language":"en"},

However, multiple invasion-related genes with complementary and overlapping functions afford the parasite the plasticity to vary ligands used for invasion, leading to phenotypic variation and immune evasion. Overcoming the challenge posed by redundant ligands requires a deeper understanding of conditions that select for variant phenotypes and the molecular mediators. While host factors including receptor heterogeneity and acquired immune responses may drive parasite phenotypic variation, we have previously shown that host-independent changes in invasion phenotype can be achieved by continuous culturing of the W2mef and Dd2 P. falciparum strains in moving suspension as opposed to static conditions. Here, we have used a highly biologically replicated whole transcriptome sequencing approach to identify the molecular signatures of variation associated with the phenotype switch. The data show increased expression of particular invasion-related genes in switched parasites, as well as a large number of genes encoding proteins that are either exported or form part of the export machinery. The genes with most markedly increased expression included members of the erythrocyte binding antigens (EBA), reticulocyte binding homologues (RH), surface associated interspersed proteins (SURFIN), exported protein family 1 (EPF1) and Plasmodium Helical Interspersed Sub-Telomeric (PHIST) gene families. The data indicate changes in expression of a repertoire of genes not previously associated with erythrocyte invasion phenotypes, suggesting the possibility that moving suspension culture may also select for other traits.","publish_time":"2020-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nyarko, Prince B.; Tarr, Sarah J.; Aniweh, Yaw; Stewart, Lindsay B.; Conway, David J.; Awandare, Gordon A.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/187ef9b17adf4f15988cbedfe08856bf225c16b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6959351.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6959351/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["erythrocyte invasion phenotypes","multiple invasion-related genes","increased expression of particular invasion-related genes","repertoire of genes","parasite phenotypic variation","large number of genes","erythrocyte binding antigens","surface associated interspersed proteins","molecular signatures of variation","moving suspension","data","Plasmodium falciparum survival","host-independent changes","falciparum strains","immune responses","immune evasion","redundant ligands","variant phenotypes","suspension culture","molecular mediators","host factors","static conditions","phenotype switch","Plasmodium Helical Interspersed Sub-Telomeric","reticulocyte binding homologues","deeper understanding of conditions","PHIST","Dd2","RH","attractive target","process","EPF1","reproduction","SURFIN","EBA","W2mef","receptor heterogeneity","functions","members","switched parasites","possibility","gene families","continuous culturing","vaccine development","protein family","plasticity","transcriptome sequencing approach","central role","form","export machinery","challenge","traits"],"language":"en"},

Bone is the most common first site of metastatic disease accounting for 40% of all first recurrence and 70% of patients with advanced disease develop skeletal involvement. Treatment of bone metastases currently focusses on symptom relief and prevention and treatment of skeletal complications. However, there remains a need for further treatment options for patients with bone metastases. Combining systemic therapy with a bone-targeted agent, such as radium-223, may provide an effective treatment with minimal additional side effects. METHODS/DESIGN: CARBON is a UK-based, open-label, multi-centre study which comprises an initial safety phase to establish the feasibility and safety of combining radium-223 given on a 6-weekly schedule in combination with orally administered capecitabine followed by a randomised extension phase to further characterise the safety profile and provide preliminary estimation of efficacy. DISCUSSION: The CARBON study is important as the results will be the first to assess radium-223 with chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer.

To prevent the occurrence of medication errors in clinical practice, safety concerns may be included in the risk management plan and subsequently be addressed with routine and/or additional risk minimisation measures. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe safety concerns around medication errors and the risk minimisation measures for centrally authorised products in the European Union. METHODS: All safety concerns included in the risk management plans of originator centrally authorised products, authorised between 1 January, 2010 and 31 December, 2017, were collected from the European Public Assessment Report registry. Medication error safety concerns were categorised by Anatomical Therapeutic Classification code, year of authorisation, type of medication error and type of risk minimisation measure. RESULTS: During the study period, 311 centrally authorised products were approved, of which 84 had at least one medication error safety concern. The proportion of centrally authorised products with medication error safety concerns showed variation between 2010 and 2017 ranging from 15.2% to 36.4%. In total, 95 medication error safety concerns were identified. The type of medication error was highly variable, drug administration error was listed most frequently (n = 17). For 27 out of 95 medication error safety concerns, corresponding to 23 centrally authorised products, additional risk minimisation measures were required. All additional risk minimisation measures consisted of educational material targeted at healthcare professionals (85.2%) and/or patients (51.9%). For 78.3% of centrally authorised products with additional risk minimisation measures for medication errors, studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the additional risk minimisation measures were agreed upon. CONCLUSIONS: Medication error safety concerns were listed for almost a quarter of centrally authorised products approved during the study period. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and continued need for additional risk minimisation measures for medication errors.

Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or carbapenemases are considered global priority pathogens for which new treatment and prevention strategies are urgently required, due to severely limited therapeutic options. South and Southeast Asia are major hubs for antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) K. pneumoniae and also for the characteristically antimicrobial-sensitive, community-acquired \u201Chypervirulent\u201D strains. The emergence of hypervirulent AMR strains and lack of data on exopolysaccharide diversity pose a challenge for K. pneumoniae BSI control strategies worldwide. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective genomic epidemiology study of 365 BSI K. pneumoniae from seven major healthcare facilities across South and Southeast Asia, extracting clinically relevant information (AMR, virulence, K and O antigen loci) using Kleborate, a K. pneumoniae-specific genomic typing tool. RESULTS: K. pneumoniae BSI isolates were highly diverse, comprising 120 multi-locus sequence types (STs) and 63 K-loci. ESBL and carbapenemase gene frequencies were 47% and 17%, respectively. The aerobactin synthesis locus (iuc), associated with hypervirulence, was detected in 28% of isolates. Importantly, 7% of isolates harboured iuc plus ESBL and/or carbapenemase genes. The latter represent genotypic AMR-virulence convergence, which is generally considered a rare phenomenon but was particularly common among South Asian BSI (17%). Of greatest concern, we identified seven novel plasmids carrying both iuc and AMR genes, raising the prospect of co-transfer of these phenotypes among K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumoniae BSI in South and Southeast Asia are caused by different STs from those predominating in other regions, and with higher frequency of acquired virulence determinants. K. pneumoniae carrying both iuc and AMR genes were also detected at higher rates than have been reported elsewhere. The study demonstrates how genomics-based surveillance\u2014reporting full molecular profiles including STs, AMR, virulence and serotype locus information\u2014can help standardise comparisons between sites and identify regional differences in pathogen populations.

This observation supported the importance of non-coding RNAs and it was confirmed in several organisms. The most abundant non-translated transcripts are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In contrast to protein-coding RNAs, they show a more cell-specific expression. To understand the function of lncRNAs, it is fundamental to investigate in which cells they are preferentially expressed and to detect their subcellular localization. Recent improvements of techniques that localize single RNA molecules in tissues like single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescence amplification methods have given a considerable boost in the knowledge of the lncRNA functions. In recent years, single-cell transcription variability was associated with non-coding RNA expression, revealing this class of RNAs as important transcripts in the cell lineage specification. The purpose of this review is to collect updated information about lncRNA classification and new findings on their function derived from single-cell analysis.

However, new studies have provided evidence contradicting these results. METHOD: A search was performed of the Pubmed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Virtual Health Library databases for randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating 28-day mortality in ARDS patients treated with NMBA within 48 h. An English language restriction was applied. Relevant data were extracted and pooled into risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effect model. Sensitivity and meta-regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: From 2675 studies, we included five RCTs in the analysis, for a total of 1461 patients with a mean PaO(2)/FIO(2) of 104 \u00B1 35 mmHg. The cisatracurium group had the same risk of death at 28 days (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78\u20131.03; I(2) = 50%, p = 0.12) and 90 days (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62\u20131.06; I(2) = 56%, p = 0.06) as the control group (no cisatracurium). The secondary outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration and ventilator-free days were not different between the two groups. Cisatracurium had a significantly lower risk of barotrauma than the control group with no difference in intensive care unit (ICU)\u2013induced weakness. The PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was higher in the cisatracurium group but not until 48 h. Meta-regression analysis of the baseline PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) revealed no heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis excluding the trial using high PEEP and light sedation strategy yielded an improvement in all mortality outcomes. CONCLUSION: NMBA improves oxygenation only after 48 h in moderate, severe ARDS patients and has a lower barotrauma risk without affecting ICU weakness. However, NMBA does not reduce ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation or, most importantly, the mortality risk regardless of the severity of ARDS.","publish_time":"2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, An Thi Nhat; Patolia, Setu; Guervilly, Christophe","journal":"J Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38ecb82f2923398591b9aeac2ce60acb41881a26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6986163.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6986163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Clinicaltrials.gov","ARDS","NMBA","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mortality risk","NMBA","cisatracurium group","severe ARDS patients","lower barotrauma risk","lower risk of barotrauma","risk ratios","risk of death","control group","RR","FIO","ventilator-free days","meta-regression analysis","severity of ARDS","mean PaO","mortality outcomes","Subgroup analysis","duration of mechanical ventilation","ICU weakness","day mortality","baseline PaO","results","secondary outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration","high PEEP","mean differences","induced weakness","new studies","early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","randomized controlled trials","Virtual Health Library databases","light sedation strategy","medical guidelines","intensive care unit","positive end-expiratory pressure","improvement","confidence intervals","BACKGROUND","Neuromuscular blocking agent","oxygenation","MD","random-effect model","Scopus","evidence","Sensitivity","total","English language restriction","survival benefits","search","Pubmed","heterogeneity","CONCLUSION","RCTs","Relevant data","METHOD","groups","mmHg"],"language":"en"},

Other cytosolic pathogens block different steps of autophagy targeting, including the initial step of polyubiquitin coat formation. One mechanism of evasion is to mobilize actin to the bacterial surface. Here, we show that actin mobilization is insufficient to block autophagy recognition of the pathogen Rickettsia parkeri. Instead, R. parkeri employs outer membrane protein B (OmpB) to block ubiquitylation of bacterial surface proteins, including OmpA, and subsequent recognition by autophagy receptors. OmpB is also required for the formation of a capsule-like layer. Although OmpB is dispensable for bacterial growth in endothelial cells, it is essential for R. parkeri to block autophagy in macrophages and to colonize mice because of its ability to promote autophagy evasion in immune cells. Our results indicate that OmpB acts as a protective shield to obstruct autophagy recognition, revealing a distinctive bacterial mechanism to evade antimicrobial autophagy.","publish_time":"2019-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Engstr\u00F6m, Patrik; Burke, Thomas P.; Mitchell, Gabriel; Ingabire, Nadia; Mark, Kevin G.; Golovkine, Guillaume; Iavarone, Anthony T.; Rape, Michael; Cox, Jeffery S.; Welch, Matthew D.","journal":"Nat Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10218d6165dcbaa34d75f2135348cbac1ffc9ec9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6988571.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988571/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autophagy recognition","antimicrobial autophagy","autophagy evasion","autophagy receptors","different steps of autophagy","bacterial growth","OmpB acts","distinctive bacterial mechanism","subsequent recognition","ubiquitylation of bacterial surface proteins","pathogen Rickettsia parkeri","mechanism of evasion","endothelial cells","immune cells","actin mobilization","initial step of polyubiquitin coat formation","host cell cytosol","OmpA","outer membrane protein B","protective shield","unknown mechanisms","cytosolic pathogens","ability","intracellular bacteria","mice","macrophages","capsule","layer","results"],"language":"en"},

Here we analyze modification of the vitamin C effect on ventilation time, by the control group ventilation time (which we used as a proxy for severity of disease in the patients of each trial). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and reference lists of relevant publications. We included controlled trials in which the administration of vitamin C was the only difference between the study groups. We did not limit our search to randomized trials and did not require placebo control. We included all doses and all durations of vitamin C administration. One author extracted study characteristics and outcomes from the trial reports and entered the data in a spreadsheet. Both authors checked the data entered against the original reports. We used meta-regression to examine whether the vitamin C effect on ventilation time depends on the duration of ventilation in the control group. RESULTS: We identified nine potentially eligible trials, eight of which were included in the meta-analysis. We pooled the results of the eight trials, including 685 patients in total, and found that vitamin C shortened the length of mechanical ventilation on average by 14% (P = 0.00001). However, there was significant heterogeneity in the effect of vitamin C between the trials. Heterogeneity was fully explained by the ventilation time in the untreated control group. Vitamin C was most beneficial for patients with the longest ventilation, corresponding to the most severely ill patients. In five trials including 471 patients requiring ventilation for over 10 h, a dosage of 1\u20136 g/day of vitamin C shortened ventilation time on average by 25% (P \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We found strong evidence that vitamin C shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation, but the magnitude of the effect seems to depend on the duration of ventilation in the untreated control group. The level of baseline illness severity should be considered in further research. Different doses should be compared directly in future trials.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hemil\u00E4, Harri; Chalker, Elizabeth","journal":"J Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55d762875ac9c5b43832336f3a88d0e70ff8ab9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7006137.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7006137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of vitamin C","vitamin C effect","duration of ventilation","administration of vitamin C","day of vitamin C shortened ventilation time","control group ventilation time","longest ventilation","duration of mechanical ventilation","durations of vitamin C administration","length of mechanical ventilation","eligible trials","future trials","untreated control group","placebo control","ill patients","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","average","trial reports","recent meta-analysis","data","meta-regression","RESULTS","length of ICU","study characteristics","severity of disease","study groups","original reports","significant heterogeneity","Different doses","level of baseline illness severity","reference lists of relevant publications","Scopus","outcomes","strong evidence","difference","total","MEDLINE","BACKGROUND","magnitude","modification","METHODS","dosage","CONCLUSIONS","proxy","spreadsheet","authors","research"],"language":"en"},

These patients place a strain on health care systems and health care professionals (HCPs). Presently, we aimed to systematically review the literature on HCPs\u2019 experiences working with patients with long-term chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHOD: A systematic search of papers published between 2002 and July 2019 was conducted in the Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and COCHRANE databases to identify studies reporting qualitative interviews addressing HCPs\u2019 experiences working with adults with COPD, CKD or type 2 diabetes. An interdisciplinary research group were involved in all phases of the study. With the help of NVivo, extracts of each paper were coded, and codes were compared across papers and refined using translational analysis. Further codes were clustered in categories that in turn formed overarching themes. RESULTS: Our comprehensive search identified 4170 citations. Of these, 20 papers met our inclusion criteria. Regarding HCPs\u2019 experiences working with patients with COPD, CKD, or type 2 diabetes, we developed 10 sub-categories that formed three overarching main themes of work experiences: 1) individualizing one\u2019s professional approach within the clinical encounter; 2) managing one\u2019s emotions over time; 3) working to maintain professionalism. Overall these three themes suggest that HCPs\u2019 work is a complex balancing act depending on the interaction between patient and professional, reality and professional ideals, and contextual support and managing one\u2019s own emotions. CONCLUSION: Few qualitative studies highlighted HCPs\u2019 general working experiences, as they mainly focused on the patients\u2019 experiences or HCPs\u2019 experiences of using particular clinical procedures. This study brings new insights about the complexity embedded in HCPs\u2019 work in terms of weighing different, often contrasting aspects, in order to deliver appropriate practice. Acknowledging, discussing and supporting this complexity can empower HCPs to avoid burning out. Leaders, health organizations, and educational institutions have a particular responsibility to provide HCPs with thorough professional knowledge and systematic support.

A deeper understanding of PEDV attenuation will aid in the rational design of a live attenuated vaccine (LAV) using reverse genetics system. Our results showed that replacing the S gene from the highly virulent iPEDVPT-P5 led to complete restoration of virulence of the attenuated iPEDVPT-P96, with nearly identical viral shedding, diarrhea pattern, and mortality rate as the parental iPEDVPT-P5. In contrast, substitution of the S gene with that from the attenuated iPEDVPT-P96 resulted in partial attenuation of iPEDVPT-P5, exhibiting similar viral shedding and diarrhea patterns as the parental iPEDVPT-P96 with slightly severe histological lesions and higher mortality rate. Collectively, our data confirmed that the attenuation of the PEDVPT-P96 virus is primarily attributed to mutations in the S gene.

Although HTLV-2 is not usually pathogenic, it is widely distributed among native Indian populations in Brazil, particularly in the Amazon region of the country. Presently, HTLV spreads mainly by the sexual route and from mother to child, and virus persistence is an active biological factor aiding its transmission. Recently, the use of illicit drugs has been shown to be an additional risk factor, showing the influence of new habits on the epidemiology of HTLV in the region. Despite the detection of the virus in several different populations in the Amazon region of Brazil for almost 30 years, the exact prevalence of HTLV-1/2 is not well defined. The original biases in sampling and the selection of epidemiologically unsuitable populations were commonly repeated in most prevalence studies, generating unreliable and conflicting figures that do not represent the actual prevalence of HTLV. The improvements in clinical and laboratory facilities have resulted in the description of several clinical manifestations that were previously unknown in the region. The extent of the spread of the virus must be defined in this region, which is the largest geographical area of the country.

However, it is not approved for mucosal application in Japan. The aims of this study were to investigate if topical povidone iodine (i) inhibits bacterial growth and (ii) disrupts the balance of the oral microbiota. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial included 23 patients who underwent mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. The patients were divided randomly into two groups: the intervention group (n = 16) and the control group (n = 7). All patients received oral cleaning with 3% hydrogen peroxide, followed by irrigation with tap water. The patients in the intervention group received 10% povidone iodine applied topically to the oral cavity. The concentration of total bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid were determined before, immediately after, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after oral care using the Rapid Oral Bacteria Quantification System, which is based on dielectrophoresis and impedance measurements. The number of streptococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans before, immediately after, 1 h, and 3 h after oral care were estimated based on real-time polymerase chain reaction data. RESULTS: After irrigation of the oral cavity, the number of bacteria decreased, but increased again at 1 h after oral care in the control group; however, in the intervention group, the concentration of bacteria was significantly lower than that in the control group at 1 hour (p = 0.009), 2 h (p = 0.001), and 3 h (p = 0.001) after oral care. The growth of all bacterial species tested was inhibited in the intervention group at 3 h after oral care, suggesting that povidone iodine did not disturb the balance of the oral microbiota.

A postal questionnaire survey was conducted to explore the self-perceived pandemic preparedness of GPs in the West Midlands, United Kingdom, and to determine differences between urban and non-urban GPs. The postal questionnaire was sent out to 773 GPs in November 2005, and a reminder was sent in January 2006. In all, 427/773 (55%) questionnaires were returned, and 56% of respondents were aware of influenza pandemic preparedness plans. Approximately one-quarter of respondents (28%, 114/401) thought the response of their practice to a pandemic event would be very poor/poor. Non-urban GPs were significantly more likely to rate the response of their practice to a pandemic as likely to be poor (OR 3.01, 95%CI 1.03\u20138.76) and were less likely to be aware of pandemic preparedness plans (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.39\u20130.99). Non-urban GPs were also significantly more likely to feel less confident in their ability to explain to their patients what to do and why during an influenza pandemic than GPs based in urban areas (OR 4.68, 95%CI 1.78\u201312.31). GPs rating of the odds of a pandemic affecting the United Kingdom did not differ significantly by geographic location. The results of this paper can be used to inform and influence public health policy and as evidence of a need to provide additional education and training to improve pandemic preparedness among GPs, in particular those in non-urban areas.","publish_time":"2007-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beaumont, M.; Duggal, H.

In the climate change context, such societal teleconnections add a layer of risk that is currently neither fully appreciated in most impacts or vulnerability assessments nor in on-the-ground adaptation planning. Conceptually, societal teleconnections arise from the interactions among actors, and the institutions that guide their actions, affecting the movement of various substances through different structures and processes. Empirically, they arise out of societal interactions, including globalization, to create, amplify, and sometimes attenuate climate change vulnerabilities and impacts in regions far from those where a climatic extreme or change occurs. This paper introduces a simple but systematic way to conceptualize societal teleconnections and then highlights and explores eight unique but interrelated types of societal teleconnections with selected examples: (1) trade and economic exchange, (2) insurance and reinsurance, (3) energy systems, (4) food systems; (5) human health, (6) population migration, (7) communication, and (8) strategic alliances and military interactions. The paper encourages further research to better understand the causal chains behind socially teleconnected impacts, and to identify ways to routinely integrate their consideration in impacts/vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning to limit the risk of costly impacts.

Endothelial cells may act as a target of the virus and be involved in disease pathogenesis. Therefore, the identification of host cell components involved in DENV replication would provide useful information for better understanding DENV infection. In this study, a significantly decreased level of miR-223 was found in DENV2-infected EAhy926 cells, a human endothelial-like cell line, whereas miR-223 overexpression inhibited DENV2 replication. Furthermore, we identified that miR-223 directly targeted the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of the messenger RNA (mRNA) for microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin 1 (STMN1), thereby reducing its mRNA and protein levels. The depletion of miR-223 or overexpression of STMN1 enhanced DENV2 replication, whereas the opposite (increased miR-223 or decreased STMN1) suppressed DENV2 replication, indicating that miR-223 down-regulates STMN1 expression by targeting the 3\u2032UTR of the STMN1 gene to inhibit DENV2 replication. Finally, we demonstrated that two transcription factors, C/EBP\u03B1 and E2F1, are involved in the regulation of miR-223 levels after DENV2 infection in EAhy926 cells. Collectively, our results suggest that miR-223 may act as a novel antiviral factor, which may open an avenue to limit DENV infection.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Na; Gao, Na; Fan, Dongying; Wei, Jianchun; Zhang, Jing; An, Jing","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9618ed717697f4aa77f65da0baada1f304a5d919.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110837.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457914001269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25181337/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2014.08.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457914001269","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV2 infection","DENV replication","increased miR","regulation of miR","level of miR","depletion of miR","overexpression of STMN1 enhanced DENV2 replication","overexpression inhibited DENV2 replication","decreased STMN1","DENV2-infected EAhy926 cells","STMN1 gene","STMN1 expression","better understanding DENV infection","Endothelial cells","mRNA","protein levels","UTR","pathogenesis of dengue virus","cell line","disease pathogenesis","microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin","identification of host cell components","useful information","opposite","EBP\u03B1","E2F1","messenger RNA","transcription factors","target","avenue","novel antiviral factor","untranslated region","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Zoonotic disease organisms include those that are endemic in human populations or enzootic in animal populations with frequent cross-species transmission to people.

Together, these organisms are responsible for a substantial burden of disease, with endemic and enzootic zoonoses causing about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year. Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of US dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years. We aimed to review how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology, and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings. In view of present anthropogenic trends, a more effective approach to zoonotic disease prevention and control will require a broad view of medicine that emphasises evidence-based decision making and integrates ecological and evolutionary principles of animal, human, and environmental factors. This broad view is essential for the successful development of policies and practices that reduce probability of future zoonotic emergence, targeted surveillance and strategic prevention, and engagement of partners outside the medical community to help improve health outcomes and reduce disease threats.","publish_time":"2012-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karesh, William B; Dobson, Andy; Lloyd-Smith, James O; Lubroth, Juan; Dixon, Matthew A; Bennett, Malcolm; Aldrich, Stephen; Harrington, Todd; Formenty, Pierre; Loh, Elizabeth H; Machalaba, Catherine C; Thomas, Mathew Jason; Heymann, David L","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de03b56ee99cfe2771a7a729f5ee5aea1aea7228.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138068.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S014067361261678X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361261678X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23200502/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(12)61678-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zoonotic disease prevention","Zoonotic disease organisms","zoonotic diseases","human populations","disease threats","human infectious diseases","animal populations","human beings","dynamics of disease exposure","substantial burden of disease","animal production","enzootic zoonoses","people","broad view of medicine","probability of future zoonotic emergence","evolutionary principles of animal","strategic prevention","global health","health outcomes","view of present anthropogenic trends","Emerging zoonoses","extraction of natural resources","natural pathogen ecology","targeted surveillance","effective approach","frequent cross-species transmission","practices","antimicrobial application","pathogens","US dollars of economic damage","control","hundreds of billions","engagement of partners","successful development of policies","medical community","growing threat","evidence-based decision","millions of deaths","cases of illness","circumstances","domestic animals","years","environmental factors"],"language":"en"},

It is necessary to detect ZIKV with a rapid and sensitive molecular method to guide timely treatment. In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was described, which is an attractive option as a fast, sensitive, and specific method for ZIKV detection using the NS5 protein coding region and the envelope protein (EP) coding region as target sequences. Two different techniques, a calcein/Mn(2\u002B) complex chromogenic method and real-time turbidity monitoring, were employed. The specificity and sensitivity of the LAMP assay were determined. The assay\u2019s detection limit was 0.5 \u00D7 10(\u22129) pmol/\u00B5l DNA for NS5 protein coding region and 1.12 \u00D7 10(\u221211) pmol/\u00B5l DNA for E coding region, respectively, which is a 100-fold increase in sensitivity compared with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and conventional PCR. All 12 non-ZIKA respiratory pathogens tested were negative for LAMP detection, indicating the high specificity of the primers for ZIKV. In conclusion, a visual detection LAMP assay was developed, which could be a useful tool for primary quarantine purposes and clinical screening, especially in situations where resources are poor and in point-of-care tests.","publish_time":"2018-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Jiangtao; Feng, Ruo","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f20529d499463013219363bae1b9af109ae672a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089109.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-018-1612-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30426316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","LAMP"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["ZIKV detection","LAMP detection","NS5 protein coding region","E coding region","visual detection LAMP assay","envelope protein","sensitive molecular method","\u00B5l DNA","specific method","sensitivity","pmol","assay\u2019s detection limit","complex chromogenic method","RT-PCR","high specificity","conventional PCR","Zika virus","real-time turbidity monitoring","non-ZIKA respiratory pathogens","real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","EP","clinical screening","primary quarantine purposes","Mn","useful tool","isothermal amplification","point","Africa","Asia","resources","situations","loop","timely treatment","target sequences","conclusion","fold increase","different techniques","calcein","humans","attractive option","mosquito","primers","care tests","flavivirus","America","study"],"language":"en"},

To asses the risk factor related to clinical material, climatic condition and type of RT-PCR applied, cloacal swabs (CS), faeces, sera, bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus (TH) and spleen (SP) and ileum-caeca region were collected from 30-day-old poults suffering of enteritis episode characterized as poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS). The PEMS clinical features were characterized by watery to foamy faeces, light brown-yellow in colour and low mortality rate. Meteorological data (rainfall and relative humidity) observed during along the study presented monthly average temperature ranging from 39.3 and 31.2\u00BAC, precipitation in rainy season from 40 to 270.3 mm/month, and no rain during dry season. Simplex RT-PCR gave odds ratio (OR) values suggesting that ileum-caeca region is at higher chance (OR=1.9; p=0.9741) to have both viral RNA than faeces (OR=1.5; p=0.7319). However, multiplex RT-PCR showed 3.98 (p=0.89982) more chance to give positive results in faeces than CS at dry season. The major risk factors seem to be low rate of humidity and high temperatures at winter, probably responsible for spread, easily, the TCoV and TAstv-2 among the flocks. The positive results of both virus suggested that they can play an important role in enteric disorders, associated to low humidity and high temperatures frequently found in tropical countries.","publish_time":"2009-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Silva, S.E.L.; Bonetti, A.M.; Petrocelli, A.; Ferrari, H.F.; Luvizotto, M.C.R.; Cardoso, T.C.","journal":"Braz J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/377786fe05588ea782213fcb92f39a6522f113bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3769739.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1590/s1517-83822009000200008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24031353/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Turkey Coronavirus","PEMS","CS"],"locations":["Brazil","South Eastern"],"keyphrases":["low humidity","low rate of humidity","foamy faeces","dry season","low mortality rate","Simplex RT-PCR","ileum-caeca region","multiplex RT-PCR","high temperatures","CS","relative humidity","type of RT","semiarid region of Brazil","positive results","TCoV","rainy season","TAstV","PEMS clinical features","enteritis episode","poult enteritis mortality syndrome","clinical material","higher chance","turkey producer area","South Eastern of Brazil","survey of Turkey Coronavirus","major risk factors","light brown-yellow","climatic condition","colour","BF","sera","Astrovirus","enteric disorders","odds ratio","values","cloacal swabs","bursa of Fabricius","thymus","spleen","\u00BAC","study","Meteorological data","rainfall","winter","day-old poults","monthly average temperature","important role","precipitation","asses","tropical countries","year","prevalence","viral RNA","flocks"],"language":"en"}]}

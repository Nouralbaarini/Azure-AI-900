The benefit of this community-based intervention in limiting COVID-19 has not been proven nor quantified. We examined the effect of timing of mandated social distancing on the rate of COVID-19 in 119 geographic regions derived from 41 states within United States and 78 countries. We found that highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day per million persons was significantly associated with total number of COVID-19 cases per million persons on the day before mandated social distancing (Beta;=0.66, p\u003C0.0001). Our findings suggest that the initiation of mandated social distancing for each doubling in number of existing COVID-19 cases would result in eventual peak with 58% higher number of COVID-19 infections per day. Subgroup analysis on those regions where the highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day have peaked increased Beta to .85 (p\u003C0.0001). We demonstrate that initiating mandated social distancing at a 10 times smaller number of COVID-19 cases will reduce the number of daily new COVID-19 cases at peak by 80% highlighting the importance of this community-based intervention.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suri, M.

Methods: Our study (NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. Findings: This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoints, the average time of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and conversion rates at days 7 and 14, were similar between groups (all P\u003E0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P\u003E0.05). At day 7, eight (23.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group and 2(11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe/critical(P =0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced adverse events during the follow-up period. No apparent adverse event occurred in the control group.

The current study describes the situation of the outbreak of this disease in India and predicts the number of cases expected to rise in India. The study also discusses the regional analysis of Indian states and presents the preparedness level of India in combating this outbreak. The study uses exploratory data analysis to report the current situation and uses time-series forecasting methods to predict the future trends. The data has been considered from the repository of John Hopkins University and covers up the time period from 30th January 2020 when the first case occurred in India till the end of 24th March 2020 when the Prime Minister of India declared a complete lockdown in the country for 21 days starting 25th March 2020. The major findings show that number of infected cases in India is rising quickly with the average infected cases per day rising from 10 to 73 from the first case to the 300th case. The current mortality rate for India stands around 1.9. Kerala and Maharashtra are the top two infected states in India with more than 100 infected cases reported in each state, respectively. A total of 25 states have reported at least one infected case, however only 8 of them have reported deaths due to COVID-19. The ARIMA model prediction shows that the infected cases in India may reach up to 700 thousands in next 30 days in worst case scenario while most optimistic scenario may restrict the numbers up to 1000-1200. Also, the average forecast by ARIMA model in next 30 days is around 7000 patients from the current numbers of 536. Based on the forecasting model by Holts linear trends, an expected 3 million people may get infected if control measures are not taken in the near future. This study will be useful for the key stakeholders like Government Officials and Medical Practitioners in assessing the trends for India and preparing a combat plan with stringent measures. Also, this study will be helpful for data scientists, statisticians, mathematicians and analytics professionals in predicting outbreak numbers with better accuracy.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Rajan; Pal, Saibal Kumar","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a32a8492764e86a0aa9a177d4debc871a32ed550.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044511","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["John Hopkins University","ARIMA","Medical Practitioners"],"locations":["India","Kerala","Maharashtra"],"keyphrases":["infected states","number of infected cases","average infected cases","current study","preparedness level of India","Prime Minister of India","number of cases","current numbers","current situation","days","worst case scenario","future trends","forecasting model","predicting outbreak numbers","data scientists","exploratory data analysis","ARIMA model prediction","current mortality rate","COVID","regional analysis of Indian states","Holts linear trends","optimistic scenario","time-series","stringent measures","control measures","average forecast","time period","near future","analytics professionals","mathematicians","key stakeholders","statisticians","Medical Practitioners","Government Officials","complete lockdown","people","better accuracy","combat plan","repository of John Hopkins University","methods","disease","major findings","country","Maharashtra","thousands","patients","Kerala","deaths","total","world"],"language":"en"},

The overall estimated PoS for an industry-sponsored vaccine program is 39.6%, and 16.3% for an industry-sponsored anti-infective therapeutic. Among industry-sponsored vaccines programs, only 12 out of 27 disease categories have seen at least one approval, with the most successful being against monkeypox (100%), rotavirus (78.7%), and Japanese encephalitis (67.6%). The three infectious diseases with the highest PoS for industry-sponsored non-vaccine therapeutics are smallpox (100%), CMV (31.8%), and onychomycosis (29.8%). Non-industry-sponsored vaccine and non-vaccine development programs have lower overall PoSs: 6.8% and 8.2%, respectively.

This membrane association of lactose permease was Na2CO3 resistant, detergent sensitive, and yielded a distinct pattern of proteolytic cleavage peptides. Moreover, membrane vesicles when present cotranslationally during synthesis of lactose permease, acquired the capability to accumulate lactose, strongly suggesting a correct in vitro assembly of the enzyme.

In this study, all BALB/cJ mice that were infected with 10(3) plaque-forming units of MHV-3 developed severe liver disease and died within 96-120 h. Examination of the livers of these animals showed marked hepatic necrosis, deposition of fibrin, and cellular expression of PCA by direct immunofluorescence staining in areas of necrosis as well as in hepatic sinusoids. Splenic mononuclear cells recovered from these mice expressed high concentrations of PCA with time after infection. Infusion into mice of a high-titered monoclonal antibody that neutralized PCA (3D4.3) attenuated the development of hepatic necrosis and enhanced survival in a dose- dependent manner. All of the animals receiving 100 micrograms, and 44% and 22% of the animals that received 50 and 25 micrograms per day, respectively, survived for 10 d and made a full recovery. Administration of the antibody resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in fibrin deposition, PCA expression as detected by direct immunofluorescence staining and by a functional assay. In animals treated with high concentrations of antibody, titers of antibody to PCA fell from 87 \u002B/- 15 micrograms/ml to 100 \u002B/- 7 ng/ml during the active phase of the disease, consistent with sequestration due to binding of the immunoglobulin to cells expressing PCA. Surviving animals, when rechallenged with MHV-3, had a 40% mortality, consistent with the known rates of metabolism of immunoglobulin. This further suggested that protection was by a passive mechanism. The results reported here demonstrate that a neutralizing antibody to PCA protects animals from fulminant hepatitis and death associated with MHV-3 infection, and supports the notion that PCA is a potent inflammatory mediator that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of liver injury resulting from MHV-3 infection.","publish_time":"1992-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9363422a0f9b40cd6bb8f6c7fbbcaadf146f20a6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2119354/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCA expression","induction of PCA","high concentrations of PCA","infection","cellular expression of PCA","units of MHV","Surviving animals","high concentrations of antibody","titers of antibody","neutralizing antibody","micrograms","high-titered monoclonal antibody","marked hepatic necrosis","development of hepatic necrosis","deposition of fibrin","fibrin deposition","direct immunofluorescence staining","areas of necrosis","cJ mice","immunoglobulin","hepatic sinusoids","developed severe liver disease","dose-dependent reduction","dose- dependent manner","pathogenesis of liver injury","fulminant hepatitis","pathogenesis of murine hepatitis virus","induction of monocyte","Splenic mononuclear cells","enhanced survival","pivotal role","potent inflammatory mediator","susceptibility","macrophage procoagulant activity","death","known rates of metabolism","different mouse strains","active phase","binding","sequestration","livers","resistance","notion","3D4","time","functional assay","mortality","study","BALB","protection","passive mechanism","Examination","plaque","Infusion","recovery","results","day","Administration"],"language":"en"},

By pulse-chase analysis of radiolabeled protein condensation in beta-cells, the formation of insoluble aggregates of regulated secretory protein lags behind the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. Condensation occurs within immature granules (IGs), accounting for passive protein sorting as demonstrated by constitutive-like secretion of newly synthesized C- peptide in stoichiometric excess of insulin (Kuliawat, R., and P. Arvan. J. Cell Biol. 1992. 118:521-529). Experimental manipulation of condensation conditions in vivo reveals a direct relationship between sorting of regulated secretory protein and polymer assembly within IGs. By contrast, entry from the trans-Golgi network into IGs does not appear especially selective for regulated secretory proteins. Specifically, in normal islets, lysosomal enzyme precursors enter the stimulus-dependent secretory pathway with comparable efficiency to that of proinsulin. However, within 2 h after synthesis (the same period during which proinsulin processing occurs), newly synthesized hydrolases are fairly efficiently relocated out of the stimulus- dependent pathway. In tunicamycin-treated islets, while entry of new lysosomal enzymes into the regulated secretory pathway continues unperturbed, exit of nonglycosylated hydrolases from this pathway does not occur. Consequently, the ultimate targeting of nonglycosylated hydrolases in beta-cells is to storage granules rather than lysosomes. These results implicate a post-Golgi mechanism for the active removal of lysosomal hydrolases away from condensed granule contents during the storage process for regulated secretory proteins.","publish_time":"1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17c30925f6e62319c5049126e8fddbc1410e9983.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2120086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P.

Recently, we have identified a distinct category of mutation, caused by premature stop codons and frameshift mutations, which manifests in diminished expression of COOH-terminally truncated CFTR at the cell surface. Although the biosynthetic processing and plasma membrane targeting of truncated CFTRs are preserved, the turnover of the complex-glycosylated mutant is sixfold faster than its wild-type (wt) counterpart. Destabilization of the truncated CFTR coincides with its enhanced susceptibility to proteasome-dependent degradation from post-Golgi compartments globally, and the plasma membrane specifically, determined by pulse\u2013chase analysis in conjunction with cell surface biotinylation. Proteolytic cleavage of the full-length complex-glycosylated wt and degradation intermediates derived from both T70 and wt CFTR requires endolysosomal proteases. The enhanced protease sensitivity in vitro and the decreased thermostability of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR in vivo suggest that structural destabilization may account for the increased proteasome susceptibility and the short residence time at the cell surface. These in turn are responsible, at least in part, for the phenotypic manifestation of CF. We propose that the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway may be involved in the peripheral quality control of other, partially unfolded membrane proteins as well.","publish_time":"2001-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benharouga, Mohamed; Haardt, Martin; Kartner, Norbert; Lukacs, Gergely L.","journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8931fabdc25094445ab2450c3a5117dab632e868.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2174331.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2174331/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFTR","CF."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wt CFTR","complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR","full-length complex-glycosylated wt","plasma membrane","complex-glycosylated mutant","cell surface biotinylation","proteasome-dependent degradation","increased proteasome susceptibility","enhanced susceptibility","truncated CFTRs","Impaired biosynthetic processing","proteasome-ubiquitin pathway","unfolded membrane proteins","degradation intermediates","structural destabilization","enhanced protease sensitivity","cystic fibrosis","short residence time","transmembrane conductance regulator","conjunction","decreased thermostability","post-Golgi compartments","frameshift mutations","wild-type","chase analysis","premature stop codons","pulse","turnover","diminished expression of COOH","cAMP-regulated chloride channel","endolysosomal proteases","Proteolytic cleavage","distinct category of mutation","peripheral quality control","counterpart","common cause of","phenotypic manifestation of"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, mislocalization of PEX19 to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. At steady state, PEX19 is bimodally distributed between the cytoplasm and peroxisome, with most of the protein in the cytoplasm. We propose that PEX19 may bind newly synthesized PMPs and facilitate their insertion into the peroxisome membrane.

The observation that these lipoprotein particles are heavily disulphide crosslinked is paradoxical since HBsAg assembly is classically believed to occur in the ER, and hence in the presence of high levels of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) which should resolve these higher intermolecular crosslinks. Indeed, incubation of mature, highly disulphide crosslinked HBsAg with recombinant PDI causes the disassembly of HBsAg to dimers. We have used antibodies against resident ER proteins in double immunofluorescence studies to study the stages of the conversion of the HBsAg from individual protein subunits to the secreted, crosslinked, oligomer. We show that HBsAg is rapidly sorted to a post-ER, pre-Golgi compartment which excludes PDI and other major soluble resident ER proteins although it overlaps with the distribution of rab2, an established marker of an intermediate compartment. Kinetic studies showed that disulphide-linked HBsAg dimers began to form during a short (2 min) pulse, increased in concentration to peak at 60 min, and then decreased as the dimers were crosslinked to form higher oligomers. These higher oligomers are the latest identifiable intracellular form of HBsAg before its secretion (t 1/2 = 2 h). Brefeldin A treatment does not alter the localization of HBsAg in this PDI excluding compartment, however, it blocks the formation of new oligomers causing the accumulation of dimeric HBsAg. Hence this oligomerization must occur in a pre-Golgi compartment. These data support a model in which rapid dimer formation, catalyzed by PDI, occurs in the ER, and is followed by transport of dimers to a pre-Golgi compartment where the absence of PDI and a different lumenal environment allow the assembly process to be completed.","publish_time":"1992-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b635859a59cb70b756b0768ec74405e226b5568.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2289601/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBsAg assembly","disulphide crosslinked HBsAg","disassembly of HBsAg","localization of HBsAg","disulphide-linked HBsAg dimers","absence of PDI","accumulation of dimeric HBsAg","pre-Golgi compartment","recombinant PDI","higher oligomers","latest identifiable intracellular form of HBsAg","post-ER","intermediate compartment","major soluble resident ER proteins","transport of dimers","form of disk","formation of new oligomers","major envelope protein","viral proteins","secretion","presence of high levels of protein disulphide isomerase","individual protein subunits","tubular lipoprotein particles","higher intermolecular crosslinks","Kinetic studies","assembly process","double immunofluorescence studies","rapid dimer formation","different lumenal environment","established marker","Expression of hepatitis B surface antigen","stages","model","virus","conversion","antibodies","distribution of rab2","incubation of mature","pulse","treatment","data","observation","oligomerization","concentration","Brefeldin"],"language":"en"},

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests are optimal and recommended for the diagnosis of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serology tests for viral antibodies provide an important tool to diagnose previous exposure to the virus. Here we evaluate the analytical performance parameters of the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG serology assays and describe the kinetics of IgM and IgG seroconversion observed in patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital. METHODS We validated the performance of the Diazyme assay in 235 subjects to determine specificity. Subsequently, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG seroconversion of 54 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and determined sensitivity of the assay at three different timeframes. RESULT Sensitivity and specificity for detecting seropositivity at \u2265 15 days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, was 100.0% and 98.7% when assaying for the panel of IgM and IgG.

The highly contagious nature of this virus makes it imperative for us to identify promising inhibitors from pre-existing antiviral drugs. Two druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase) were selected in this study due to their indispensable nature in the viral life cycle. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease responsible for the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins resulting in the formation of various functional proteins, whereas 2\u2032-O-MTase methylates the ribose 2\u2032-O position of the first and second nucleotide of viral mRNA, which sequesters it from the host immune system. The selected drug target proteins were screened against an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs. Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (\u0394G), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were then subjected to MD simulation, which consists of various structural parameters to equivalently reflect their physiological state. From the virtual screening results, two drug molecules were selected for each drug target protein [Paritaprevir (\u0394G = \u22129.8 kcal/mol) \u0026 Raltegravir (\u0394G = \u22127.8 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro and Dolutegravir (\u0394G = \u22129.4 kcal/mol) and Bictegravir (\u0394G = \u22128.4 kcal/mol) for 2\u2032-OMTase]. After the extensive computational analysis, we proposed that Raltegravir, Paritaprevir, Bictegravir and Dolutegravir are excellent lead candidates for these crucial proteins and they could become potential therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, there is a demand for analytical techniques enabling rapid and reliable glycoprofiling of therapeutic proteins. For the investigation of changes in glycan structures, we have employed two platforms: lectin-based protein microarray, and MALDI-MS. In lectin-based microarray analysis, the samples of IgA were printed on the microarray slide, incubated with the set of lectins with various specificity and evaluation of changes in glycosylation was based on differences in reactivity of samples with lectins. MALDI-MS was used for N-glycan analysis of IgA1 samples. IgAs are effective as therapeutic agents in defense against viruses that use sialic acid as a receptor. Dimeric IgA1 antibodies were produced by stable cell line IgA1/2G9 on the basal medium at different conditions (different supplementation and feeding) and we also evaluated the effect of different conditions on lactate production, which correlates with IgA productivity. Decrease of lactate levels was observed during supplementation with succinic acid, asparagine, or with mannose feeding. We found by lectin-based microarray analysis that the metabolic shift from glutamine to asparagine or feeding with glucose caused increase of high mannose type glycans what was confirmed also by MALDI-MS. Among other changes in IgA glycosylation determined by lectin-based protein microarray were, for example, reduced galactosylation after supplementation with succinic acid and increase of both sialylation and galactosylation after supplementation with glutamine and feeding with mannose.

Despite widespread interest in the pathophysiology of the disease, relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the peripheral lung of patients who die from Covid-19. METHODS We examined 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from Covid-19 and compared them with 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A(H1N1) infection and 10 age-matched, uninfected control lungs. The lungs were studied with the use of seven-color immunohistochemical analysis, micro-computed tomographic imaging, scanning electron microscopy, corrosion casting, and direct multiplexed measurement of gene expression. RESULTS In patients who died from Covid-19-associated or influenza-associated respiratory failure, the histologic pattern in the peripheral lung was diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration. The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes. Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy. Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P\u003C0.001). In lungs from patients with Covid-19, the amount of new vessel growth - predominantly through a mechanism of intussusceptive angiogenesis - was 2.7 times as high as that in the lungs from patients with influenza (P\u003C0.001). CONCLUSIONS In our small series, vascular angiogenesis distinguished the pulmonary pathobiology of Covid-19 from that of equally severe influenza virus infection.

Respiratory viruses were detected in 660 samples (47%). HBoV detection rate was 12.6%, only preceded by respiratory syncytial virus (25%). Co-detections were observed in 12.9% of samples, and HBoV was present in 81% of them. Similar detection rates of HBoV were obtained in individuals with positive and negative results for other respiratory viruses (12.5% and 12.7%, respectively). The crossing point value was taken as a measure of HBoV viral load. Higher HBoV loads were observed in children, and in patients from the hospital. HBoV viral load was not associated with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection or lower respiratory tract disease. Although HBoV is frequently detected in respiratory specimens, there is a poor association between HBoV-positive specimens and clinical parameters. A clinical impact of HBoV in respiratory infection probably occurs in few cases.","publish_time":"2011-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedrosa-Corral, Irene; P\u00E9rez-Ruiz, Mercedes; Navarro-Mar\u00ED, Jos\u00E9-Mar\u00EDa; Ruiz-Bravo, Alfonso","journal":"Indian Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cbc6cb6ce91799242532d6411d05e1beb5d2563.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3550741.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3550741?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13337-011-0042-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23637508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","respiratory specimens","HBoV detection rate","HBoV-positive specimens","clinical impact of HBoV","acute respiratory infections","respiratory syncytial virus","Higher HBoV loads","measure of HBoV viral load","Similar detection rates of HBoV","lower respiratory tract disease","symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection","frequent detection","viral culture","direct antigen detection","outpatients","sputum samples","human infectious disease","role of Human bocavirus","poor association","clinical parameters","reference hospital","recognized pathogenic role","emergency attention","hospitalisation","real-time PCR","nasal","individuals","negative results","throat swabs","BAL","shell-vial assay","children","crossing point value","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","cases","Co-detections"],"language":"en"},

However, in the last several decades, a new set of technologies has become available, based on the methods of computer sciences, systems biology, and the extraordinary powers of the Internet. Technological and analytical advances can enhance traditional epidemiological methods to study the emergence, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics of viruses and associated diseases. Social media are increasingly used to detect the emergence and geographic spread of viral disease outbreaks. Large-scale population movement can be estimated using satellite imagery and mobile phone use, and fine-scale population movement can be tracked using global positioning system loggers, allowing estimation of transmission pathways and contact patterns at different spatial scales. Advances in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics permit more accurate determination of viral evolution and the construction of transmission networks, also at different spatial and temporal scales. Phylodynamics links evolutionary and epidemiological processes to better understand viral transmission patterns. More complex and realistic mathematical models of virus transmission within human and animal populations, including detailed agent-based models, are increasingly used to predict transmission patterns and the impact of control interventions such as vaccination and quarantine. In this chapter, we will briefly review traditional epidemiological methods and then describe the new technologies with some examples of their application.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rainwater-Lovett, Kaitlin; Rodriguez-Barraquer, Isabel; Moss, William J.","journal":"Viral Pathogenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/055dd8279f848e0c60d33f73804725a0d682ec61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149612.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128009642000185; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009642000185","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral transmission patterns","traditional methods","traditional epidemiological methods","estimation of transmission pathways","transmission dynamics of viruses","construction of transmission networks","realistic mathematical models of virus transmission","contact patterns","epidemiological processes","emergence","different spatial scales","methods of computer sciences","new technologies","new set of technologies","Large-scale population movement","accurate determination of viral evolution","fine-scale population movement","analytical advances","distribution of diseases","detailed agent-based models","associated diseases","temporal scales","science of epidemiology","geographic spread of viral disease outbreaks","bioinformatics permit","human","animal populations","mobile phone use","systems biology","genomic sequencing","satellite imagery","global positioning system loggers","impact of control interventions","extraordinary powers","vaccination","person","place","Phylodynamics links evolutionary","quarantine","examples","decades","Internet","time","application","years","Social media","chapter"],"language":"en"},

TRIM13, a member of the TRIM family, is a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase which plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes including cell death, cancer and antiviral immunity. In this study, a TRIM13 homolog from orange spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (EcTRIM13) was cloned and characterized. The full-length of EcTRIM13 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 399 amino acids which shared 81% identity with TRIM13 homolog from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). Amino acid alignment analysis showed that EcTRIM13 contained conserved RING finger and B-box domain. Expression patterns analysis indicated that EcTRIM13 was abundant in liver, spleen, kidney, intestine and gill. Moreover, the transcript of EcTRIM13 in grouper spleen was differently regulated after injection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or polyinosin-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Under fluorescence microscopy, we observed the tubular structure in wild type EcTRIM13 transfected cells, but the RING domain mutant resulted in the fluorescence distribution was changed and the bright punctate fluorescence was evenly situated throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting that the RING domain was essential for its accurate localization. Overexpression of EcTRIM13 in vitro obviously increased the replication of red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), and the enhancing effect of EcTRIM13 on virus replication was affected by the RING domain. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM13 not only negatively regulated the interferon promoter activity induced by interferon regulator factor (IRF) 3, IRF7, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), but also decreased the expression of several interferon related factors. In addition, the overexpression of EcTRIM13 also differently regulated the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors. Together, our results firstly demonstrated that fish TRIM13 exerted negative regulation of antiviral response against nodavirus infection.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Youhua; Yang, Min; Yu, Yepin; Yang, Ying; Zhou, Linli; Huang, Xiaohong; Qin, Qiwei","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca930030395540cd911e24309cb83e7dff1a8f96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129363.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27235367/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464816303370; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464816303370; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.05.029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Singapore"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Overexpression of EcTRIM13","transcript of EcTRIM13","ectopic expression of EcTRIM13","enhancing effect of EcTRIM13","full-length of EcTRIM13 cDNA","RING domain mutant","grouper spleen","TRIM13 homolog","wild type EcTRIM13 transfected cells","fish TRIM13","orange spotted grouper","conserved RING finger","B-box domain","virus replication","Singapore grouper iridovirus","interferon related factors","fluorescence distribution","Expression patterns analysis","fluorescence microscopy","replication of red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus","Amino acid alignment analysis","interferon regulator factor","interferon promoter activity","bright punctate fluorescence","antiviral immunity","TRIM family","amino acids","diverse cellular processes","different biological processes","polyinosin-polycytidylic acid","negative regulation of antiviral response","transcription of pro-inflammatory factors","critical roles","cell death","SGIV","tubular structure","RGNNV","large yellow croaker","E3 ubiquitin ligase","multiple functions","cancer","identity","injection","Epinephelus coioides","IRF7","kidney","polypeptide","liver","melanoma differentiation-associated protein","particular attention","Larimichthys crocea","nodavirus infection","proteins","accurate localization","MDA5","gill","member","study","cytoplasm","tripartite motif","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

The tool could support public health decision-makers in implementation of an effective control strategy in a timely manner. Methods We used monthly surveillance data between 2004 and 2015 to predict case counts between 2016 and 2017 prospectively. The Turkish nationwide surveillance data set collected by the Ministry of Health contained 10 411 confirmed CCHF cases. We collected potential explanatory covariates about climate, land use, and animal and human populations at risk to capture spatiotemporal transmission dynamics. We developed a structured Gaussian process algorithm and prospectively tested this tool predicting the future year\u0027s cases given past years\u0027 cases. Results We predicted the annual cases in 2016 and 2017 as 438 and 341, whereas the observed cases were 432 and 343, respectively. Pearson\u0027s correlation coefficient and normalized root mean squared error values for 2016 and 2017 predictions were (0.83; 0.58) and (0.87; 0.52), respectively. The most important covariates were found to be the number of settlements with fewer than 25 000 inhabitants, latitude, longitude and potential evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration). Conclusions Main driving factors of CCHF dynamics were human population at risk in rural areas, geographical dependency and climate effect on ticks. Our model was able to prospectively predict the numbers of CCHF cases. Our proof-of-concept study also provided insight for understanding possible mechanisms of infectious diseases and found important directions for practice and policy to combat against emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ak, \u00C7.; Erg\u00F6n\u00FCl, \u00D6.; G\u00F6nen, M.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cb8afcb4fe6d5261f741ea877818fe3c2b69b84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129556.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2019.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129282/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X19302216; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X19302216","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["CCHF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["confirmed CCHF cases","numbers of CCHF cases","annual cases","observed cases","risk","future year\u0027s cases","past years\u0027 cases","important covariates","Conclusions Main driving factors of CCHF dynamics","prospective prediction tool","emerging infectious diseases","potential explanatory covariates","monthly surveillance data","human populations","climate effect","Ministry of Health","potential evapotranspiration","possible mechanisms of infectious diseases","important directions","Turkish nationwide surveillance data set","spatiotemporal transmission dynamics","public health decision-makers","rural areas","normalized root","implementation","geographical dependency","Crimean","land use","Congo haemorrhagic fever","policy","animal","effective control strategy","squared error values","Pearson\u0027s correlation coefficient","inhabitants","insight","latitude","longitude","practice","fewer","timely manner","evaporation","ticks","concept study","structured Gaussian process algorithm","geographic regions","number of settlements","Methods","proof","predictions","Abstract Objectives","model"],"language":"en"},

Gene expression analysis demonstrated that CYP88D6 was over-expressed only in one of transgenic hairy root lines and was reduced in two others. Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase (CYP93E6) was significantly expressed in one of the control hairy root lines. The amount of glycyrrhizin metabolite in over-expressed line was more than or similar to that of control hairy root lines.

METHODS: Sleep physiology, somatic and mood symptoms of 22 Toronto subjects, 21 of whom were healthcare workers, (19 females, 3 males, mean age 46.29 yrs.\u002B/- 11.02) who remained unable to return to their former occupation (mean 19.8 months, range: 13 to 36 months following SARS) were compared to 7 healthy female subjects. Because of their clinical similarities to patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) these post-SARS subjects were similarly compared to 21 drug free female patients, (mean age 42.4 \u002B/- 11.8 yrs.) who fulfilled criteria for fibromyalgia. RESULTS: Chronic post-SARS is characterized by persistent fatigue, diffuse myalgia, weakness, depression, and nonrestorative sleep with associated REM-related apneas/hypopneas, an elevated sleep EEG cyclical alternating pattern, and alpha EEG sleep anomaly. Post- SARS patients had symptoms of pre and post-sleep fatigue and post sleep sleepiness that were similar to the symptoms of patients with FMS, and similar to symptoms of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Both post-SARS and FMS groups had sleep instability as indicated by the high sleep EEG cyclical alternating pattern rate. The post-SARS group had a lower rating of the alpha EEG sleep anomaly as compared to the FMS patients. The post-SARS group also reported less pre-sleep and post-sleep musculoskeletal pain symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and sleep features of chronic post-SARS form a syndrome of chronic fatigue, pain, weakness, depression and sleep disturbance, which overlaps with the clinical and sleep features of FMS and chronic fatigue syndrome.","publish_time":"2011-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moldofsky, Harvey; Patcai, John","journal":"BMC Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da263831b51c583027932f156c45463780ea35fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3071317.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2377-11-37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21435231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["post-sleep fatigue","Post- SARS patients","sleep features of chronic post-SARS","pre-sleep","nonrestorative sleep","sleep instability","Sleep physiology","sleep disturbance","sleep features of FMS","post-SARS group","post-sleep musculoskeletal pain symptoms","SARS subjects","alpha EEG sleep anomaly","symptoms of patients","FMS patients","post sleep sleepiness","syndrome of chronic fatigue","chronic fatigue syndrome","elevated sleep EEG cyclical alternating pattern","high sleep EEG cyclical alternating pattern rate","fibromyalgia syndrome","symptoms of pre","persistent fatigue","mood symptoms","FMS groups","drug free female patients","mean age","weakness","depression","clinical similarities","Toronto subjects","healthy female subjects","months","long term adverse effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","hypopneas","lower rating","associated REM-related apneas","females","diffuse myalgia","BACKGROUND","occupation","range","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","healthcare workers","viral disease","criteria"],"language":"en"},

We found that the distribution of Wuhan\u2019s migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan\u2019s migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan\u2019s total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan\u2019s migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3\u20134 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhan\u2019s migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has increased rapidly. The results are conducive to monitoring the epidemic prevention and control in various regions.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Changyu; Liu, Linping; Guo, Wei; Yang, Anuo; Ye, Chenchen; Jilili, Maitixirepu; Ren, Meina; Xu, Peng; Long, Hexing; Wang, Yufan","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7084718.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32143519/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17051679","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hubei Province","distribution of Wuhan\u2019s migrants","scale of Wuhan\u2019s migrants","Wuhan\u2019s total migrants","size of Wuhan\u2019s migrants","surrounding provinces","China Migrants Dynamic Survey","epidemic situation","epidemic prevention","various regions","different regions","districts","counties","surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan","daily number of confirmed cases","nuclear family migration","social characteristics","provincial level","obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers","rise","origins","large proportion of middle-aged","gradient reduction","west","east","high-risk individuals","echelons","CMDS","control","account","cumulative percentage","hometown communities","quasi-experimental analysis framework","nCoV","outbreak","end","novel coronavirus","rural household registration","data","families","main reason","results","members","business"],"language":"en"},

There are also several groups of organisms which accumulate vanadium, employing it in their biological processes. Vanadium being a biological relevant element, it is not surprising that many vanadium based therapeutic drugs have been proposed for the treatment of several types of diseases. Namely, vanadium compounds, in particular organic derivatives, have been proposed for the treatment of diabetes, of cancer and of diseases caused by parasites. In this work we review the medicinal applications proposed for vanadium compounds with particular emphasis on the more recent publications. In cells, partly due to the similarity of vanadate and phosphate, vanadium compounds activate numerous signaling pathways and transcription factors; this by itself potentiates application of vanadium-based therapeutics. Nevertheless, this non-specific bio-activity may also introduce several deleterious side effects as in addition, due to Fenton\u0027s type reactions or of the reaction with atmospheric O2, VCs may also generate reactive oxygen species, thereby introducing oxidative stress with consequences presently not well evaluated, particularly for long-term administration of vanadium to humans. Notwithstanding, the potential of vanadium compounds to treat type 2 diabetes is still an open question and therapies using vanadium compounds for e.g. antitumor and anti-parasitic related diseases remain promising.","publish_time":"2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pessoa, Joao Costa; Etcheverry, Susana; Gambino, Dinorah","journal":"Coordination Chemistry Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa9c59efecfdc51c984b800d4c8a63d0f2b13359.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094629.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226091/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2014.12.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001085451400335X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001085451400335X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["application of vanadium","Abstract Vanadium","potential of vanadium compounds","long-term administration of vanadium","biological relevant element","biological systems","treatment of diabetes","types of diseases","biological processes","particular emphasis","anti-parasitic related diseases","essential element","based therapeutics","Fenton\u0027s type reactions","particular organic derivatives","VCs","open question","water","reactive oxygen species","addition","air","pathways","phosphate","therapies","oxidative stress","medicinal applications","crude oil","atmospheric O2","transcription factors","roles","cancer","similarity of vanadate","therapeutic drugs","soil","living beings","recent publications","transition metal","humans","non-specific bio-activity","effects","consequences","work","parasites","groups of organisms","cells"],"language":"en"},

Reoviruses contain ten double-stranded RNA gene segments enclosed in two concentric protein shells, outer capsid and core. These viruses serve as a versatile experimental system for studies of virus cell entry, innate immunity, and organ-specific disease. Reoviruses engage cells by binding to cell-surface carbohydrates and the immunoglobulin superfamily member, junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A). JAM-A is a homodimer formed by extensive contacts between its N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains. Reo-virus attachment protein \u03C31 disrupts the JAM-A dimer, engaging a single JAM-A molecule by virtually the same interface used for JAM-A homodimerization. Following attachment to JAM-A and carbohydrate, reovirus internalization is promoted by \u03B21 integrins, most likely via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. In the endocytic compartment, reovirus outer-capsid protein \u03C33 is removed by cathepsin proteases, which exposes the viral membrane-penetration protein, \u03BC1. Proteolytic processing and conformational rearrangements of \u03BC1 mediate endosomal membrane rupture and delivery of transcriptionally active reovirus core particles into the host cell cytoplasm. These events also allow the \u03D5 cleavage fragment of \u03BC1 to escape into the cytoplasm where it activates NF-\u03BAB and elicits apoptosis. This review will focus on mechanisms of reovirus cell entry and activation of innate immune response signaling pathways.","publish_time":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Danthi, Pranav; Guglielmi, Kristen M.; Kirchner, Eva; Mainou, Bernardo; Stehle, Thilo; Dermody, Terence S.","journal":"Cell Entry by Non-Enveloped Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88e26fb7e73675aa4dc22c6d19dcd61a36d569a1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ffc93dea5a5f4e6e65ad155e87aafa98aa8c54cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4714703.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4714703?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2010_32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20397070/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single JAM","mechanisms of reovirus cell entry","reovirus outer-capsid protein \u03C33","reovirus internalization","host cell cytoplasm","studies of virus cell entry","cell-surface carbohydrates","active reovirus core particles","concentric protein shells","outer capsid","viral membrane-penetration protein","Reo-virus attachment protein \u03C31","conformational rearrangements of \u03BC1","innate immunity","\u03D5 cleavage fragment of \u03BC1","immunoglobulin superfamily member","endosomal membrane rupture","N-terminal immunoglobulin","junctional adhesion molecule","activation of innate immune response","Reoviridae family of nonenveloped viruses","delivery","versatile experimental system","double-stranded RNA gene segments","members","\u03B21 integrins","cathepsin proteases","binding","extensive contacts","endocytic compartment","organ-specific disease","pathways","Proteolytic processing","cells","clathrin-dependent endocytosis","events","NF-\u03BAB","domains","interface","Mammalian orthoreoviruses","apoptosis","review","homodimerization"],"language":"en"},

Introduction In 2005 a new respiratory virus, called human bocavirus (HBoV), was cloned from respiratory samples from Swedish infants and children with lower respiratory tract infections. Objectives To determine whether HBoV has circulated in Spain, estimate the frequency of HBoV infections in patients hospitalized for respiratory infection and describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients. Patients and methods We performed a descriptive prospective study of confirmed HBoV infections in patients aged \u003C 14 years old, hospitalized for respiratory infections between October 2004 and June 2005. Virologic diagnosis was based on multiple RT-PCR for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, influenza A,B, and C, parainfluenza 1-4, adenovirus and rhinovirus; PCR was used for human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirates was used for HBoV. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients were analyzed. Results Fifty-two cases of HBoV infection were detected, representing 17.1 % (95 % CI: 13 % a 21 %) of patients hospitalized for respiratory infections. HBoV was the third most frequent viral agent after RSV (30 %) and rhinovirus (25 %). In 39 patients (71.1 %) coinfection with another respiratory virus was detected. Fifty percent of the patients were aged less than 13.6 months and 75 % were aged less than 2 years. The most frequent diagnoses were recurrent wheezing (55.8 %), bronchiolitis (21.2 %) and pneumonia (15.4 %). Clinical sepsis with petechial exanthema was found in two patients. Fever \u003E 38 \u00B0C was found in 72.1 % and radiological infiltrate in 44 %. Hypoxia was present in 55.8 % of the patients. HBoV was isolated in distinct episodes in two patients. Coinfections were similar to simple infections except that hypoxia was more frequent in the former (p 0.038). Conclusions HBoV is one of the most frequent viruses in severe respiratory infections in patients aged less than 14 years old. Only RSV and rhinovirus are more frequent. Coinfections are highly frequent. Most patients are infants with recurrent wheezing and bronchiolitis.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, M.

Several over the counter products are available which provide symptomatic, not causal relief. For such lozenges, containing the antiseptics and local anesthetics amylmetacresol (AMC) and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) or hexylresorcinol (HR), recently an additional virucidal effect was published. Therefore, we tested a set of Strepsils(\u00AE) lozenges, containing either HR (Max [#2]) or AMC/DCBA (Original [#3], Extra Strong [#4], Warm [#5], Orange and Vitamin C [#6], Sugar free Lemon [#7], Children/Strawberry [#8] and Soothing Honey and Lemon [#9]) for their antiviral efficiency against representatives of respiratory viruses known to cause sore throat: human rhinovirus (HRV) 1a, HRV8, influenza virus A H1N1n, Coxsackievirus A10, and human coronavirus (hCoV) OC43. The lozenges were tested head to head with Coldamaris(\u00AE) lozenges (#1), which contain the patented antiviral iota-carrageenan. None of the tested AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges shows any antiviral effectiveness against HRV8 at the tested concentrations, whereas all are moderately active against HRV1a. Only lozenge #5 shows any activity against hCoV OC43 and Coxsackievirus A10 at the tested concentrations. Similarly, only lozenge #3 is moderately active against influenza A H1N1n virus. The data indicates that neither the isolated effect of the active ingredients nor the pH but rather one or more of the excipients of the specific formulations are responsible for the antiviral effect of some of the AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges. In contrast, carrageenan-containing lozenges are highly active against all viruses tested. In another experiment, we showed that binding and inactivation of virus particles by iota-carrageenan are fast and highly effective. During the residence time of the lozenge in the mouth, the viral titer is reduced by 85% and 91% for influenza A virus and hCoV OC43, respectively. Carrageenan-containing lozenges are, therefore, suitable as causative therapy against viral infections of the throat.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morokutti-Kurz, Martina; Graf, Christine; Prieschl-Grassauer, Eva","journal":"Int J Gen Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5856a3f4b9fc9b0947bf045feb20d32d581221dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5339006.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28280379/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s120665","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Max"],"organizations":["AMC/DCBA","Soothing Honey","Coxsackievirus A10"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lozenges","tested AMC","DCBA","tested concentrations","influenza virus","H1N1n virus","hCoV OC43","patented antiviral iota-carrageenan","antiviral effectiveness","antiviral efficiency","active ingredients","Coxsackievirus A10","HRV8","inactivation of virus particles","isolated effect","head","representatives of respiratory viruses","additional virucidal effect","human coronavirus","human rhinovirus","viral infections","viral titer","sore throats","Sugar free Lemon","antiseptics","activity","causative therapy","specific formulations","local anesthetics amylmetacresol","binding","mouth","hexylresorcinol","dichlorobenzyl alcohol","Orange","counter products","excipients","Coldamaris","Vitamin C","causal relief","Soothing Honey","residence time","Strawberry","Children","data","pH","set of Strepsils","contrast","Max","experiment","HRV1a"],"language":"en"},

Most patients with COVID-19 present with constitutional and respiratory symptoms, some patients present with atypical symptoms including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or neurological symptoms. Here we present a series of four COVID-19 patients with acute stroke as a presenting symptom. METHODS: We searched the hospital databases for patients presenting with acute strokes and suspected COVID-19 features. All patients that had imaging confirmed strokes and PCR confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients admitted to the hospital with PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease whose hospital course was complicated with acute stroke while inpatient were excluded from the study. Retrospective patient data were obtained from electronic medical records. Informed consent was obtained. RESULTS: We identified four patients presenting with imaging confirmed acute strokes and PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We elucidate the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and the clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Timely assessment and hyperacute treatment is the key to minimize mortality and morbidity of patients with acute stroke. Stroke teams should be wary of the fact that COVID-19 patients can present with cerebrovascular accidents and dawn appropriate personal protective equipment in every suspected patient. Further studies are urgently needed for a comprehensive understanding of the neurological pathology of COVID-19 and its effects on the nervous system.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Avula, Akshay; Nalleballe, Krishna; Narula, Naureen; Sapozhnikov, Steven; Dandu, Vasuki; Toom, Sudhamshi; Glaser, Allison; Elsayegh, Dany","journal":"Brain Behav Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0249d8f90c919f975e6cfc588b78d59f5e19800.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187846.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159120306851; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.077; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120306851?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360439/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspected COVID","morbidity of patients","acute strokes","neurological pathology of COVID","PCR","Stroke teams","hospital course","neurological symptoms","suspected patient","imaging findings","atypical symptoms","hospital databases","respiratory symptoms","clinical course","presenting symptom","study","medical emergency","clinical characteristics","electronic medical records","Retrospective patient data","appropriate personal protective equipment","hyperacute treatment","cerebrovascular accidents","key","mortality","Timely assessment","SARS-CoV","CONCLUSIONS","comprehensive understanding","fact","disease","effects","features","inpatient","OBJECTIVE","nervous system","infection","METHODS","series","Informed consent","studies","pandemic","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

As long as it is still unknown, which microorganism represents a real risk for the recipient, experience from allotransplantation should be brought in. Due to the fact that pigs can be screened long before the date of transplantation, xenotransplantation will become eventually safer compared with allotransplantation. Screening and selection of animals free of potential zoonotic microorganisms, Caesarean section, vaccination and/or treatment with chemotherapeutics are the strategies of choice to obtain donor animals not transmitting microorganisms. In the case of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) which are integrated in the genome of all pigs and which cannot be eliminated this way, selection of animals with low virus expression and generation of genetically modified pigs suppressing PERV expressions may be performed.","publish_time":"2015-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Denner, Joachim; Mueller, Nicolas J.","journal":"Int J Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aead93dd8f7c2b42a9021e77fda95c2c36ec1251.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185644.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1743919115011358; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2015.08.032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919115011358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26316157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PERV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["donor animals","selection of animals free of potential zoonotic microorganisms","putative zoonotic microorganisms","Xenotransplantation","modified pigs","allotransplantation","worst case","human recipient","case of porcine endogenous retroviruses","broad screening program","transfer of porcine infectious agents","low virus expression","vaccination","Caesarean section","generation","bacteria","real risk","strategies of choice","organs","chemotherapeutics","treatment","pig cells","tissues","experience","specific detection methods","fungi","disease","zoonosis","way","date of transplantation","expressions","fact","genome"],"language":"en"},

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalization. Pathogen identification fails in approximately 20% of children but is critical for optimal treatment and prevention of hospital-acquired infections. We used two broad-spectrum detection strategies to identify pathogens in test-negative children with CAP and asymptomatic controls. METHODS. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs from 70 children \u003C5 years with CAP of unknown etiology and 90 asymptomatic controls were tested by next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) and pan viral group (PVG) PCR for 19 viral families. Association of viruses with CAP was assessed by adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals controlling for season and age group. RESULTS. RNA-seq/PVG PCR detected previously missed, putative pathogens in 34% of patients. Putative viral pathogens included human parainfluenza virus 4 (aOR 9.3, P = .12), human bocavirus (aOR 9.1, P \u003C .01), Coxsackieviruses (aOR 5.1, P = .09), rhinovirus A (aOR 3.5, P = .34), and rhinovirus C (aOR 2.9, P = .57). RNA-seq was more sensitive for RNA viruses whereas PVG PCR detected more DNA viruses. CONCLUSIONS. RNA-seq and PVG PCR identified additional viruses, some known to be pathogenic, in NP/OP specimens from one-third of children hospitalized with CAP without a previously identified etiology.

To allow the implementation of such biomarkers into the clinics, the performance of large-scale studies employing solid validation criteria becomes essential. Focusing on the etiological agents and after an extensive review of the field, we present a comprehensive revision of the main metabolic biomarkers of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases.

Eighteen had no diarrhoea, 22 had no significant clinical signs related to gastroenteritis.

In the last one decade, not less than ten novel swine-infecting viruses have been added to the subfamily, and ceaseless efforts have been in top gear to determine the occurrence and prevalence of the old and new swine parvoviruses in herds of pig-producing countries worldwide. The story, however, is on the contrary on the African continent as there is presently a dearth of information on surveillance initiatives of the viruses among swine herds of pig-producing countries in the region. Timely detection and characterization of the viral pathogens is highly imperative for the implementation of effective control and prevention of its spread. This review therefore presents a concise overview on the epidemiology of novel porcine parvoviruses globally and also provides up-to-date highlights on the reported cases of the viral agents in the African sub-region.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Afolabi, Kayode Olayinka; Iweriebor, Benson Chuks; Okoh, Anthony Ifeanyi; Obi, Larry Chikwelu","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51f7a2d28b34ee4c56be8e7190d40cfa4f91dd28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106291.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.04.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048075/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134819300735; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134819300735","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel swine-infecting viruses","swine herds of pig","novel members","viral pathogens","Detection of infectious viral agents","swine industry","new swine parvoviruses","selective novel molecular techniques","application of novel molecular methods","epidemiology of novel porcine parvoviruses","pig-infecting member","Timely detection","countries","day","African sub-region","epidemiological study of viral diseases of economic importance","subfamily Parvovirinae","African continent","surveillance initiatives","family Parvoviridae","implementation of effective control","prevalence","usage","reported cases","metagenomics","up-to-date highlights","concise overview","gear","prevention","dearth of information","increase","characterization","spread","occurrence","advent","ceaseless efforts","review","contrary","observation","list","group","zoonotic potentials","decade","story"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, a wide-ranging systematic search of electronic databases from which to draw conclusions was conducted. All randomized controlled trials concerning the GLED plus conventional treatments for CCP were selected in the present study. Main outcomes were treatment efficacy, blood gas and hemorrheology indexes, and adverse events. Data from 28 trials with 2457 CCP patients were analyzed. The results indicated that, compared with conventional treatments alone, the combination of conventional treatments with GLED obviously improved the markedly effective rate (RR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.31\u20131.58, P \u003C 0.00001) and total effective rate (RR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.18\u20131.38, P \u003C 0.00001). Moreover, the hemorrheology (PaO(2), P \u003C 0.00001; PaCO(2), P \u003C 0.00001; SaO(2), P \u003C 0.00001; pH value, P = 0.05) and blood gas indexes (PV, WBHSV, WBMSV, WBLSV, hematocrit and FBG, P \u003C 0.01) of CCP patients were also significantly ameliorated after the combined therapy. The frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups (P \u003E 0.05). In summary, evidence from the meta-analysis suggested that the combination of conventional treatments and GLED appeared to be effective and relatively safe for CCP. Therefore, GLED mediated therapy could be recommended as an adjuvant treatment for CCP.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Jian; Guo, Yijun; Xu, Xin; Yue, Hongmei; Yang, Yapei","journal":"Biosci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cdb4118771d5dd2bcd48fdc92397e78c21f10e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7069918.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32124923/; https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20200099","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ginkgo","GLED","CCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCP patients","safety of GLED","combination of conventional treatments","GLED mediated therapy","blood gas indexes","treatment efficacy","hemorrheology indexes","adjuvant treatment","total effective rate","promising supplementary treatment","frequency of adverse events","meta-analysis","combined therapy","randomized controlled trials","WBHSV","WBMSV","WBLSV","PV","chronic cor pulmonale","dipyridamole injection","hematocrit","Ginkgo leaf extract","kind of Chinese herbal medicine preparation","wide-ranging systematic search of electronic databases","Main outcomes","FBG","exact effects","summary","evidence","pH value","published literature","conclusions","present study","PaO","PaCO","SaO","results","groups"],"language":"en"},

It is desirable to determine the pathogen of HFMD accurately and quickly for early treatment.

The efficacy of detecting EV71 was compared with regular nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After detecting 108 clinical specimens, results showed that RT-LAMP can specifically detect EV71, but not Coxsackie virus A16, and exhibited a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 97.1%, which was higher than regular RT-PCR. The findings indicate that RT-LAMP is a practical method for EV71 diagnostic applications, particularly in small county institutes of medical service.

Nonetheless, the agents that induce these phenomena are most often specific for a given virus or virus family. Drugs developed for HIV treatment were reevaluated for use against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during and after the epidemic in 2003, in view of the absence of any other available treatment. Of the protease and entry inhibitors approved for treating HIV-infected patients, none was effective against SARS-CoV, although in vitro activity against this virus was reported for the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, in results that have not been confirmed in the most recent studies.

In the first a husband, wife, and 4 children had Crohn\u0027s disease; in the second 7 of 11 children had the disease. There was no history of Crohn\u0027s disease in antecedent generations and no linkage to HLA haplotypes. Methods: Methods included family interviews; review of medical records, radiographs, and pathology slides; serology; selective stool culture; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for fecal viral detection; and immunocytochemistry. Results: In both families multiple cases occurred among siblings in 7\u201313-month periods. There appeared to be a 4\u20138-year recurrence of new disease in both families. Radiographs showed a remarkable similarity in the pattern of disease, confined to distal ileum and cecum, in the members of family 1. Examination for pathology showed granulomas in all 8 patients for whom tissues were available. Acid-fast organisms or Campylobacter-like organisms were not found in tissue sections, and immunocytochemistry was negative for mycobacteria and Yersinia. Stool cultures were negative for mycobacteria, Yersinia, and Mycoplasma. Torovirus and coronavirus antigens were not found in stool. Serology was negative for antibodies to Brucella, Yersinia, influenza, and three enteropathogenic viruses of animals.

The aim of this work was to amplify and diversify the autoimmune response restricted to FAH through the use of the exogenous adjuvant called PADRE. Accordingly, C57BL/6 mice were chosen, because these animals respond to PADRE better than other mouse strains. Results presented herein indicate that, surprisingly, C57BL/6 mice developed signs of autoimmune hepatitis-like disease (AIH), including transient hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated transaminases, autoAb directed against different liver proteins and hepatic cellular infiltrates, indicating that a new model of experimental AIH could be generated by a viral inoculation. Furthermore, PADRE administration amplified the MHV effect, extending the duration of hypergammaglobulinemia and increasing the binding of autoAb as well as the degree of hepatic infiltrates. However, the adjuvant did not expand the time of the symptoms. Additionally, since plasmatic uric acid and high-mobility group box protein 1 (HGMB1) concentrations augmented in MHV- and/or PADRE-treated mice, it is suggested that both alarmins were probably involved in the spreading of the immune response induced by the viral infection and the adjuvant administration.","publish_time":"2011-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aparicio, Jos\u00E9 L.; Pe\u00F1a, Clara; Retegui, Lilia A.","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40b42a7a9cd69c4d366ee2b759fbb8160e73ce40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106302.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2011.05.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576911002311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21635973/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576911002311","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIH","PADRE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PADRE administration","PADRE-treated mice","MHV A59","adjuvant administration","FAH","Mouse hepatitis virus A59","binding of autoAb","MHV effect","autoimmune response","various mouse strains","exogenous adjuvant","C57BL","hepatic cellular infiltrates","signs of autoimmune hepatitis","degree of hepatic infiltrates","transient hypergammaglobulinemia","duration of hypergammaglobulinemia","viral infection","viral inoculation","different liver proteins","new model of experimental AIH","high-mobility group box protein","HGMB1","kidneys","autoantibodies","soluble cytosolic enzyme present","elevated transaminases","plasmatic uric acid","disease","fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase","concentrations","spreading","time","animals","aim","work","symptoms","alarmins","Results"],"language":"en"},

Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of COVID-19 patients.

Hypothesis: Dogs and cats housed in an animal shelter and administered a probiotic are less likely to have diarrhea of \u22652 days duration than untreated controls. Animals: Two hundred and seventeen cats and 182 dogs. Methods: Double blinded and placebo controlled. Shelter dogs and cats were housed in 2 separate rooms for each species. For 4 weeks, animals in 1 room for each species was fed Enterococcus faecium SF68 while animals in the other room were fed a placebo. After a 1\u2010week washout period, the treatments by room were switched and the study continued an additional 4 weeks. A standardized fecal score system was applied to feces from each animal every day by a blinded individual. Feces of animals with and without diarrhea were evaluated for enteric parasites. Data were analyzed by a generalized linear mixed model using a binomial distribution with treatment being a fixed effect and the room being a random effect. Results: The percentage of cats with diarrhea \u22652 days was significantly lower (P= .0297) in the probiotic group (7.4%) when compared with the placebo group (20.7%).

Unlike envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the transmembrane glycoprotein El is glycosylated normally in the presence of tunicamycin. This suggests that glycosylation of El does not involve transfer of core oligosaccharides from dolichol pyrophosphate intermediates to asparagine residues, but may occur by 0-linked glycosylation of serine or threonine residues. Synthesis of the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 is not readily detectable in the presence of tunicamycin. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of E2 by tunicamycin either prevents synthesis or facilitates degradation of the protein moiety of E2. Radiolabeling with carbohydrate precursors and borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides show that different oligcsaccharide side chains are attached to El and E2. The two coronavirus envelope glycoproteins thus appear to be glycosylated by different mechanisms. In tunicamycin-treated cells, noninfectious virions lacking peplomers are formed at intracytoplasmic membranes and released from the cells. These virions contain normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein and glycosylated El, but lack E2. Thus the transmembrane glycoprotein El is the only viral glycoprotein required for the formation of the viral envelope or for virus maturation and release. The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 appears to be required for attachment to virus receptors on the plasma membrane. The coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein E1 appears to be a novel type of viral glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated by a tunicamycin-resistant process that yields oligosaccharide side chains different from those of N-linked glycoproteins. These findings suggest that El may be particularly useful as a model for studying the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and intracellular transport of 0-linked glycoproteins.","publish_time":"1981-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holmes, Kathryn V.; Doller, Elizabeth W.; Sturman, Lawrence S.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5178260b84dc4639c9287f916e3709c84a0ff39.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268228190115X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268228190115X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["linked glycosylation of E2","peplomeric glycoprotein E2","coronavirus envelope glycoproteins","coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein E1","viral envelope","transmembrane glycoprotein","presence of tunicamycin","N-linked glycoproteins","Abstract Tunicamycin","lack E2","linked glycosylation of serine","envelope glycoproteins of mouse hepatitis virus","chains different","novel type of viral glycoprotein","tunicamycin-treated cells","protein moiety of E2","tunicamycin-resistant process","different oligcsaccharide","different effects","different mechanisms","virus receptors","virus maturation","noninfectious virions","asparagine residues","threonine residues","Inhibition of N","normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein","dolichol pyrophosphate intermediates","borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides","peplomers","transfer of core oligosaccharides","MHV","intracellular transport","degradation","carbohydrate precursors","biosynthesis","attachment","formation","viruses","intracytoplasmic membranes","plasma membrane","model","release","findings"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We reviewed clinical histories of 276 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and extracted data on patients who met the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 severe/fatal pneumonia and had an acute exacerbation starting with mild or common pneumonia. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included. Of these, 8% were smokers, 54% had been to Wuhan, and 46% had comorbidities. Before acute exacerbation, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (232.9 \u00B1 88.7) was present, and chest CT scans showed the number of involved lobes was 4 (2\u20135) and total CT score was 6 (2\u20138). Following acute exacerbation, patients were likely to have more clinical symptoms (p \u003C 0.01) and abnormal laboratory changes (p \u003C 0.01). The number of involved lobes and CT score after an exacerbation significantly increased to 5 (5\u20135) and 12 (9\u201314), respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that, when the cutoff value of CT score was 5, the sensitivity and specificity for severe pneumonia were 90% and 70%, respectively. CT findings of ground glass opacity with consolidations (91.7%), bilateral distribution (100.0%), and multifocal lesion (100.0%) were features in found in patients after exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant changes in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients from disease onset to exacerbation. An increase in the number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict poor clinical outcomes. Combining an assessment of CT changes with clinical and laboratory changes could help clinical teams evaluate the prognosis. KEY POINTS: \u2022 The common chest CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia after exacerbation were ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation, bilateral distribution, and multifocal lesions. \u2022 An increase in number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict a poor clinical outcome. \u2022 Worsened symptoms and abnormal laboratory results are also associated with poor prognosis.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jiayi; Chen, Taili; Yang, Haitao; Cai, Yeyu; Yu, Qizhi; Chen, Juan; Chen, Zhu; Shang, Quan-Liang; Ma, Cong; Chen, Xiangyu; Xiao, Enhua","journal":"Eur Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e4a5db98959ebbf76c61cfe584e518f64be7bda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385648/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06916-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","increased CT score","acute exacerbation","assessment of CT changes","total CT score","clinical symptoms","clinical histories","clinical teams","chest CT scans","cutoff value of CT score","number of involved lobes","poor clinical outcomes","common chest CT signs of COVID","abnormal laboratory changes","CT findings of ground glass opacity","common pneumonia","severe pneumonia","radiological changes","fatal pneumonia","significant changes","abnormal laboratory results","disease onset","confirmed COVID","poor prognosis","baseline","bilateral distribution","coronavirus infectious disease","Worsened symptoms","multifocal lesions","GGO","consolidations","sensitivity","diagnostic criteria","curve","elevated lactate dehydrogenase","data","KEY POINTS","Receiver","characteristic","ROC","specificity","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","Wuhan","comorbidities","smokers"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we exploited a live attenuated SG mutant, JOL967, to deliver spike (S) protein 1 of IB virus (V) to elicit protective immunity against both FT and IB in chickens. The codon optimized S1 nucleotide sequence was cloned in-frame into a prokaryotic constitutive expression vector, pJHL65. Subsequently, empty pJHL65 or recombinant pJHL65-S1 plasmid was electroporated into JOL967 and the resultant clones were designated as JOL2068 and JOL2077, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the chickens vaccinated once orally with JOL2077 elicited significantly (p \u003C 0.05) higher IBV-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity compared to JOL2068 and PBS control groups. Consequently, on challenge with the virulent IBV strain at 28(th) day post-vaccination, JOL2077 vaccinated birds displayed significantly (p \u003C 0.05) lower inflammatory lesions in virus-targeted tissues compared to control groups. Furthermore, 33.3% (2 of 6) of birds vaccinated with JOL2077 vaccine had shown virus recovery from tracheal tissues compared to 100% (6 of 6) recovery obtained in both the control groups. Against wild-type SG lethal challenge, both JOL2077 and JOL2068 vaccinated groups exhibited only 10% mortality compared to 80% mortality observed in PBS control group. In conclusion, we show that JOL2077 can induce efficient IBV- and carrier-specific protective immunity and can act as a bivalent vaccine against FT and IB. Further studies are warranted to investigate the potential of JOL2077 vaccine in broiler and young layer birds.

Sixty-nine infants (1 month to 1 year) undergoing cardiac surgery from November to May of the years 2012 to 2014 were prospectively enrolled, surveyed and tested. We compared the outcomes of positive molecular testing and positive study questionnaire to test negative subjects. We also evaluated the predictive value of study questionnaire in identification of viruses by molecular testing.

Among the 20 viruses detected, Human Rhinovirus was the most common 12 (60%). Seven (12%) of the 58 patients developed respiratory symptoms following surgery prompting molecular testing. Four of these tested positive for a respiratory virus post-surgically. Neither positive molecular testing nor a positive questionnaire prior to surgery was associated with greater post-operative HLOS, CICU LOS, intubation time, respiratory complications, or use of oxygen at discharge compared to negative testing.

Abstract Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease responsible for complications and mortality from hepatic (fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma) and extrahepatic (insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases) causes. Currently, there is no approved treatment for this indication. However, a weight loss of 5 to 10% of the initial body weight is able to improve liver histology. However, it is difficult to achieve in all patients or ineffective / not indicated if the disease is diagnosed at an irreversible cirrhosis stage. Different drugs available in the dysmetabolic context are presented (statins, metformin, etc.) with their impact on liver disease. Recently, numerous agents have shown modest but positive results. Several compounds tested in phase 2 trials are explained in this article including FXR or TGR5 agonists, PPAR\u03B1/\u03B4/\u03B3 agonists, recombinant FGF21, FGF19 analog, thyroid receptor agonist \u03B21, GLP-1 agonists, inhibitors of lipogenesis, CCR2/5 antagonist\u2026 The most advanced results concern the interim analysis of the phase 3 study on obeticholic acid (FXR agonist) which notably confirmed a regression of hepatic fibrosis with this treatment. Four other compounds are also currently tested in phase 3 trials. The multi-mechanistic strategy of a combination therapy is also discussed. Other therapeutic approaches such as obesity surgery, microbiota modulation and bariatric endoscopy are exposed.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lanthier, Nicolas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ff5be8154bed1e54b0774d3863c375e97ea70fe.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0985056220304623?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0985056220304623","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["However"],"organizations":["TGR5","FGF19"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the phase","The multi","\u00E9tude de phase","maladie h\u00E9patique","agonistes FXR","also currently tested in phase","Several compounds tested in phase","FXR agonist","agoniste FXR","histologie h\u00E9patique","it is difficult to achieve in","explained in this article including FXR","the initial body weight is able to improve liver histology","The most advanced results concern the interim analysis","r\u00E9gression de la fibrose h\u00E9patique","TGR5 agonists","\u03B3 agonists","agonistes PPAR\u03B1","agonistes GLP","this indication","Different drugs available in the dysmetabolic context","liver disease responsible","mortalit\u00E9 de cause h\u00E9patique","indicated if the disease is diagnosed at an irreversible cirrhosis stage","there is no approved treatment","combination therapy is also discussed","hepatic fibrosis with this treatment","trials","complications","FGF21 recombinant","recombinant FGF21","NASH","However","poids initial","compos\u00E9s test\u00E9s","patients or ineffective","Four other compounds","with their impact","maladie du foie responsable","FGF19 analog","microbiota modulation","thyroid receptor agonist \u03B21","weight loss","antagoniste CCR2","r\u00E9sultats modestes","cirrhose irr\u00E9versible","combinaison de traitements","nombreux traitements","traitement approuv\u00E9","perte de poids","mortality from hepatic","r\u00E9cepteur thyro\u00EFdien \u03B21","shown modest but positive results","Other therapeutic approaches such as obesity surgery","regression","which notably confirmed","study","obeticholic acid","extrahepatic","presented","insulin resistance","numerous agents","mechanistic strategy","hepatocellular carcinoma","statins","bariatric endoscopy","disposition","contexte dysm\u00E9tabolique","cardiovascular diseases","microbiote","h\u00E9patocarcinome","\u00E9valuation interm\u00E9diaire","alcoholic steatohepatitis","acide ob\u00E9ticholique","statines","causes","Recently","b\u00E9n\u00E9fice potentiel","chirurgie","ob\u00E9sit\u00E9","endoscopie bariatrique","metformine","exposed","insulinor\u00E9sistance","lipogenesis","inhibitors","maladies cardiovasculaires","lipogen\u00E8se","Abstract","point","alcoolique","pistes th\u00E9rapeutiques","Diff\u00E9rents m\u00E9dicaments","cas de diagnostic","st\u00E9atoh\u00E9patite","objectif"],"language":"fr"},

Methods Using the Baidu Index Platform (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as data resources to obtain the search volume (SV) of keywords for symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from 2017 to 2020 and the epidemic data in Hubei province and the other top 9 impacted provinces in China. Data of 2020 were compared with those of the previous three years. Data of Hubei province were compared with those of the other 9 provinces. The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlations between the SV of COVID-19 and the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases were analyzed. The lag effects were discussed. Results Comparing the SV from January 1, 2020 to February 20, 2020 with those for the same period of the previous three years, Hubei\u0027s SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea, and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P\u003C0.001). The SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases (r confirmed = 0.723, r suspected = 0.863, both P\u003C 0.001). The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who searched relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see doctors in 2-3 days later and be confirmed in 3-4 days later. Conclusion The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. It warned us to pay attention to not only the symptoms of the lower respiratory tract but also the gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19. Internet search behavior had a positive correlation with the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases, suggesting that big data has an important role in the early warning of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Hui-Jun; Yuan, Lian-Xiong; Wu, Qing-Wu; Zhou, Yu-Qi; Zheng, Rui; Huang, Xue-Kun; Yang, Qin-Tai","journal":"World Journal of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/804c56140ea5d25f0991b484e6c56b49f8052da5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095881120300639; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095881120300639?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wjorl.2020.05.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Baidu Index Platform","Center for Disease Control","SV"],"locations":["Hubei","China"],"keyphrases":["SV of COVID","SV of diarrhea","total SV of lower respiratory symptoms","upper respiratory symptoms","gastrointestinal symptoms","related symptoms","relevant symptoms","Hubei\u0027s SV","Data of Hubei province","suspected cases","lower respiratory tract","number","data resources","big data","epidemic data","Disease Control","patients","prevention","years","Results","days","Internet search behavior","symptom characteristics of Coronavirus Disease","search volume","lag effects","impacted provinces","distributed lag model","fever","cough","important role","positive correlation","website of Chinese Center","chest tightness","keywords","early warning of infectious diseases","dyspnea","Conclusion","correlations","Abstract Objective","Baidu Index Platform","Methods","China","doctors","period","differences","attention"],"language":"en"},

In a field that has traditionally relied on an established system of mandatory and voluntary reporting of known infectious diseases by doctors and laboratories to governmental agencies, innovations in social media and so-called user-generated information could lead to faster recognition of cases of infectious disease. More direct access to such data could enable surveillance epidemiologists to detect potential public health threats such as rare, new diseases or early-level warnings for epidemics. But how useful are data from social media and the Internet, and what is the potential to enhance surveillance? The challenges of using these emerging surveillance systems for infectious disease epidemiology, including the specific resources needed, technical requirements, and acceptability to public health practitioners and policymakers, have wide-reaching implications for public health surveillance in the 21st century. Methods: This article divides public health surveillance into indicator-based surveillance and event-based surveillance and provides an overview of each. We did an exhaustive review of published articles indexed in the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Scirus between 1990 and 2011 covering contemporary event-based systems for infectious disease surveillance. Findings: Our literature review uncovered no event-based surveillance systems currently used in national surveillance programs. While much has been done to develop event-based surveillance, the existing systems have limitations. Accordingly, there is a need for further development of automated technologies that monitor health-related information on the Internet, especially to handle large amounts of data and to prevent information overload. The dissemination to health authorities of new information about health events is not always efficient and could be improved. No comprehensive evaluations show whether event-based surveillance systems have been integrated into actual epidemiological work during real-time health events. Conclusions: The acceptability of data from the Internet and social media as a regular part of public health surveillance programs varies and is related to a circular challenge: the willingness to integrate is rooted in a lack of effectiveness studies, yet such effectiveness can be proved only through a structured evaluation of integrated systems. Issues related to changing technical and social paradigms in both individual perceptions of and interactions with personal health data, as well as social media and other data from the Internet, must be further addressed before such information can be integrated into official surveillance systems.","publish_time":"2014-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"VELASCO, EDWARD; AGHENEZA, TUMACHA; DENECKE, KERSTIN; KIRCHNER, G\u00D6RAN; ECKMANNS, TIM","journal":"Milbank Quarterly","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c15e397f07a1745e38a725048d7c5e02a6e1e37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3955375.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12038; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3955375?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597553/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health surveillance programs","event-based surveillance systems","surveillance epidemiologists","emerging surveillance systems","official surveillance systems","indicator-based surveillance","infectious disease surveillance","health-related information","public health practitioners","personal health data","exchange of health information","national surveillance programs","potential public health threats","health authorities of new information","real-time health events","Internet","contemporary event-based systems","social media","existing systems","acceptability of data","information overload","infectious diseases","social paradigms","structured evaluation of integrated systems","infectious disease epidemiology","large amounts of data","so-called user-generated information","new diseases","technical requirements","literature review","lack of effectiveness studies","exhaustive review of published articles","innovations","policymakers","voluntary reporting","governmental agencies","wide-reaching implications","doctors","laboratories","individual perceptions","actual epidemiological work","specific resources","faster recognition of cases","databases PubMed","development of automated technologies","interactions","established system of mandatory","Scirus","level warnings","dissemination","opportunity","comprehensive evaluations","Scopus","need","Context","Methods","limitations","challenges","century","direct access","circular challenge","willingness","epidemics","Findings","Issues","Conclusions","overview","field"],"language":"en"},

We sought to evaluate the prevalence and etiology of all community acquired viral respiratory infections requiring hospitalization during an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, with a focus on co-infection rates and clinical outcomes. Methods Over a 10-week period, all admissions to our institution, the largest tertiary hospital in Singapore, were screened for respiratory symptoms, and COVID-19 as well as a panel of common respiratory viral pathogens were systematically tested for. Information was collated on clinical outcomes, including requirement for mechanical ventilation and in hospital mortality. Results One-fifth (19.3%, 736/3807) of hospitalized inpatients with respiratory symptoms had a PCR-proven viral respiratory infection; of which 58.5% (431/736) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 42.2% (311/736) tested positive for other common respiratory viruses. The rate of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was 1.4% (8/431); all patients with co-infection had mild disease and stayed in communal settings. The in-hospital mortality rate and proportion of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive ventilation was low, at around 1% of patients; these rates were lower than patients with other community-acquired respiratory viruses admitted over the same period (p \u003C 0.01). Conclusion Even amidst an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, common respiratory viruses still accounted for a substantial proportion of hospitalizations. Coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 were rare, with no observed increase in morbidity or mortality.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wee, Liang En; Ko, Kwan Ki Karrie; Ho, Wan Qi; Kwek, Grace Teck Cheng; Tan, Thuan Tong; Wijaya, Limin","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b2199666bbbc5728f2bc4c1ee2e1bf9f6c3960d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301785; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104436; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301785?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["common respiratory viruses","respiratory symptoms","viral respiratory infections","co-infection rates","ongoing COVID","rates of co-infections","rate of co-infection","SARS-CoV","panel of common respiratory viral pathogens","co-circulation","proportion of COVID","outbreak","hospital mortality rate","community","clinical outcomes","largest tertiary hospital","mechanical ventilation","invasive ventilation","week period","substantial proportion of hospitalizations","mild disease","PCR","institution","requirement","Singapore","focus","admissions","observed increase","etiology","hospitalized inpatients","communal settings","morbidity","Abstract Aims","Methods","prevalence","Information","Conclusion","Coinfections","Results"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated whether Vero cells could be grown in serum-free and shaking suspension conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of the Vero cell suspension culture system to produce adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), compared to that of the adhesive Vero cell culture system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the feasibility of commercial serum-free media for Vero cell culture. For the adaptation of Vero cells in suspension culture, adhesive Vero cells were added in the early phase of shaking suspension culture, and 50 days after shaking suspension culture, suspension-adapted Vero cells were subcultured continuously. To assess the virus production ability of Vero cells in suspension, the cells were infected with Ad5-green fluorescent protein and evaluated based on their fluorescence intensity. RESULTS: The Vero cells grown in OptiPRO serum-free medium showed no changes in morphology and growth rate, but MRC-5 and FRhk-4 cells showed morphological changes and decreased growth rate, respectively. The Vero cells were well adapted to the suspension culture system. The Vero cells in suspension showed a better Ad5 production ability than the adherent Vero cells. CONCLUSION: Vero cells can be grown in OptiPRO serum-free medium. Further, our suspension culture-adapted Vero cells may be suitable to produce viral vaccine strains due to their high ability to produce viruses such as Ad5.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Deuk-Ki; Park, Jihye; Seo, Dong-Won","journal":"Clin Exp Vaccine Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0e75f3b4aeda66ce88ca4a58a785c8fdf32b9ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7024729.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32095440/; https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2020.9.1.48","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspension culture-adapted Vero cells","suspension-adapted Vero cells","adherent Vero cells","adhesive Vero cells","adaptation of Vero cells","Vero cell suspension culture system","virus production ability of Vero cells","adhesive Vero cell culture system","cell culture processes","suspension conditions","early phase of shaking suspension culture","adherent cell culture systems","OptiPRO serum-free medium","viral vaccine production","better Ad5 production ability","high ability","feasibility of commercial serum-free media","large amounts of viral vaccine strains","Ad5-green fluorescent protein","decreased growth rate","morphological changes","labor-intensive processes","morphology","days","adenovirus type","MRC","FRhk","viruses","PURPOSE","METHODS","study","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","fluorescence intensity","MATERIALS"],"language":"en"},

In order to identify the role of apoptosis in ASFV infection, we analyzed caspase induction during the infection and the impact of caspase inhibition on viral production. Caspases 3, 9 and 12 were activated from 16 h post-infection, but not caspase 8. Indeed, caspase 3 activation during the early stages of the infection appeared to be crucial for efficient virus exit. In addition, the inhibition of membrane blebbing reduced the release of virus particles from the cell. ASFV uses the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a site of replication and this process can trigger ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) of the host cell. In addition to caspase 12 activation, indicators of ER stress include the upregulation of the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin upon virus infection. Moreover, ASFV induces transcription factor 6 signaling pathway of the UPR, but not the protein kinase-like ER kinase or the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 pathways. Thus, the capacity of ASFV to regulate the UPR may prevent early apoptosis and ensure viral replication.","publish_time":"2012-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galindo, I; Hern\u00E1ez, B; Mu\u00F1oz-Moreno, R; Cuesta-Geijo, M A; Dalmau-Mena, I; Alonso, C","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d800e113c0f37fea4586a18115d07a7bbb3e5464.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3406580.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2012.81; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22764100/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASFV","UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection","ASFV infection","virus replication","ER kinase","caspase induction","activation","capacity of ASFV","h post-infection","impact of caspase inhibition","early apoptosis","viral replication","indicators of ER stress","release of virus particles","efficient virus exit","protein kinase","African swine fever virus","role of apoptosis","site of replication","infected cell","host cell","addition","early stages","viral production","inhibition of membrane blebbing","unfolded protein response","upregulation","chaperones calnexin","calreticulin","consequences","inositol","process","transcription factor","endoplasmic reticulum","enzyme","pathways","order","Caspases"],"language":"en"},

To create a novel infection model for PDCoV, we developed an in vitro system to generate porcine intestinal enteroids from crypts of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of pigs. Enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, stem cells, proliferating cells, and goblet cells were found in the differentiated enteroids. Replication of PDCoV was detected in the cultured enteroids by immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. Double immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated that PDCoV was present in Sox9-positive intestinal cells and Villin1-positive enterocytes. There were multiple cellular responses shown as changes of transcription of genes related to mucosal immunity, antiviral genes, and marker genes of stem cells and other cells in the enteroids infected with PDCoV.

Exuberant or dysregulated inflammation can impair gas exchange and underlies many instances of lung disease. An important driver of inflammation in the lung is the interferon (IFN) response. Type I IFNs are antiviral cytokines that induce a large range of proteins that impair viral replication in infected cells. This cell-intrinsic action plays a crucial role in protecting the lungs from spread of respiratory viruses. However, type I IFNs have also recently been found to be central to the initiation of lung inflammatory responses, by inducing recruitment and activation of immune cells. This helps control virus burden but can cause detrimental immunopathology and contribute to disease severity. Furthermore, there is now increasing evidence that type I IFNs are not only induced after viral infections but also after infection with bacteria and fungi. The pro-inflammatory function of type I IFNs in the lung opens up the possibility of immune modulation directed against this antiviral cytokine family. In this review, the initiation and signaling of type I IFNs as well as their role in driving and maintaining lung inflammation will be discussed.","publish_time":"2017-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Makris, Spyridon; Paulsen, Michelle; Johansson, Cecilia","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef720b08c80cb574e3db1e48be65750ebb4b5104.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5344902.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28344581/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFNs","lung inflammation","lung infections","initiation of lung inflammatory responses","instances of lung disease","Immune responses","pro-inflammatory function of type","viral infections","dysregulated inflammation","activation of immune cells","possibility of immune modulation","important driver of inflammation","viral replication","crucial role","antiviral cytokines","infected cells","organ function","disease severity","antiviral cytokine family","recruitment","large range of proteins","detrimental immunopathology","gas exchange","lungs","pathogen eradication","interferon","cell-intrinsic action","virus burden","bacteria","order","driving","respiratory viruses","fungi","review","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Owing to this broad range of influence, type I IFNs also exhibit critical functions in many sterile inflammatory diseases and immunopathologies, especially those associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-driven signaling pathways. Indeed, over the years accumulating evidence has indicated that the presence of ER stress can influence the production, or sensing of, type I IFNs induced by perturbations like pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists, infections (bacterial, viral or parasitic) or autoimmunity. In this article we discuss the link between type I IFNs and ER stress in various diseased contexts. We describe how ER stress regulates type I IFNs production or sensing, or how type I IFNs may induce ER stress, in various circumstances like microbial infections, autoimmunity, diabetes, cancer and other ER stress-related contexts.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sprooten, Jenny; Garg, Abhishek D.","journal":"International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64e656b48a08137d74a2e96d50f5b69c6a33ad38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104985.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1937644819301017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1937644819301017; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2019.10.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32138904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of ER stress","IFNs production","ER stress-related contexts","Abstract Type","microbial infections","autoimmunity","sensing","various diseased contexts","various circumstances","main objective of blocking pathogens-driven infections","sterile inflammatory diseases","pro-inflammatory cytokines","broad range of influence","PRR","agonists","pattern recognition receptor","cancer","diabetes","perturbations","critical functions","nucleated cells","immunopathologies","interferons","link","endoplasmic reticulum","evidence","article","pathways","years"],"language":"en"},

The assembly of the viral genome into virus particles involves viral structural proteins and is believed to be mediated through recognition of specific sequences and RNA structures of the viral genome. METHODS AND RESULTS: A culture system for the production of MERS coronavirus-like particles (MERS VLPs) was determined and established by electron microscopy and the detection of coexpressed viral structural proteins. Using the VLP system, a 258-nucleotide RNA fragment, which spans nucleotides 19,712 to 19,969 of the MERS-CoV genome (designated PS258(19712\u201319969)(ME)), was identified to function as a packaging signal. Assembly of the RNA packaging signal into MERS VLPs is dependent on the viral nucleocapsid protein. In addition, a 45-nucleotide stable stem-loop substructure of the PS258(19712\u201319969)(ME) interacted with both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of the viral nucleocapsid protein. Furthermore, a functional SARS-CoV RNA packaging signal failed to assemble into the MERS VLPs, which indicated virus-specific assembly of the RNA genome. CONCLUSIONS: A MERS-oV RNA packaging signal was identified by the detection of GFP expression following an incubation of MERS VLPs carrying the heterologous mRNA GFP-PS258(19712\u201319969)(ME) with virus permissive Huh7 cells.

The medicinal quality of herbal plants varies with the locations of cultivation, the parts of the herb collected, the season of the herb collected, and the herb processing method. Polysaccharides are major components of the herb plants and their biosynthesis is partly controlled by the genes but mostly influenced by the availability of the nutrition and determined by the various environmental factors. In recent decades, polysaccharides isolated from different kinds of Chinese herbs have received much attention due to their important biological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, radiation protecting, antiviral, hypolipidemic, and immunomodulatory activities. Interestingly, different batches of the same herb can obtain different polysaccharide fractions with subtle differences in molecular weight, monosaccharide compositions, glycosidic linkages, and biological functions. Even with these variations, a large number of bioactive polysaccharides from different kinds of traditional Chinese herbs have been purified, characterized, and reported. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the latest polysaccharide extraction methods and the strategies used for monosaccharide compositional analysis plus polysaccharide structural characterization. Most importantly, the reported chemical characteristics and biological activities of the polysaccharides from the famous traditional Chinese herbs including Astragalus membranaceus, Ginseng, Lycium barbarum, Angelica sinensis, Cordyceps sinensis, and Ophiopogon japonicus will be reviewed and discussed. The published studies provide evidence that polysaccharides from traditional Chinese herbs play an important role in their medical applications, which forms the basis for future research, development, and application of these polysaccharides as functional foods and therapeutics in modern medicine.","publish_time":"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Pengjiao; Li, Juan; Chen, Yulong; Zhang, Lijuan","journal":"Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c137574e50a7761a78cd76c956e8547efa3c1b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102684.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877117319300377; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877117319300377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030757/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2019.03.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Angelica"],"organizations":["Ophiopogon"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["herb plants","different kinds of traditional Chinese herbs","different kinds of Chinese herbs","famous traditional Chinese herbs","traditional Chinese medicine substances","different polysaccharide fractions","important biological activities","different batches","herb processing method","large number of bioactive polysaccharides","anti-tumor","anti-diabetic","anti-oxidant","immunomodulatory activities","biological functions","medicinal quality of herbal plants","polysaccharide structural characterization","monosaccharide compositions","Cordyceps sinensis","Angelica sinensis","latest polysaccharide extraction methods","important role","modern medicine","monosaccharide compositional analysis","reported chemical characteristics","molecular weight","Ginseng","Astragalus membranaceus","Lycium barbarum","subtle differences","strategies","glycosidic linkages","antiviral","radiation","functional foods","evidence","comprehensive summary","basis","development","therapeutics","attention","future research","medical applications","hypolipidemic","locations of cultivation","major components","Ophiopogon japonicus","published studies","recent decades","nutrition","variations","parts","biosynthesis","various environmental factors","availability","genes","review","season"],"language":"en"},

In the meantime, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and the concern over pandemic influenza have stimulated considerable government and health care institutional efforts to improve infection control systems in Canada. Methods In 2006, a version of the RICH survey similar to the original RICH instrument was mailed to infection control programs in all Canadian acute care hospitals with 80 or more beds. We used \u03C72, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance analyses to test for differences between the 1999 and 2005 samples for infection control program components and ARO rates. Results 72.3% of Canadian acute care hospitals completed the RICH survey for 1999 and 60.1% for 2005. Hospital size was controlled for in analyses involving AROs and surveillance and control intensity levels. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates increased from 1999 to 2005 (F = 9.4, P = .003). In 2005, the mean MRSA rate was 5.2 (standard deviation [SD], 6.1) per 1000 admissions, and, in 1999, it was 2.0 (SD, 2.9). Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea rates trended up from 1999 to 2005 (F = 2.9, P = .09). In 2005, the mean Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea rate was 4.7 (SD, 4.3), and, in 1999, it was 3.8 (SD, 4.3). The proportion of hospitals that reported having new nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) cases was greater in 2005 than in 1999 (\u03C72 = 10.5, P = .001). In 1999, 34.5% (40/116) of hospitals reported having new nosocomial VRE cases, and, in 2005, 61.0% (64/105) reported new cases. Surveillance intensity index scores increased from a mean of 61.7 (SD, 18.5) in 1999 to 68.1 (SD, 15.4) in 2005 (F = 4.1, P = .04). Control intensity index scores trended upward slightly from a mean of 60.8 (SD, 14.6) in 1999 to 64.1 (SD, 12.2) in 2005 (F = 3.2, P = .07). Infection control professionals (ICP) full-time equivalents (FTEs) per 100 beds increased from a mean of 0.5 (SD, 0.2) in 1999 to 0.8 (SD, 0.3) in 2005 (F = 90.8, P \u003C .0001). However, the proportion of ICPs in hospitals certified by the Certification Board of Infection Control decreased from 53% (SD, 46) in 1999 to 38% (SD, 36) in 2005 (F = 8.7, P = .004). Conclusion Canadian infection control programs in 2005 continued to fall short of expert recommendations for human resources and surveillance and control activities. Meanwhile, nosocomial MRSA rates more than doubled between 1999 and 2005, and hospitals reporting new nosocomial VRE cases increased 77% over the same period. Although investments have been made toward infection control programs in Canadian acute care hospitals, the rapid rise in ICP positions has not yet translated into marked improvements in surveillance and control activities. In the face of substantial increases in ARO rates in Canada, continued efforts to train ICPs and support hospital infection control programs are necessary.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zoutman, Dick E.; Ford, B.

In this case report, we describe our experience in detection of SARS-COV-2 from a confirmed patient using nucleic acid test of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid (BALF) samples but not nasopharyngeal swabs. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of severely ill SARS-COV-2 infected 46-year-old man with fever, coughing and chest tightness. We performed viral detection using his BALF samples and imaging method (CT) for confirmation. The patient received combination of interferonalfa-1b and ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir for antiviral treatment at different stages. Other medication was also given to him in combination for anti-inflammation, intestinal microbial regulation, phlegm elimination, liver protection and pulmonary fibrosis prevention purposes. We provided oxygen supply to him using BIPAP ventilator and high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument to facilitate respiration. The patient was cured and discharged. CONCLUSION: This case report described an effective supportive medication scheme to treat SARS-COV-2 infected patient and emphasized the necessity of detection of the viral genome using BALF samples and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Peiyan; Cai, Zhao; Wu, Weibo; Peng, Ling; Li, Yinfeng; Chen, Chuming; Chen, Li; Li, Jianming; Cao, Mengli; Feng, Shiyan; Jiang, Xiao; Yuan, Jing; Liu, Yingxia; Yang, Liang; Wang, Fuxiang","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edc65ac984b83d5b47d49f52e492163549685b4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191555.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05045-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["detection of SARS","BALF samples","ill SARS-COV","viral detection","infected patient","case report","Nucleic acid detection","necessity of detection","confirmed patient","CASE PRESENTATION","diagnosis of COVID","human","novel coronavirus disease","nucleic acid test of bronchoalveolar","viral genome","oxygen supply","combination of interferonalfa","effective supportive medication scheme","high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument","liver protection","phlegm elimination","intestinal microbial regulation","ritonavir","BIPAP ventilator","lavage fluid","pulmonary fibrosis prevention purposes","antiviral treatment","anti-inflammation","imaging method","ribavirin","lopinavir","fever","significance","experience","gold standard","different stages","respiration","year-old man","China","Wuhan","Hubei","confirmation","outbreak","prognosis","BACKGROUND","nasopharyngeal swabs","chest tightness","cases of infection","CONCLUSION","various countries"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to evaluate and interpret Google search queries for terms related to the Ebola outbreak both at the global level and in all countries where primary cases of Ebola occurred. The study also endeavoured to look at the correlation between the number of overall and weekly web searches and the number of overall and weekly new cases of Ebola. METHODS: Google Trends (GT) was used to explore Internet activity related to Ebola. The study period was from 29 December 2013 to 14 June 2015. Pearson\u2019s correlation was performed to correlate Ebola-related relative search volumes (RSVs) with the number of weekly and overall Ebola cases. Multivariate regression was performed using Ebola-related RSV as a dependent variable, and the overall number of Ebola cases and the Human Development Index were used as predictor variables. RESULTS: The greatest RSV was registered in the three West African countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic. The queries varied in the different countries. Both quantitative and qualitative differences between the affected African countries and other Western countries with primary cases were noted, in relation to the different flux volumes and different time courses. In the affected African countries, web query search volumes were mostly concentrated in the capital areas. However, in Western countries, web queries were uniformly distributed over the national territory. In terms of the three countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic, the correlation between the number of new weekly cases of Ebola and the weekly GT index varied from weak to moderate. The correlation between the number of Ebola cases registered in all countries during the study period and the GT index was very high. CONCLUSION: Google Trends showed a coarse-grained nature, strongly correlating with global epidemiological data, but was weaker at country level, as it was prone to distortions induced by unbalanced media coverage and the digital divide. Global and local health agencies could usefully exploit GT data to identify disease-related information needs and plan proper communication strategies, particularly in the case of health-threatening events.

Existing solutions generally target expert users and often have unclear scope, making it challenging to critically evaluate their performance. There is a growing need for intuitive analytical tooling for researchers lacking specialist computing expertise and that is applicable in diverse experimental circumstances. Notable technical challenges have impeded progress; for example, fragments of viral genomes are typically orders of magnitude less abundant than those of host, bacteria, and/or other organisms in clinical and environmental metagenomes; observed viral genomes often deviate considerably from reference genomes demanding use of exhaustive alignment approaches; high intrapopulation viral diversity can lead to ambiguous sequence reconstruction; and finally, the relatively few documented viral reference genomes compared to the estimated number of distinct viral taxa renders classification problematic. Various software tools have been developed to accommodate the unique challenges and use cases associated with characterizing viral sequences; however, the quality of these tools varies, and their use often necessitates computing expertise or access to powerful computers, thus limiting their usefulness to many researchers. In this review, we consider the general and application-specific challenges posed by viral sequencing and analysis, outline the landscape of available tools and methodologies, and propose ways of overcoming the current barriers to effective analysis.","publish_time":"2016-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rose, Rebecca; Constantinides, Bede; Tapinos, Avraam; Robertson, David L; Prosperi, Mattia","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b881730788724e674806854f0c20fec32ee9d96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5822887.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29492275/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vew022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral sequencing","fragments of viral genomes","documented viral reference genomes","characterizing viral sequences","high intrapopulation viral diversity","estimated number of distinct viral taxa","analytical approaches","unique challenges","researchers","performance","use of exhaustive alignment approaches","specialist computing expertise","application-specific challenges","Notable technical challenges","landscape of available tools","Various software tools","effective analysis","intuitive analytical tooling","Genome sequencing technologies","impeded progress","example","reconstructing","mixed samples","expert users","powerful computers","remarkable pace","access","cases","environmental metagenomes","growing need","classification problematic","organisms","current barriers","ways","methodologies","ambiguous sequence reconstruction","magnitude","diverse experimental circumstances","bacteria","host","Existing solutions","unclear scope","usefulness","quality","usability","review"],"language":"en"},

Pharyngeal swabs were performed at the first visit and if new symptoms were present. Molecular multiplex assay for 12 respiratory viruses was performed by the regional reference laboratory. Among 264 swabs from 193 outpatients, 58 (22 %) resulted positive for 61 viruses (influenza, n = 20; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], n = 21; rhinovirus, n = 12; coronavirus, n = 4; adenovirus, n = 3; parainfluenza, n = 1).

The characteristics of hMPV-infected adults are unclear because few cases have been reported. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of hospitalized adult patients with a positive multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result from 2012 to 2016 at a single tertiary referral hospital in South Korea. We analyzed clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients and divided patients into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) group and a non-ARDS group. RESULTS: In total, 110 adults were reviewed in this study. Their mean age was 61.4 years, and the majority (n = 105, 95.5%) had comorbidities or were immunocompromised. Most of the patients had pneumonia on chest X-ray (n = 88, 93.6%), 22 (20.0%) had ARDS, and 12 (10.9%) expired during hospitalization. The mortality rate for patients with ARDS was higher than that of the other patients (36.4% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). The risk factor for hMPV-associated ARDS was heart failure (odds ratio, 5.24; P = 0.044) and laboratory values were increased blood urea nitrogen and increased C-reactive protein. The acquisition site of infection was divided into community vs. nosocomial; 43 patients (39.1%) had a nosocomial infection. The risk factors for nosocomial infection were an immunocompromised state, malignancy and immunosuppressive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that hMPV is one of the important respiratory pathogens important respiratory pathogen that causes pneumonia/ARDS in elderly, immunocompromised individuals and that it may be transmitted via the nosocomial route.","publish_time":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Hyunjung; Kim, Yujin; Park, Jeong-Woong; Jeong, Sung Hwan; Kyung, Sun Young","journal":"Korean J Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddf5a29103d06a6ab0fef7f8c15c169050e493c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6786705.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31723632/; https://doi.org/10.4266/kjccm.2017.00038","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["divided patients","respiratory virus","enrolled patients","nosocomial infection","hMPV-associated ARDS","respiratory syncytial virus infection","important respiratory pathogens important respiratory pathogen","non-ARDS group","characteristics of hMPV","respiratory symptoms similar","nosocomial route","acute respiratory distress syndrome","retrospective review of hospitalized adult patients","pneumonia","immunocompromised state","immunocompromised individuals","acquisition site of infection","infected adults","risk factors","clinical characteristics","increased blood urea nitrogen","increased C-reactive protein","positive multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result","laboratory values","heart failure","odds ratio","single tertiary referral hospital","South Korea","malignancy","years","immunosuppressive treatment","chest X-ray","elderly","children","community","mortality rate","cases","BACKGROUND","Human metapneumovirus","mean age","METHODS","RESULTS","total","majority","CONCLUSIONS","data","comorbidities","study","hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we report the current diagnostic capabilities and bio-safety measures applied to diagnostic procedures in these referral centers. Overall, 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries were evaluated. Although 81% of these referral centers are located near a biosafety level 3 laboratory, 11% and 31% of them still performed their microbiological and routine diagnostic analyses, respectively, without bio-safety measures. CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancies among the referral centers surveyed between the level of practices and the European Network of Infectious Diseases (EUNID) recommendations have multiple reasons of which the interest of the individuals in charge and the investment they put in preparedness to emerging outbreaks.

Therapy is aiming at symptom regression, avoidance of complications, reduction in the number of disease-related absences in school or at work, increased cost-effectiveness and improved quality of life. The purpose of this part of the guideline is to provide clinicians in any setting with a clinically focused multi-disciplinary guidance through different conservative treatment options in order to reduce inappropriate variation in clinical care, improve clinical outcome and reduce harm. Surgical management in terms of intracapsular as well as extracapsular tonsillectomy (i.e. tonsillotomy) is the subject of part II of this guideline. To estimate the probability of tonsillitis caused by \u03B2-hemolytic streptococci, a diagnostic scoring system according to Centor or McIsaac is suggested. If therapy is considered, a positive score of \u22653 should lead to pharyngeal swab or rapid test or culture in order to identify \u03B2-hemolytic streptococci. Routinely performed blood tests for acute tonsillitis are not indicated. After acute streptococcal tonsillitis, there is no need to repeat a pharyngeal swab or any other routine blood tests, urine examinations or cardiological diagnostics such as ECG. The determination of the antistreptolysin O-titer (ASLO titer) and other antistreptococcal antibody titers do not have any value in relation to acute tonsillitis with or without pharyngitis and should not be performed. First-line therapy of \u03B2-hemolytic streptococci consists of oral penicillin. Instead of phenoxymethylpenicillin\u2013potassium (penicillin V potassium), also phenoxymethlpenicillin\u2013benzathine with a clearly longer half-life can be used. Oral intake for 7 days of one of both the drugs is recommended. Alternative treatment with oral cephalosporins (e.g. cefadroxil, cefalexin) is indicated only in cases of penicillin failure, frequent recurrences, and whenever a more reliable eradication of \u03B2-hemolytic streptococci is desirable. In cases of allergy or incompatibility of penicillin, cephalosporins or macrolides (e.g. Erythromycin-estolate) are valuable alternatives.","publish_time":"2016-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Windfuhr, Jochen P.; Toepfner, Nicole; Steffen, Gregor; Waldfahrer, Frank; Berner, Reinhard","journal":"Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc8b17c3a80a852dd2327ebb5971dde87b92004f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087627.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-015-3872-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26755048/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["McIsaac"],"organizations":["ECG"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["\u03B2-hemolytic streptococci","oral penicillin","acute streptococcal tonsillitis","probability of tonsillitis","repeated episodes of acute tonsillitis","line therapy of \u03B2","incompatibility of penicillin","oral cephalosporins","penicillin V potassium","cases of penicillin failure","order","reliable eradication of \u03B2","pharyngeal swab","Oral intake","guideline","routine blood tests","ASLO titer","clinical care","clinical outcome","Alternative treatment","cases of allergy","antistreptolysin O-titer","different conservative treatment options","work","focused multi-disciplinary guidance","urine examinations","increased cost-effectiveness","school","inappropriate variation","diagnostic scoring system","culture","cardiological diagnostics","reduction","number of disease","related absences","phenoxymethlpenicillin","macrolides","rapid test","value","improved quality of life","terms of intracapsular","avoidance of complications","Erythromycin-estolate","symptom regression","frequent recurrences","antistreptococcal antibody titers","setting","Centor","benzathine","Germany","cefalexin","cefadroxil","phenoxymethylpenicillin","need","extracapsular tonsillectomy","tonsillotomy","Surgical management","valuable alternatives","McIsaac","ECG","determination","days","relation","longer half-life","subject","clinicians","harm","positive score","pharyngitis","drugs","patients","purpose"],"language":"en"},

In fact, the total number of the patients with acute malaria in Japan has been around 100\u2013150 annually for the last 10 years. Of those, about 75% are Japanese and 25% are foreigners, and about 75% are male and 25% are female. The peak age is in the 20s. Recently, about 45% of patients are Plasmodium falciparum and another 45% Plasmodium vivax infections. The former species is likely to be seen in travelers coming back from African countries and the latter is mainly from Asian countries. The important issue is that patients in Japan have not been diagnosed promptly nor treated properly because doctors in Japan are no longer familiar with tropical medicine. Therefore, some patients are dying from severe malaria as a consequence. As it is, most of the effective medicines for drug-resistant malaria or severe malaria have not been registered in Japan. There is now a need for medical practitioners to focus on travel medicine in Japan.","publish_time":"2004-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kano, Shigeyuki; Kimura, Mikio","journal":"Acta Tropica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c05460d903238444f33dc1df904f24fd3a52222.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110222.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X03002729; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001706X03002729","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["severe malaria","acute malaria","induced malaria","imported malaria cases","drug-resistant malaria","patients","transfusion-transmitted malaria cases","Japanese doctors","number of foreigners","number of Japanese people","total number","Plasmodium falciparum","travel medicine","tropical medicine","African countries","Asian countries","Plasmodium vivax infections","medical practitioners","effective medicines","travelers","important issue","World War","need","fact","chance","consequence","peak age","species","millions","years"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, there is still not a single proven effective drug available, and therefore, current therapeutic guidelines recommend supportive care including oxygen administration and treatment with antibiotics. Recently, patients have been also treated with off-label therapies which comprise antiretrovirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, antiparasitic agents and plasma from convalescent patients, all with controversial results. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and plays a pivotal role in viral replication processes. In this review, we discuss several aspects of the UPS and the effects of its inhibition with particular regard to the life cycle of the coronaviruses (CoVs). In fact, proteasome inhibition by various chemical compounds, such as MG132, epoxomycin and bortezomib, may reduce the virus entry into the eucariotic cell, the synthesis of RNA, and the subsequent protein expression necessary for CoVs. Importantly, since UPS inhibitors reduce the cytokine storm associated with various inflammatory conditions, it is reasonable to assume that they might be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2, thus providing an additional tool to counteract both virus replication as well as its most deleterious consequences triggered by abnormal immunological response.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Longhitano, Lucia; Tibullo, Daniele; Giallongo, Cesarina; Lazzarino, Giacomo; Tartaglia, Nicola; Galimberti, Sara; Li Volti, Giovanni; Palumbo, Giuseppe Alberto; Liso, Arcangelo","journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32443911/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21103622","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteasome inhibition","virus replication","CoVs","UPS inhibitors","SARS-CoV","various chemical compounds","anti-inflammatory compounds","convalescent patients","virus entry","various inflammatory conditions","viral replication processes","ubiquitin-proteasome system","supportive care","antiparasitic agents","oxygen administration","current therapeutic guidelines","antiretrovirals","plasma","cytokine storm","pivotal role","life cycle","synthesis of RNA","treatment","eucariotic cell","subsequent protein expression necessary","particular regard","MG132","effects","single proven effective drug available","deleterious consequences","maintenance of cellular homeostasis","abnormal immunological response","bortezomib","fact","label therapies","global pandemic","social issue","antibiotics","controversial results","coronaviruses","epoxomycin","aspects","additional tool","COVID","review"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the first crystal structure of the arterivirus nsp11 protein from PRRSV, which exhibits a unique structure and assembles into an asymmetric dimer whose structure is completely different from the hexameric structure of coronavirus nsp15. However, the structures of the PRRSV nsp11 and coronavirus nsp15 catalytic domains were perfectly superimposed, especially in the \u201Cactive site loop\u201D (His129 to His144) and \u201Csupporting loop\u201D (Val162 to Thr179) regions. Importantly, our biochemical data demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 exists mainly as a dimer in solution. Mutations of the major dimerization site determinants (Ser74 and Phe76) in the dimerization interface destabilized the dimer in solution and severely diminished endoribonuclease activity, indicating that the dimer is the biologically functional unit. In the dimeric structure, the active site loop and supporting loop are packed against one another and stabilized by monomer-monomer interactions. These findings may help elucidate the mechanism underlying arterivirus replication and may represent great potential for the development of antiviral drugs. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a member of the family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales. PRRSV is a major agent of respiratory diseases in pigs, causing tremendous economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. The PRRSV nsp11 endoribonuclease plays a vital role in arterivirus replication, but its precise roles and mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Here, we report the first dimeric structure of the arterivirus nsp11 from PRRSV at 2.75-\u212B resolution. Structural and biochemical experiments demonstrated that nsp11 exists mainly as a dimer in solution and that nsp11 may be fully active as a dimer. Mutagenesis and structural analysis revealed NendoU active site residues, which are conserved throughout the order Nidovirales (families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae) and the major determinants of dimerization (Ser74 and Phe76) in Arteriviridae. Importantly, these findings may provide a new structural basis for antiviral drug development.","publish_time":"2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Yuejun; Li, Youwen; Lei, Yingying; Ye, Gang; Shen, Zhou; Sun, Limeng; Luo, Rui; Wang, Dang; Fu, Zhen F.; Xiao, Shaobo; Peng, Guiqing","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c1e7d31ff353e605f4211eebae16eaea9defed6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4836315.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03065-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26912626/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV nsp11 endoribonuclease","arterivirus nsp11 protein","RNA endoribonuclease nsp11","arterivirus replication","active site loop","dimeric structure","crystal structure","unique structure","asymmetric dimer","major dimerization site determinants","hexameric structure of coronavirus nsp15","major determinants of dimerization","NendoU active site residues","respiratory syndrome virus","major agent of respiratory diseases","Ser74","structural analysis","Phe76","dimerization interface","family Arteriviridae","families Arteriviridae","order Nidovirales","findings","new structural basis","IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive","diminished endoribonuclease activity","antiviral drug development","development of antiviral drugs","monomer-monomer interactions","vital role","crucial role","coronavirus nsp15 catalytic domains","biochemical experiments","biochemical data","pigs","tremendous economic losses","Coronaviridae","XendoU superfamily","great potential","precise roles","member","swine industry","Mutagenesis","His144","His129","Mutations","mechanisms of action","Val162","Thr179","structures","\u212B resolution","regions","functional unit"],"language":"en"},

However, the molecular mechanism of luteolin-mediated immune modulation has not been fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of luteolin on the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), as well as the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03B1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S and peripheral macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Luteolin dose-dependently inhibited the expression and production of these inflammatory genes and mediators in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay further confirmed the suppression of LPS-induced TNF- \u03B1, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 gene expression by luteolin at a transcriptional level. Luteolin also reduced the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03BAB) in LPS-activated macrophages. Moreover, luteolin blocked the degradation of I\u03BAB-\u03B1 and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03BAB p65 subunit. In addition, luteolin significantly inhibited the LPS-induced DNA binding activity of activating protein-1 (AP-1). We also found that luteolin attenuated the LPS-mediated protein kinase B (Akt) and IKK phosphorylation, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In sum, these data suggest that, by blocking NF-\u03BAB and AP-1 activation, luteolin acts to suppress the LPS-elicited inflammatory events in mouse alveolar macrophages, and this effect was mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species. Our observations suggest a possible therapeutic application of this agent for treating inflammatory disorders in lung.","publish_time":"2007-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chiu-Yuan; Peng, Wen-Huang; Tsai, Kuen-Daw; Hsu, Shih-Lan","journal":"Life Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ec065ac09b8dc596345ccc50fa12b9660651e91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094354.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320507007230; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320507007230","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Luteolin"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["luteolin acts","Abstract Luteolin","effects of luteolin","Luteolin dose","molecular mechanism of luteolin","suppression of LPS","LPS-activated macrophages","NF-\u03BAB","LPS-mediated protein kinase B","TNF-\u03B1","LPS-induced DNA binding activity of activating protein","induced TNF- \u03B1","mouse alveolar macrophages","nuclear translocation of NF","inflammatory genes","gene expression","inflammatory events","iNOS","inflammatory disorders","expression of inducible","COX","IL","DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B","generation of reactive oxygen species","\u03BAB p65 subunit","production of nitric oxide","mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S","peripheral macrophage RAW","tumor necrosis factor-alpha","Semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","agent","plant flavonoid","Akt","assay","IKK phosphorylation","mediators","possible therapeutic application","degradation of I\u03BAB","potent anti-inflammatory properties","cells","synthase","activation","prostaglandin E2","immune modulation","transcriptional level","observations","lung","cyclooxygenase","interleukin","lipopolysaccharide","PGE2","data","addition","sum","study"],"language":"en"},

Many countries are facing increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, which are, in their origin mostly attributed to regular international flight connections with China. This study aims to investigate this relation by analyzing available data on air traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 cases. Methods and findings: We analyzed available data on current domestic and international passenger volume and flight routes and compared these to the distribution of domestic and international COVID-19 cases. Results Our data indicate a strong linear correlation between domestic COVID-19 cases and passenger volume for regions within China (r2=0.92, p=0.19) and a significant correlation between international COVID-19 cases and passenger volume (r2=0.98, p\u003C0.01). Conclusions The number of flight routes as well as total passenger volume are highly relevant risk factors for the spread of current COVID-19. Multiple regions within Asia, as well as some in North America and Europe are at serious risk of constant exposure to COVID-19 from China and other highly infected countries. Risk for COVID-19 exposure remains relatively low in South America and Africa. If adequate measures are taken, including on-site disease detection and temporary passenger quarantine, limited but not terminated air traffic can be a feasible option to prevent a long-term crisis. Reasonable risk calculations and case evaluations per passenger volume are crucial aspects which must be considered when reducing international flights.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Ichii, Hirohito; Zacharksi, Maciej; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja","journal":"Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3affeb0d76f5e144a30e52a2b9b7a53a45d668f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220300864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32299783/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300864?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Asia","North America","Europe","South America","Africa"],"keyphrases":["international COVID","domestic COVID","international passenger volume","spread of COVID","cases","spread of current COVID","total passenger volume","increasing numbers of COVID","air traffic volume","China","international flights","temporary passenger quarantine","available data","regular international flight connections","relevant risk factors","serious risk of constant exposure","distribution of domestic","Reasonable risk calculations","number of flight routes","current outbreak","r2","significant correlation","South America","North America","Multiple regions","infected countries","strong linear correlation","case evaluations","on-site disease detection","feasible option","Europe","crucial aspects","Abstract Background","World Health Organization","novel coronavirus","long-term crisis","Africa","findings","Conclusions","origin","adequate measures","Asia","Methods","global pandemic","study"],"language":"en"},

The assay is based on the excellent electrical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Antibody\u2013virus complexes influence the conductance of underlying SWCNT thin film, which has been constructed by facile layer-by-layer self-assembly. The basic steps of conventional immunoassay are performed followed by the electric characterization of immunochips at the last stage. The resistance of immunochips tends to increase upon surface adsorption of macromolecules such as poly-l-lysine, anti-SIV antibodies, and SIVs during the assay. The resistance shift after the binding of SIV with anti-SIV antibody is normalized with the resistances of bare devices. The sensor selectivity tests are performed with non-SIVs, showing the normalized resistance shift of 12% as a background. The detection limit of 180 TCID(50)/ml of SIV is obtained suggesting a potential application of this assay as point-of-care detection or monitoring system.

We conducted quota sampling based on the proportion of the population in each province and gender ratios in the Sixth Census and obtained a sample size of 3837. Government intervention was divided into government communication, government prevention and control, and government rescue. We used multiple regression and a bootstrap mediation effect test to study the mechanism of these three forms of government intervention on the public\u0027s adoption of PARs. The results show that government prevention and control and government rescue significantly increased the likelihood of the public adopting PARs. Risk perception was significantly associated with the public\u0027s adoption of PARs. The effects of government interventions and risk perception on the public\u0027s adoption of PARs was not found to vary by region. Risk perception is identified as an important mediating factor between government intervention and the public\u0027s adoption of PARs.

An ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)(2) suggests that this group of viruses remains a major threat and that their distribution is wider than previously recognized. Although bats have been suggested as the natural reservoirs of both viruses(3\u20135), attempts to isolate the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV from bats have been unsuccessful. Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have now been reported from bats in China, Europe and Africa(5\u20138), but none are considered a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV because of their phylogenetic disparity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins (S) to use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule, the human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)(9,10). Here, we report whole genome sequences of two novel bat CoVs from Chinese horseshoe bats (Family: Rhinolophidae) in Yunnan, China; RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat CoVs, particularly in the receptor binding domain (RDB) of the S protein. Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat fecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses the ACE2s from human, civet and Chinese horseshoe bat for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness.","publish_time":"2013-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ge, Xing-Yi; Li, Jia-Lu; Yang, Xing-Lou; Chmura, Aleksei A.; Zhu, Guangjian; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Mazet, Jonna K.; Hu, Ben; Zhang, Wei; Peng, Cheng; Zhang, Yu-Ji; Luo, Chu-Ming; Tan, Bing; Wang, Ning; Zhu, Yan; Crameri, Gary; Zhang, Shu-Yi; Wang, Lin-Fa; Daszak, Peter; Shi, Zheng-Li","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18acb42cf96716cbb91dd26e491e253cc130cb78.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f9b9d389944a761f91d4162b8528143b447b298f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5389864.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24172901/; https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12711","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Europe","Africa","China"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","bat SL-CoVs","live SL-CoV","SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule","Diverse SARS","Chinese horseshoe bats","novel bat CoVs","identified bat CoVs","natural reservoirs of SARS","direct progenitor of SARS","progenitor virus of SARS","bat fecal samples","human angiotensin","WIV1","direct human infection","Rs3367","China","group of viruses","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","typical coronavirus morphology","ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pandemic preparedness","S protein","receptor binding domain","high-risk wildlife groups","emerging disease hotspots","Vero E6 cells","date","importance of pathogen discovery programs","Rhinolophidae","civet","Family","strongest evidence","significant public health events","recent history","strategy","RDB","inability","Yunnan","sequence identity","ACE2s","major threat","cell entry","phylogenetic disparity","distribution","enzyme","genome sequences","intermediate hosts","coronaviruses","spike proteins","recorded isolation","results","broad species tropism","RsSHC014","Europe","Africa","testing"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we analyzed the region of the APN gene that encodes a stretch of amino acid residues, essential for its HCoV-229E receptor function (amino acids 260\u2013353). Methods: Full-length APN exon 3, intron 3 and exon 4, was PCR-amplified and sequenced in DNA samples from 100 unrelated Caucasian Belgian healthy volunteers. Results: We identified seven polymorphisms, including four intron 3 and three exon 4 variations. Apart from the already known C956T exon 4 mutation, the six other polymorphisms have not yet been described. The most prevalent APN variations in this population (C956T leading to an alanine to valine substitution, G978T, G987A and intron3-C389T) always occurred together at an allele frequency of 8.5%. Haploid DNA sequencing demonstrated the presence of these four variations on the same allele. Three polymorphisms in intron 3, intron3-G395C, intron3-C86T, and intron3-C429T, were identified with an allele frequency of 3.5%, 1% and 0.5% respectively. Five haplotypes were identified in the population of 100 individuals.

There have been recent calls to incorporate building microbiology into occupant health and exposure research and standards, yet the built environment is largely viewed as a repository for microorganisms which are to be eliminated, instead of a habitat which is inexorably linked to the microbial influences of building inhabitants. Health sectors have re-evaluated the role of microorganisms in health, incorporating microorganisms into prevention and treatment protocols, yet no paradigm shift has occurred with respect to microbiology of the built environment, despite calls to do so. Technological and logistical constraints often preclude our ability to link health outcomes to indoor microbiology, yet sufficient study exists to inform the theory and implementation of the next era of research and intervention in the built environment.

From 2004, the Chinese National Influenza Center (CNIC) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USCDC) initiated Cooperative Agreements to build capacity in influenza surveillance in China. From 2004 to 2014, CNIC and USCDC collaborated on the following activities: 1) developing human technical expertise in virology and epidemiology in China; 2) developing a comprehensive influenza surveillance system by enhancing influenza-like illness (ILI) reporting and virological characterization; 3) strengthening analysis, utilization and dissemination of surveillance data; and 4) improving early response to influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Since 2004, CNIC expanded its national influenza surveillance and response system which, as of 2014, included 408 laboratories and 554 sentinel hospitals. With support from USCDC, more than 2500 public health staff from China received virology and epidemiology training, enabling \u003E 98% network laboratories to establish virus isolation and/or nucleic acid detection techniques. CNIC established viral drug resistance surveillance and platforms for gene sequencing, reverse genetics, serologic detection, and vaccine strains development. CNIC also built a bioinformatics platform to strengthen data analysis and utilization, publishing weekly on-line influenza surveillance reports in English and Chinese. The surveillance system collects 200,000\u2013400,000 specimens and tests more than 20,000 influenza viruses annually, which provides valuable information for World Health Organization (WHO) influenza vaccine strain recommendations. In 2010, CNIC became the sixth WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza. CNIC has strengthened virus and data sharing, and has provided training and reagents for other countries to improve global capacity for influenza control and prevention.

Therefore, we monitored patients admitted with respiratory infections (RI) in 9 Berlin hospitals from 7.12.2009 to 12.12.2010 according to different case definitions (CD) and determined the proportion of cases with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1). We compared the sensitivity and specificity of CD for capturing pandemic pH1N1 cases. METHODS: We established an RI-surveillance restricted to adults aged \u2264 65 years within the framework of a pH1N1 vaccine effectiveness study, which required active identification of RI-cases. The hospital information-system was screened daily for newly admitted RI-patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from consenting patients were tested by PCR for influenza-virus subtypes. Four clinical CD were compared in terms of capturing pH1N1-positives among hospitalized RI-patients by applying sensitivity and specificity analyses. The broadest case definition (CD1) was used for inclusion of RI-cases; the narrowest case definition (CD4) was identical to the SARI case definition recommended by ECDC/WHO. RESULTS: Over the study period, we identified 1,025 RI-cases, of which 283 (28%) met the ECDC/WHO SARI case definition. The percentage of SARI-cases among internal medicine admissions decreased from 3.2% (calendar-week 50-2009) to 0.2% (week 25-2010). Of 354 patients tested by PCR, 20 (6%) were pH1N1-positive. Two case definitions narrower than CD1 but -in contrast to SARI- not requiring shortness of breath yielded the largest areas under the Receiver-Operator-Curve. Heterogeneity of proportions of patients admitted with RI between hospitals was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive surveillance of RI cases was feasible in a network of community hospitals. In most settings, several hospitals should be included to ensure representativeness. Although misclassification resulting from failure to obtain symptoms in the hospital information-system cannot be ruled out, a high proportion of hospitalized PCR-positive pH1N1-patients (45%) did not fulfil the SARI case-definition that included shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Thus, to assess influenza-related disease burden in hospitals, broader, alternative case definitions should be considered.","publish_time":"2012-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nachtnebel, Matthias; Greutelaers, Benedikt; Falkenhorst, Gerhard; Jorgensen, Pernille; Dehnert, Manuel; Schweiger, Brunhilde; Tr\u00E4der, Christian; Buda, Silke; Eckmanns, Tim; Wichmann, Ole; Hellenbrand, Wiebke","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72e9038e9738f001e0b050d11f9b05a6376919bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3362781.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22452874/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","SARI","ECDC","RI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RI-cases","SARI case definition","SARI case-definition","admitted RI-patients","hospitalized RI-patients","RI-surveillance","Comprehensive surveillance of RI cases","inclusion of RI","proportion of cases","pandemic pH1N1 cases","narrowest case definition","broadest case definition","burden of severe influenza-cases","alternative case definitions","consenting patients","case definitions narrower","different case definitions","active identification of RI","percentage of SARI","sentinel hospitals","pH1N1-positives","Berlin hospitals","high proportion of hospitalized PCR-positive pH1N1-patients","network of community hospitals","pH1N1 vaccine effectiveness study","specificity of CD","Surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections","shortness of breath","CD1","influenza-related disease burden","influenza-virus subtypes","sensitivity","clinical CD","hospital information-system","ECDC","study period","specificity analyses","calendar-week","largest areas","symptoms","framework","CD4","internal medicine admissions","Receiver-Operator","BACKGROUND","terms","contrast","CONCLUSIONS","failure","difficulty breathing","years","Nasopharyngeal swabs","adults","pdm09","Heterogeneity of proportions","Curve","misclassification","RESULTS","settings","representativeness","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The case study finds that decommissioned industrial sites had characteristics that made them attractive when central and local governments started to promote creative industries, but, with development of urban art districts, the impact of avant-garde artists on the direction of development was reduced, and developers, high profile galleries and multinational corporations had an increasing influence. The results of our study indicate that the literature on intra-metropolitan location and change, and the evolution of industrial districts should pay more attention to the reuse of the decommissioned industrial land and sites for industrial restructuring, and particularly to the role of multi-scalar factors in reshaping the geography of cities.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Yimei; Liu, Zhigao; Dunford, Michael; Liu, Weidong","journal":"Habitat International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc91a0ef5ca1dd3052bf81640e99764ffef19e2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124207.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287703/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2014.11.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197397514002045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397514002045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["industrial restructuring","decommissioned industrial sites","industrial city","decommissioned industrial land","previous industrial sites","evolution of industrial districts","development of urban art districts","creative industry districts","art markets","rise of service","creative industries-oriented global metropolis","Chinese cities","transformation of Beijing","trans-local factors","decentralization of manufacturing industries","transforming Beijing","local governments","urban centres","direction of development","geography of cities","case study","spatial transformation","land use policies","interconnections of global forces","Chinese system of governance","role of multi-scalar factors","market relationships","state","multinational corporations","change","impact of avant-garde artists","economic reforms","high profile galleries","literature","developers","characteristics","intra-metropolitan location","reuse","attention","increasing influence","Abstract","article","results"],"language":"en"},

Ever since, naturally evolved strains used for vaccination were introduced into research laboratories where VACV and other poxviruses with improved safety profiles were generated. Recombinant DNA technology along with the DNA genome features of this virus family allowed the generation of vaccines against heterologous diseases, and the specific insertion and deletion of poxvirus genes generated an even broader spectrum of modified viruses with new properties that increase their immunogenicity and safety profile as vaccine vectors.

The objective of the present study was to determine the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in dairy, beef and crossbred white veal production. A total of 5853 calves, housed in 15 production cohorts, were followed during one production cycle. Causes of mortality were determined by necropsy. Morbidity was daily recorded by the producers. RESULTS: The total mortality risk was 5,3% and was significantly higher in beef veal production compared to dairy or crossbreds. The main causes of mortality were pneumonia (1.3% of the calves at risk), ruminal disorders (0.7%), idiopathic peritonitis (0.5%), enterotoxaemia (0.5%) and enteritis (0.4%). Belgian Blue beef calves were more likely to die from pneumonia, enterotoxaemia and arthritis. Detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus at necropsy was associated with chronic pneumonia and pleuritis. Of the calves, 25.4% was treated individually and the morbidity rate was 1.66 cases per 1000 calf days at risk. The incidence rate of respiratory disease, diarrhea, arthritis and otitis was 0.95, 0.30, 0.11 and 0.07 cases per 1000 calf days at risk respectively. Morbidity peaked in the first three weeks after arrival and gradually declined towards the end of the production cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided insights into the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in white veal calves in Belgium, housed in the most frequent housing system in Europe. The necropsy findings, identified risk periods and differences between production systems can guide both veterinarians and producers towards the most profitable and ethical preventive and therapeutic protocols.","publish_time":"2012-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pardon, Bart; De Bleecker, Koen; Hostens, Miel; Callens, Jozefien; Dewulf, Jeroen; Deprez, Piet","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86f450394e3530589eed829b5114c96d87513528.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3366893.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-26; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22414223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Belgium","Europe"],"keyphrases":["beef veal production","total mortality risk","white veal calves","epidemiology of morbidity","morbidity rate","production cycle","main causes of mortality","crossbred white veal production","production systems","production cohorts","risk periods","white veal industry","Belgian Blue beef calves","dairy","cases","necropsy findings","present study","chronic pneumonia","calf days","arthritis","producers","enterotoxaemia","incidence rate of respiratory disease","Detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus","high levels of antimicrobial drug use","differences","insights","Belgium","ethical preventive","therapeutic protocols","resistance","veterinarians","frequent housing system","ruminal disorders","Europe","CONCLUSIONS","otitis","end","crossbreds","RESULTS","arrival","idiopathic peritonitis","pleuritis","objective","weeks","BACKGROUND","enteritis"],"language":"en"},

Twenty fecal samples (10/pack) were collected using a sampling protocol, based on the combining data from radio-collared wolves with geographic information system (GIS) analysis, allowing to mark off the home range of packs and to recover group-specific and high-quality specimens. Virological screening against the most prevalent canine viruses (protoparvovirus, distemper virus, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses) was carried out by molecular methods, while parasites were detected by means of copromicroscopic and molecular analysis. Canine parvovirus type 2b (CPV-2b) is the most prevalent virus in both packs (7/20), followed by canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2), while no sequences of canine distemper virus and coronaviruses were detected. The sequence analysis of the viruses demonstrated the domestic origin of the infection, highlighting the importance of vaccination of local dogs in order to reduce the risk of exposure of wildlife to these pathogens. Fourteen samples resulted positive for parasites. Capillaria aerophila (sin. Eucoleus aerophilus), Ancylostoma/Uncinaria, Trichuris vulpis eggs, Sarcocystis spp., Cystoisospora canis, and Angiostrongylus vasorum larvae were identified. Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (ovine genotype G1) and Giardia duodenalis(canid-specific Assemblage C) were also characterized, providing insights into the wolves\u2019 diet and their effects on environmental contamination.

Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the developed vaccine were evaluated in vivo. Five 10-week-old beagle pups were administered (three weeks apart) two vaccine doses, whereas two animals served as unvaccinated controls.

Serum antibodies against CCoV were detected in vaccinates starting from study day 14 (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or 28 (by virus neutralisation test). Subsequent challenge with virulent CCoV-IIb resulted in the development of mild gastroenteric disease in control pups, whereas vaccinates did not display clinical signs. Faecal shedding of the challenge virus occurred in both treatment groups, but vaccinated dogs were found to shed very low viral titres in comparison to controls.

As the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19) outbreak spreads [2], ICUs outside of China need to prepare for a potential surge of critically ill patients and counter the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 [3]. Liu et al. have described their important preparations [4], and we would like to expand on their good advice by sharing lessons learnt from our early experience. By 17 February 2020, Singapore recorded the highest number of confirmed cases outside of mainland China with several clusters of local transmission. All healthcare institutions adopted a common strategy of containment, with isolation of all suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in negative-pressure rooms. We were fortunate that most ICU beds were single rooms\u2014this infrastructure was put in place following the outbreak of SARS in 2003. We realized preparing ICUs for patients with COVID-19 had numerous other requirements. First, infection control not only involved strict adherence to personal protective equipment for the individual, but also involved changes in group dynamics. We organized our ICU to mitigate the effects of any infected staff by avoiding potential spread between teams (see Table 1). Related to infection control, the medical ICU was given the task to cohort suspect or confirmed cases, including with peri- and post-partum care of pregnant women. Second, evolving information necessitated rapid and regular communications with large, disparate groups of clinicians.AU - Siow, Wen Ting","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liew, Mei Fong; Siow, Wen Ting; MacLaren, Graeme; See, Kay Choong","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7063757.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32151274/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-2814-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Liu","Wen Ting"],"organizations":["ICU","SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["confirmed cases of COVID","ill patients","ICU beds","medical ICU","SARS-CoV","outbreak of SARS","highest number of confirmed cases","infection control","ICUs","high transmissibility of SARS","coronavirus disease","mainland China","single rooms","potential surge","outbreak spreads","infected staff","intensive care unit","negative-pressure rooms","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","post-partum care of pregnant women","regular communications","strict adherence","isolation","task","disparate groups of","common strategy of containment","personal protective equipment","cohort suspect","lessons","Siow","evolving information","infrastructure","admission","clusters of local transmission","healthcare institutions","individual","teams","Singapore","place","effects","Wen Ting","Liu","important preparations","good advice","early experience","Table","requirements","group dynamics"],"language":"en"},

This new epidemic caused a great mental reaction among the public. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above. The respondents were grouped as \u2018affected group\u2019 and \u2018unaffected group\u2019 on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined. RESULTS: Among 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%). Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS. People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. The government should focus more on providing economic and medical support to improve the general population\u2019s mental state.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Lei; Huang, Xiaoming; Zhang, Shuai; Yang, Jinrong; Yang, Lin; Xu, Min","journal":"Med Sci Monit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a951528463db929518218391533313cb2931469a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199435.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.924609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335579/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAS","SDS"],"locations":["China","Chongqing"],"keyphrases":["unaffected group","higher SAS","prevalence of anxiety","higher scores","self-rating anxiety scale","self-rating depression scale","COVID","outbreak","higher self-evaluated level of knowledge","SDS scores","southwestern China","associated factors of anxiety","lower self-perceived health condition","lower education level","public","respondents","Lower average household income","psychological support","medical support","great mental reaction","general population\u2019s mental state","greater property damage","Chongqing","families","new epidemic","Data","Wuhan","quarantine","colleagues","classmates","neighbors","Hubei","participants","People","basis","Yunnan Province","MATERIAL","METHODS","end","CONCLUSIONS","country","month","BACKGROUND","government","RESULTS","years","study"],"language":"en"},

In addition, EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression and c\u2010Src/EGFR phosphorylation were both attenuated by transfection with c\u2010Src siRNA or pretreatment with the inhibitors of c\u2010Src (PP1) or EGF receptor (EGFR) (AG1478 and EGFR\u2010neutralizing antibody). We also observed that EV71\u2010induced p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation was decreased following pretreatment with AG1478. Moreover, EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression was blocked by pretreatment with the p300 inhibitor GR343 or by transfection with p300 siRNA. Using immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we observed that EV71 stimulated the association of CREB and p300 with the COX\u20102 promoter region. Notably, we also demonstrated that EV71\u2010induced COX\u20102 expression and PGE(2) production promoted viral replication via cAMP signaling. In summary, this study demonstrates that EV71 activates the c\u2010Src/EGFR/p42/p44 MAPK pathway in human SK\u2010N\u2010SH cell, which leads to the activation of CREB/p300, and stimulates COX\u20102 expression and PGE(2) release.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To identify respiratory pathogens in the induced sputum (IS) of elderly asthmatics, and to determine the association between pathogens and the markers of asthma activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine subjects with stable asthma, 15 above 65 years of age and 14 aged 30-49 years, underwent clinical evaluation, fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement, and sputum induction. Pathogens were detected by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The periostin concentration of IS supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum eosinophil cationic protein and total IgE levels were measured by ImmunoCAP. RESULTS: Elderly patients, as compared to non-elderly, had significantly higher eosinophilia in IS, although other markers of eosinophilic inflammation were comparable. Half of the subjects were positive for Haemophilus influenzae. Chlamydophila pneumoniae was found in two subjects. Respiratory viruses were detected in more than 70% of patients. The detection rates and profiles of atypical bacteria and respiratory viruses were similar in both groups. Only in the elderly asthmatics was influenza A positivity associated with lower predicted FVC%, RSV A positivity connected with decreased tIgE concentration, and RSV B positivity related to a lower percentage of lymphocytes in IS. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the existence of differences in some clinical and inflammatory characteristics of asthma between elderly and non-elderly asthmatics, the pathogen detection rates in the IS from the two groups are similar.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"WARDZY\u0143SKA, ALEKSANDRA; PAWE\u0141CZYK, MA\u0141GORZATA; G\u0141OBI\u0143SKA, ANNA; MAKOWSKA, JOANNA S.; KOWALSKI, MAREK L.","journal":"Cent Eur J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cfe567d42fa459cb4364e240ddfe29629d03f85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7050048.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5114/ceji.2019.92790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32140050/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chlamydophila"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Elderly patients","non-elderly asthmatics","Respiratory pathogens","subjects","Respiratory viruses","stable asthma","exacerbations of asthma","markers of asthma activity","RSV B positivity","inflammatory characteristics of asthma","groups","pathogen detection rates","clinical evaluation","sputum induction","induced sputum","years of age","periostin concentration","lower predicted FVC","decreased tIgE concentration","lower percentage of lymphocytes","markers of eosinophilic inflammation","fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement","total IgE levels","profiles of atypical bacteria","Serum eosinophil cationic protein","CONCLUSIONS","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","supernatants","existence of differences","METHODS","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","higher eosinophilia","ImmunoCAP","Haemophilus influenzae","STUDY","association","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","Half","MATERIAL","pathogenesis","ages","airway microbiome","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","AIM"],"language":"en"},

We postulate that these two interleukins may participate in the early phase of TBE and NB. The aim of the study was to measure serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of ICAM-1, IL-21 and IL-23 in patients with TBE and NB before treatment and to assess their usefulness in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory process in TBE and NB. Methods Forty-three patients hospitalized in The Department of Infectious Diseases and Neuroinfections of Medical University in Bialystok, Poland, were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups: TBE, NB and CG. Pre-treatment blood and CSF samples were obtained from all patients. ELISA kits (DRG Instruments, Germany) were used to measure the concentration of IL-21, IL-23 and sICAM-1. Results Significant differences between TBE/CG and NB/CG concentration of sICAM-1 were found only in the CSF. CSF IL-21 levels in NB were lower than in TBE. In TBE, a strong negative correlation between CSF concentration of IL-21 and IL-23 and monocyte count in CSF was observed. Negative correlation between IL-21 in CSF and neutrophil count was also noted. Serum IL-23 correlated positively with leukocytes and platelet count in serum. In NB, a strong positive correlation between serum IL-21 and platelet count and negative correlation between IL-21 in serum and CSF with pleocytosis was observed. Conclusions Increased sICAM-1 concentration in TBE and NB may be a proof of brain\u2013blood barrier disturbances in the early phase of these diseases.

If this occurs, critical care triage, which includes both prioritizing patients for care and rationing scarce resources, will be required. The suggestions in this chapter are important for all who are involved in large-scale pandemics or disasters with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials. METHODS The Triage topic panel reviewed previous task force suggestions and the literature to identify 17 key questions for which specific literature searches were then conducted to identify studies upon which evidence-based recommendations could be made. No studies of sufficient quality were identified. Therefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process. Suggestions from the previous task force that were not being updated were also included for validation by the expert panel. RESULTS The suggestions from the task force outline the key principles upon which critical care triage should be based as well as a path for the development of the plans, processes, and infrastructure required. This article provides 11 suggestions regarding the principles upon which critical care triage should be based and policies to guide critical care triage. CONCLUSIONS Ethical and efficient critical care triage is a complex process that requires significant planning and preparation. At present, the prognostic tools required to produce an effective decision support system (triage protocol) as well as the infrastructure, processes, legal protections, and training are largely lacking in most jurisdictions. Therefore, critical care triage should be a last resort after mass critical care surge strategies.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Christian, Michael D.; Sprung, Charles L.; King, Mary A.; Dichter, Jeffrey R.; Kissoon, Niranjan; Devereaux, Asha V.; Gomersall, Charles D.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5220bf28ca929f5bd44c5a9eac988ceab4cba9bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127536.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.14-0736; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215519909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144591/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215519909","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Pandemics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficient critical care triage","triage protocol","Triage topic panel","mass critical care surge strategies","previous task force suggestions","expert opinion-based suggestions","injured patients","expert panel","key principles","prioritizing patients","disasters","processes","infrastructure","evidence-based recommendations","surge-response strategies","complex process","key questions","available resources","scarce resources","large-scale pandemics","BACKGROUND Pandemics","modified Delphi process","specific literature searches","studies of sufficient quality","resort","hospital administrators","front-line clinicians","effective decision support system","public health","large numbers","CONCLUSIONS Ethical","policies","training","significant planning","plans","legal protections","METHODS","prognostic tools","government officials","development","preparation","present","path","chapter","validation","article","jurisdictions"],"language":"en"},

Few data are available that quantify feed and water consumption, as well as growth, in healthy versus non-healthy calves\u2014the objective of this study. A database of Holstein calves (\u003C1 wk of age; n = 313) was developed to compare calves that developed diarrhea in the first 21 d after arrival from commercial farms to the research facility versus calves that remained healthy. Individual calf data from 4 experiments included daily intake of milk replacer, free water, electrolyte solution, and starter grain, as well as weekly body weight (BW) and frame measures for 21 d after arrival. Calves with a fecal score of \u003E2 for \u22653 consecutive days over the first 21 d of each experiment were retrospectively classified as diarrheic (DIA; n = 96); the remainder were classified as healthy (HEA; n = 217). Other health issues were minimal. The likelihood of elevated fecal score occurrence and the cumulative number of days with an elevated score were greater for DIA calves than for HEA calves. The initial total protein concentration in blood did not differ between classifications. Cumulative milk replacer dry matter intake (DMI) and water consumed from milk replacer were significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves, because DIA calves were more likely to refuse milk replacer. Cumulative starter DMI was decreased for DIA versus HEA calves. As a result, cumulative total DMI was significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves. Cumulative free water intake did not differ between classifications. The DIA calves were more likely to receive electrolyte solution and have more days given electrolyte solution than HEA calves. As a result, total cumulative intake of electrolyte solution was greater in DIA calves than in HEA calves. Cumulative total water intake did not differ between classifications. Initial BW did not differ between classifications; however, a classification \u00D7 time interaction for BW indicated that HEA calves were heavier than DIA calves and had greater ADG. Significant classification \u00D7 time interactions for hip height and heart girth revealed that HEA calves had a larger frame size. Gain\u2013feed ratios for both milk replacer intake and total DMI differed between classifications: DIA calves were less feed-efficient than HEA calves. In conclusion, diarrhea in young calves decreases DMI, BW gain, and feed efficiency relative to HEA calves within 21 d of arrival.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morrison, S.

To understand the effect of SADS-CoV on host cells, we characterized the apoptotic pathways and elucidated mechanisms underlying the process of apoptotic cell death after SADS-CoV infection. SADS-CoV-infected cells showed evidence of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis and reduction in SADS-CoV replication, suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway. Furthermore, SADS-CoV infection activated the initiators caspase-8 and -9 and upregulated FasL and Bid cleavage, demonstrating a crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. However, the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Cytochrome c (Cyt c) relocalized to the mitochondria and cytoplasm, respectively, after infection by SADS-CoV. Moreover, Vero E6 and IPI-2I cells treated with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, were completely protected from SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis and viral replication, suggesting the involvement of cyclophilin D (CypD) in these processes. Altogether, our results indicate that caspase-dependent FasL (extrinsic)- and mitochondria (intrinsic)- mediated apoptotic pathways play a central role in SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis that facilitates viral replication. In summary, these findings demonstrate mechanisms by which SADS-CoV induces apoptosis and improve our understanding of SADS-CoV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jiyu; Han, Yuru; Shi, Hongyan; Chen, Jianfei; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Xiaobo; Zhou, Ling; Liu, Jianbo; Zhang, Jialin; Ji, Zhaoyang; Jing, Zhaoyang; Ma, Jingyun; Shi, Da; Feng, Li","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89054d3b5ef141d48c496a326098d412b3f0c462.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7054944.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32090691/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1722758","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SADS-CoV replication","SADS-CoV infection","CoV-induced apoptosis","CoV pathogenesis","inhibition of SADS","understanding of SADS","effect of SADS","apoptotic pathways","evidence of apoptosis","caspase-dependent FasL","viral replication","intrinsic pathways","initiators caspase","pan-caspase inhibitor","caspase-dependent pathway","host cells","infected cells","process of apoptotic cell death","Cytochrome c","Cyt c","elucidated mechanisms","upregulated FasL","Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus","severe clinical diarrhea","discovered enteric coronavirus","inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore","aetiological agent","intestinal pathological damage","association","reduction","central role","proapoptotic proteins Bax","crosstalk","involvement of cyclophilin D","CypD","MPTP","Bid cleavage","piglets","CsA","IPI","use","results","findings","Vero E6","processes","summary","cyclosporin","cytoplasm"],"language":"en"},

However, atomic details at the binding interface demonstrate that key residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2-CTD slightly strengthen the interaction and lead to higher affinity for receptor binding than SARS-RBD. Additionally, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against SARS-CoV-S1/receptor-binding domain (RBD) were unable to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating notable differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

We adopt the evolution principle and then propose a very simple and intuitive new model for network growth, which naturally evolves modular networks with multiple communities. The number and size of the communities evolve over time and are primarily subjected to a single free parameter. Surprisingly, under some circumstances, our framework can construct a tree-like network with clear community structures\u2014branches and leaves of a tree.

Since Chinese rhesus (rh) macaques do not usually develop SARS after SARS-CoV infection, it has been suggested that rh-ACE2 probably does not support viral entry efficiently. To determine the role of rh-ACE2 in early lung pathogenesis in vivo, we studied eleven Chinese rhesus monkeys experimentally infected with a pathogenic SARS-CoVPUMC01 strain. Rh-ACE2 genes were amplified from all animals by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and their function was studied in vitro using a pseudovirus entry assay. Many natural non-synonymous (NS) changes were found in rh-ACE2 genes. Compared to human (hu) ACE2, thirty-eight consensus NS changes were found in rh-ACE2. Since these changes do not interact with the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV, rh-ACE2 in general is as effective as human homolog in supporting viral entry. Rh-ACE2, however, is more polymorphic than hu-ACE2. Additional sporadic NS substitutions in clone Rh11-7 reduced the level of rh-ACE2 protein expression and did not support viral entry effectively. Further mutagenesis analysis showed that a natural mutation Y217N dramatically alters ACE2 expression and entry efficiency. Moreover, introduction of the Y217N mutation into hu-ACE2 caused the down-regulation of expression and reduced viral entry efficiency. These results indicate that the Y217N mutation plays a role in modulating SARS-CoV infection. Our results provide insights for understanding the role of rh-ACE2 in SARS lung pathogenesis in a non-human primate model.","publish_time":"2008-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yunxin; Liu, Li; Wei, Qiang; Zhu, Hua; Jiang, Hong; Tu, Xinming; Qin, Chuan; Chen, Zhiwei","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8db4cb61bdb269eefdb3220e7f4b6e710c5c547.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103406.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18801550/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.08.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208005230; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208005230","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Rh-ACE2 genes","ACE2 expression","hu-ACE2","role of rh","ACE2 protein expression","SARS pathogenesis","level of rh","SARS lung pathogenesis","viral entry efficiency","modulating SARS-CoV infection","receptor binding domain of SARS","Y217N mutation","target cell entry","pseudovirus entry assay","pathogenic SARS-CoVPUMC01 strain","natural mutation Y217N","important role","consensus NS changes","early lung pathogenesis","regulation of expression","human homolog","results","non-human primate model","Chinese rhesus monkeys","Additional sporadic NS substitutions","animals","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","clone Rh11","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","general","function","macaques","mutagenesis analysis","Abstract Angiotensin","enzyme","introduction","insights"],"language":"en"},

The model describes the spatio-temporal spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and aims to capture dynamics also based on human habits and geographical features. To test the model, we compare the outputs generated by a finite-element solver with measured data over the Italian region of Lombardy, which has been heavily impacted by this crisis between February and April 2020. Our results show a strong qualitative agreement between the simulated forecast of the spatio-temporal COVID-19 spread in Lombardy and epidemiological data collected at the municipality level. Additional simulations exploring alternative scenarios for the relaxation of lockdown restrictions suggest that reopening strategies should account for local population densities and the specific dynamics of the contagion. Thus, we argue that data-driven simulations of our model could ultimately inform health authorities to design effective pandemic-arresting measures and anticipate the geographical allocation of crucial medical resources.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viguerie, Alex; Lorenzo, Guillermo; Auricchio, Ferdinando; Baroli, Davide; Hughes, Thomas J.R.; Patton, Alessia; Reali, Alessandro; Yankeelov, Thomas E.; Veneziani, Alessandro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c20969be78ed452a637c618c307a437b91e27615.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05320v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["mathematical model","heterogeneous diffusion model","measured data","epidemiological data","spatio-temporal spread","spatio-temporal COVID","data-driven simulations","specific dynamics","geographical features","Additional simulations","Italian region of Lombardy","effective pandemic-arresting measures","geographical allocation of crucial medical resources","simulated forecast","partial differential equations","reopening strategies","relaxation of lockdown restrictions","local population densities","alternative scenarios","strong qualitative agreement","finite-element solver","SEIRD","health authorities","human habits","Deceased","results","municipality level","outputs","early version","contagion","crisis"],"language":"en"},

We estimate the value of disease avoidance using an epidemiological model that projects the spread of COVID-19 across rich and poor countries. Social distancing measures that\u0022flatten the curve\u0022of the disease to bring demand within the capacity of healthcare systems are predicted to save many lives in high-income countries, such that practically any economic cost is worth bearing. These social distancing policies are estimated to be less effective in poor countries with younger populations less susceptible to COVID-19, and more limited healthcare systems, which were overwhelmed before the pandemic. Moreover, social distancing lowers disease risk by limiting people\u0027s economic opportunities. Poorer people are less willing to make those economic sacrifices. They place relatively greater value on their livelihood concerns compared to contracting COVID-19. Not only are the epidemiological and economic benefits of social distancing much smaller in poorer countries, such policies may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the informal sector lack the resources and social protections to isolate themselves and sacrifice economic opportunities until the virus passes. By limiting their ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger, deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity. Rather than a blanket adoption of social distancing measures, we advocate for the exploration of alternative harm-reduction strategies, including universal mask adoption and increased hygiene measures.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnett-Howell, Zachary; Mobarak, Ahmed Mushfiq","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d965a34b58313fdd0ea5a801d5838893b270625.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04867v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","North America"],"keyphrases":["social distancing policies","economic benefits of social distancing","social protections","blanket adoption of social distancing measures","social distancing lowers disease risk","poor countries","poorer countries","economic cost","economic sacrifices","people\u0027s economic opportunities","spread of COVID","contracting COVID","high-income countries","value of disease avoidance","pandemic","increased hygiene measures","capacity of healthcare systems","limited healthcare systems","epidemiological model","greater value","Poorer people","universal mask adoption","younger populations","exploration of alternative harm-reduction strategies","deprivation","livelihood concerns","primary policy prescription","informal sector","related mortality","hunger","resources","demand","heavy toll","morbidity","lives","living","curve","Europe","North America","Workers","ability","virus"],"language":"en"},

Here, we use population size for pathogen transmission to measure the intensity of public health interventions, which is a key characteristic variable for nowcasting and forecasting of the epidemic. By formulating a hidden Markov dynamic system and using nonlinear filtering theory, we have developed a stochastic epidemic dynamic model under public health interventions. The model parameters and states are estimated in time from internationally available public data by combining an unscented filter and an interacting multiple model filter. Moreover, we consider the computability of the population size and provide its selection criterion.

The present paper is aimed to ponder whether it is realistic and worth to try and further amend classical models of genetic effects or it proves more sensible to undertake alternative theoretical strategies instead. In order to further feed into that debate, mathematical developments for gene-environment interaction stemming from the classical models of genetic effects are here revised and brought up-to-date with the prospects present-day available data bestow, particularly in the context of precision medicine. Those developments strengthen the methodology required to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u0027Alvarez-Castro, Jos\u0027e M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01628v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classical models of genetic effects","Genetic mapping","mathematical developments","development of statistical procedures","gene-environment interaction","different stages","additional parameters","debate","implied limitations","medical interpretations","prospects present-day available data","molecular biology techniques","analyses","purposes","century","feed","alternative theoretical strategies","decade","loci","context of precision medicine","COVID","order","methodology","present paper","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

We present here an analysis of an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model, that takes into account the presence of aymptomatic carriers, and explore the effects of different intervention strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number ($R_0\u003E1$) to a target value ($R_0^{\\rm target}\u003C1 $), but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same target value, $R_0^{\\rm target}\u003C1 $, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than lockdowns that only implement SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has has to be based on contact tracing and the ratio of tests/per day to the number of new cases/per day has to be scaled with the mean number of contacts that an infectious person has, which would be high in regions with high population density and low levels of social distancing. We point out that, apart from $R_0$, an important quantity is the largest eigenvalue of the linearized dynamics which provides a more complete understanding of the disease progression both pre- and post- intervention and explains observed data. Weak extended intervention strategies (that reduce $R_0$ but not to a value less than $1$) can reduce the peak values of infections and the asymptotic affected population. We provide simple expressions for these in terms of the disease parameters and apply them in the Indian context to obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic. Looking at real data, we find that for many countries, several broad qualitative features are captured well by the model.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Das, Arghya; Dhar, Abhishek; Goyal, Srashti; Kundu, Anupam","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91016dd39a86a7bc5e4b257e69dae6ad063a37d4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11511v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TQ","target value","post- intervention","Weak extended intervention strategies","pandemic","rm target","effects of different intervention strategies","disease reproductive number","disease progression","day","SD","disease parameters","model equations","high population density","number of new cases","asymptotic affected population","mean number of contacts","low levels of social distancing","observed data","real data","largest eigenvalue","complete understanding","regions","linearized dynamics","heuristic projections","ratio of tests","peak values of infections","terms","account","infectious person","testing-quarantining","evolution","Covid","presence of aymptomatic carriers","Indian context","important quantity","broad qualitative features","world","countries","contact tracing","course","Modeling","challenging problem","simple expressions","analysis","lockdowns","SEIR","distinct ways","country"],"language":"en"},

Governments around the world have undertaken varying degrees of public safety measures, including recommendations and ad campaigns for improved hygiene practices, enacting social distancing requirements and limiting large public gatherings, and stay-at-home orders and lockdowns. In the United States, while the response has varied greatly from state to state, we clearly see that the effect of these public safety measures is significant and, if these measures continue to remain in effect, or are expanded to a nationwide lockdown, the pandemic can be controlled and the disease likely overcome with mitigated consequences. In this paper, we model the spread of the novel coronavirus using a causal model.

The size and number of vortices in the corner area are significantly reduced, because the increase in Reynolds number makes the influx impact stronger. It can be seen from the Reynolds stress distribution which is obviously different in different turning sections that the pulsation caused by the mixing of the main flow and the vortex is obviously stronger than that at the boundary.

One of the main sources of difficulty is that a very limited amount of daily COVID-19 case data is available, and with few exceptions, the majority of countries are currently in the\u0022exponential spread stage,\u0022and thus there is scarce information available which would enable one to predict the phase transition between spread and containment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predicting the spread of COVID-19 based on dictionary learning and online nonnegative matrix factorization (online NMF). The key idea is to learn dictionary patterns of short evolution instances of the new daily cases in multiple countries at the same time, so that their latent correlation structures are captured in the dictionary patterns. We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from the entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online NMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions, we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results can be directly attributed to the learned dictionary patterns due to their interpretability.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lyu, Hanbaek; Strohmeier, Christopher; Menz, Georg; Needell, Deanna","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8df55596099e56ce2990629dac96129e4080a0c5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09112v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["learned dictionary patterns","dictionary learning","spread of COVID","dictionary patterns of short evolution instances","daily COVID","containment of COVID","online NMF","one-step predictions","entire time-series","exponential spread stage","minibatch learning","multiple countries","majority of countries","new daily cases","scarce information available","nonnegative matrix factorization","challenge of utmost importance","broader scientific community","case data","latent correlation structures","novel approach","recent observations","exceptions","partial fitting","phase transition","key idea","interpretability","main sources of difficulty","paper","near future","prediction results"],"language":"en"},

However, the recent COVID pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and re-use procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects. This charge degrades quickly when the mask is used. Moreover, simple decontamination procedures (e.g. use of alcohol) immediately degrade any remaining charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration efficiency post decontamination. In this brief report, we summarize preliminary results on the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and filtration efficiency in N95 masks. We show how the charge on the mask changes due to decontamination treatments, and correlate with reduced filtration efficiency. Additionally, we propose and show that it is possible to recharge the masks post-decontamination treatment and recover filtration efficiency. Importantly, recharging can be performed using readily available equipment and materials, and so can be employed both in urban and rural settings. We emphasize that because of the current worldwide lockdown, the measurements reported in this report are preliminary, performed with hastily constructed home-built equipment on a small variety of masks available to us. Although we are confident in our results, we encourage groups with special-purpose equipment to redo and verify our experiments.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hossain, Emroj; Bhadra, Satyanu; Jain, Harsh; Bhattacharya, Arnab; Ghosh, Shankar; Levine, Dov","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6feca73b5021bb38dd35f4acd1b435992c23d059.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13641v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["filtration efficiency of N95 masks","filtration efficiency post decontamination","reduced filtration efficiency","masks post-decontamination treatment","decontamination treatments","available equipment","simple decontamination procedures","measurement of charge","small variety of masks available","remaining charge","personal protective equipment","special-purpose equipment","preliminary results","re-use procedures","worldwide effort","mask changes","brief report","polypropylene electret fibers","simple laboratory setup","current worldwide lockdown","particles","intermediate layer","measurements","development","presence","frontline health-care workers","groups","alcohol","serious shortage","constructed home","recent COVID pandemic","electrophoretic effects","major factor","rural settings","materials","one-time usage","recharging","experiments"],"language":"en"},

In this regard, it is possible to obtain the evolution for the number of infectious significantly close to that provided by current data. Accordingly, we evaluate possible future scenarios for the disease spread. Regarding the population susceptibility, we consider different social behaviors in response to quarantine measures and precautions to avoid contagion. We conclude that the future scenario of the epidemic depends significantly on the social behavior adopted to date, as well as on the contagion control measures.

However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number for populations with local person-to-person transmission and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases (since $R_0\u003C1$), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show that in the simplest case, $R_0\u003C1$ if and only if the proportion of infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two cases studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted, highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction number\u003C1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0% of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.","publish_time":"2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"McLure, Angus; Glass, Kathryn","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8760f206472b115c9508781190223bf55b45e404.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00809v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reservoir exposure","imported cases","population heterogeneity","animal populations","general human population accounting","basic reproduction number","isolated populations","study hospital","animal reservoirs","cases studies of Clostridium difficile infection","importation-driven disease","disease extinction","disease prevalence","person transmission","local person","simple rules","external source","transmissible NAP1","proportion of infections","landmark study of hospitalised patients","survival","colonisation","interactions of multiple strains","RT027 strain of","threshold parameter","diseases","compartmental models","infected admissions","simplest case","humans","idea"],"language":"en"},

A public database was created by the authors using three public databases and by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 190 COVID-19, 1345 viral pneumonia, and 1341 normal chest x-ray images. An image augmented training set was created with around 2600 images of each category for training and validating four different pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks were tested for the classification of two different schemes (normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia). The classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision for both the schemes were 98.3%, 96.7%, 100%, 100% and 98.3%, 96.7%, 99%, 100%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosing cases with COVID-19.

However, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 pandemics now. Based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square error and robustness index to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in forecasting. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz\u0027s function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the ODE models, the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models are shown to be suitable for modeling the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Wuyue; Zhang, Dongyan; Peng, Liangrong; Zhuge, Changjing; Hong, Liu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/304a515db50dea49cc8127b885ba8f7ecba38861.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05666v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["various epidemic models","model robustness","dynamical models","ODE models","reliable forecast","SEIR-PO models","overestimation","model complexity","inflection point","reliable predictable model","public COVID","forecast ability","effective reproduction number","statistical inference methods","methods of sequential Bayesian","final epidemic size","severe threat of COVID","time dependent reproduction number","over-fitting","under-fitting","robustness index","SEIR-QD","Gomertz\u0027s function","Logistic function","study of epidemics","behavior of exponential growth method","rational evaluation of various possible choices","non-constant nature","root","square error","accuracy","underestimation","empirical functions","respect","Akaike information criterion","cities","follow-up actions of individuals","data","provinces","balance","crucial role","future trends","problems","China","governments","transition","forecasting","pandemics","systematical investigation","consideration","success","inclusion of self-protection","quarantine","spring","late stage","significance","cases","sensitivity","extensive simulations"],"language":"en"},

So far, the disease due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been countered with extreme measures at national level that attempt to suppress epidemic growth. However, these approaches require quick adoption and enforcement in order to effectively curb virus spread, and may cause unprecedented socio-economic impact. A viable alternative to mass surveillance and rule enforcement is harnessing collective intelligence by means of citizen empowerment. Mobile applications running on personal devices could significantly support this kind of approach by exploiting context/location awareness and data collection capabilities. In particular, technology-assisted location and contact tracing, if broadly adopted, may help limit the spread of infectious diseases by raising end-user awareness and enabling the adoption of selective quarantine measures.

With parametric specification based on literature on COVID-19, we investigate the sensitivities of various quantities on the optimal strategies, taking into account the subtle trade-off between the sanitary and the socio-economic cost of the pandemic, together with the limited capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. The optimal scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is released sufficiently slowly. We also provide optimal intervention measures with increasing ICU capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on detection of infectious and immune individuals.

The new type of corona virus COVID-19 disease was firstly discovered in Wuhan-China. However, recently, the virus has been widely spread in most of the world countries and is reported as a pandemic. Further, nowadays, all the world countries are striving to control the coronavirus disease COVID-19. There are many mechanisms to detect the coronavirus disease COVID-19 including clinical analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed COVID-19 patient manifests as fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly, several techniques can be used to detect the initial results of the virus such as medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost and it takes time to install them and use. Therefore, in this paper, a new framework is proposed to detect coronavirus disease COVID-19 using onboard smartphone sensors. The proposal provides a low-cost solution, since most of the radiologists have already held smartphones for different daily-purposes. People can use the framework on their smartphones for the virus detection purpose. Nowadays, smartphones are powerful with existing computation-rich processors, memory space, and large number of sensors including cameras, microphone, temperature sensor, inertial sensors, proximity, colour-sensor, humidity-sensor, and wireless chipsets/sensors. The designed Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled framework reads the smartphone sensors signal measurements to predict the grade of severity of the pneumonia as well as predicting the result of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maghdid, Halgurd S.; Ghafoor, Kayhan Zrar; Sadiq, Ali Safaa; Curran, Kevin; Rabie, Khaled","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d511f3a98d460f7967dd490e34d664caac1529d1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07434v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Artificial Intelligence"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus disease COVID","inertial sensors","confirmed COVID","smartphones","onboard smartphone sensors","new type of corona virus COVID","new framework","large number of sensors","virus detection purpose","temperature sensor","humidity-sensor","colour-sensor","world countries","initial results","blood test results","medical detection Kits","clinical analysis of chest CT scan images","memory space","proximity","microphone","existing computation-rich processors","fever","cameras","illness","tiredness","patient manifests","AI","measurements","famous family of viruses","wireless chipsets","designed Artificial Intelligence","grade of severity","huge cost","pneumonia","human","Coronaviruses","dry cough","time","radiologists","mechanisms","low-cost solution","proposal","devices","animals","purposes","paper","Wuhan-China","pandemic","People","techniques"],"language":"en"},

Recent works based on convolution neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways, and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation). Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Weiyi; Jacobs, Colin; Charbonnier, Jean-Paul; Ginneken, Bram van","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7de05a701b454474787de52f876f6d17d4ca2afe.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07443v4.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RTSU-Net","COVID","structured relationships","geometric relationships","structural relationships","convolution neural networks","convolution features","Pulmonary lobe segmentation","regional assessment of pulmonary diseases","nature of convolution","accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes","subjects","evaluation","proposed module","COPDGene study","novel non-local neural network module","training data available","computed tomography scans","critical role","good performance","airways","cases","self-attention weights","severe lung infection","Recent works","relational approach","lungs","cohort","transfer learning","models pre-trained","structures","vessels","borders","suspects","baselines","Experimental results","pleural wall","appearance","paper","task","retraining","shape"],"language":"en"},

The envelope mainly consists of the lipid bilayer, taken from the host cells at assembly/budding stage of the viral life cycle. Therefore the constitution of the lipid bilayer should be common in all SARS, MERS and influenza viruses, even after mutations, and thus these closely-related viruses will be disinfected by exposure to ethanol with the same concentration. Existing experimental data indicate that an ethanol concentration of 30~40 v/v% is sufficient to inactivate Influenza-A viruses in solution[1,2,3]. The author suggests that it may be possible to use alcoholic beverages of 16~20 v/v% concentration for this disinfection process, such as Whisky (1:1 hot water dilution) or Japanese Sake, because they are readily available and safe (non-toxic). By inhaling the alcohol vapor at 50~60$^\\circ$C (122~140$^\\circ$F) through the nose for one or two minutes, it will condense on surfaces inside the respiratory tract; mainly in the nasal cavity. The alcohol concentration will be intensified to ~36 v/v% by this process, which is enough to disinfect the corona virus on the mucous membrane. This method also provides more moisture into respiratory tract, and helps to clean the inside of the nasal cavity by stimulating blowing of the nose, and also makes the mucous escalator work actively so that the self-clearing mechanism in the trachea will remove viruses faster. An alternative prompt method is also discussed. We use 40 v/v% whisky or similar alcohol, dripping on a gauze, inhale the vapor slowly at room temperature. This method works well for the front part of the nasal cavity.

An abrupt ending of lockdown can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything; therefore, carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in post-lockdown phase, in this work, we propose an age- and social contact- structures dependent Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and Recovered (SFEIR) model. Simulating the SFEIR model on Indian population with fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear conditioning, underlies the importance of community driven changes in country specific mitigation of COVID-19 spread in post-lockdown phase.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Spandan; Sharma, Bhanu; Singh, Vikram","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4c6338cb743ece640f3fe092a6087d2b7eb62dd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13777v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFEIR"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["post-lockdown phase","media induced fear conditioning","inducing fear conditioning","role of fear conditioning","print media","mass media","influence of media","spread of COVID","abrupt ending of lockdown","proposed SFEIR model","severity of COVID","pandemic","growth of infected population","country specific mitigation of COVID","community radio","Indian population","present study","fraction of feared people","importance of community driven changes","conjunction","significant decrease","internet","television","social contact- structures dependent Susceptible","closure of schools","basic reproductive number","undo","age","important non-pharmaceutical intervention","work","year","positive reinforcement","designed exit strategies","benefits","enormous socio-economic side-effects","upliftment","countries"],"language":"en"},

Here, by ligating head-to-tail viral RNAs from bovine coronavirus-infected cells and sequencing across the ligated junctions, it was learned that at the time of peak viral RNA synthesis [6 hours postinfection (hpi)] the 3\u2019 poly(A) tail on genomic and sgmRNAs is ~65 nucleotides (nt) in length. Surprisingly, this length was found to vary throughout infection from ~45 nt immediately after virus entry (at 0 to 4 hpi) to ~65 nt later on (at 6 h to 9 hpi) and from ~65 nt (at 6 h to 9 hpi) to ~30 nt (at 120-144 hpi). With the same method, poly(U) sequences of the same lengths were simultaneously found on the ligated viral negative-strand RNAs. Functional analyses of poly(A) tail length on specific viral RNA species, furthermore, revealed that translation, in vivo, of RNAs with the longer poly(A) tail was enhanced over those with the shorter poly(A). Although the mechanisms by which the tail lengths vary is unknown, experimental results together suggest that the length of the poly(A) and poly(U) tails is regulated. One potential function of regulated poly(A) tail length might be that for the coronavirus genome a longer poly(A) favors translation. The regulation of coronavirus translation by poly(A) tail length resembles that during embryonal development suggesting there may be mechanistic parallels.","publish_time":"2013-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Hung-Yi; Ke, Ting-Yung; Liao, Wei-Yu; Chang, Nai-Yun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/710dd69c07a692bbdcd7261bb4508cd9935556c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3726627.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0070548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23923003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["longer poly","shorter poly","tail lengths","hpi","tail viral RNAs","Functional analyses of poly","potential function of regulated poly","regulation of coronavirus translation","ligated viral negative-strand RNAs","positive-strand coronavirus genome","specific viral RNA species","mRNAs of shorter lengths","time of peak viral RNA synthesis","bovine coronavirus-infected cells","ligated junctions","sequencing","kilobase","hours postinfection","subgenomic","embryonal development","experimental results","nucleotides","sgmRNAs","sequences","ligating head","co-terminal","virtue","polyadenylated untranslated region","capped leader","method","mechanistic parallels","virus entry","tails","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

In newborn calves flavonoids may improve health status, but little is known about the systemically availability of flavonoids in calves to exert biological effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the oral bioavailability of the flavonol quercetin, applied either as quercetin aglycone (QA) or as its glucorhamnoside rutin (RU), in newborn dairy calves. Twenty-one male newborn German Holstein calves were fed equal amounts of colostrum and milk replacer according to body weight. On d 2 and 29 of life, 9mg of quercetin equivalents/kg of body weight, either fed as QA or as RU, or no quercetin (control group) were fed together with the morning meal. Blood samples were taken before and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 24, and 48h after feed intake. Quercetin and quercetin metabolites with an intact flavonol structure (isorhamnetin, tamarixetin, and kaempferol) were analyzed in blood plasma after treatment with glucuronidase or sulfatase by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Maximum individual plasma concentration was depicted from the concentration-time-curve on d 2 and 29, respectively. Additional blood samples were taken to measure basal plasma concentrations of total protein, albumin, urea, and lactate as well as pre- and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, insulin, and cortisol. Plasma concentrations of quercetin and its metabolites were significantly higher on d 2 than on d 29 of life, and administration of QA resulted in higher plasma concentrations of quercetin and its metabolites than RU. The relative bioavailability of total flavonols (sum of quercetin and its metabolites isorhamnetin, tamarixetin, and kaempferol) from RU was 72.5% on d 2 and 49.6% on d 29 when compared with QA (100%). Calves fed QA reached maximum plasma concentrations of total flavonols much earlier than did RU-fed calves. Plasma metabolites and hormones were barely affected by QA and RU feeding in this experiment. Taken together, orally administrated QA resulted in a greater bioavailability of quercetin than RU on d 2 and 29, respectively, and quercetin bioavailability of quercetin and its metabolites differed markedly between calves aged 2 and 29 d.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maciej, J.; Sch\u00E4ff, C.

Infection with PLV protects cats from CD4\u002B T-cell decline caused by subsequent infection with virulent feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Previous studies implicate innate immune and/or cellular restriction mechanisms for FIV disease attenuation in PLV-infected cats. In this study, we evaluated viral infection and cytokine mRNA transcription in 12 different tissue reservoirs approximately five months post infection. We quantitated tissue proviral load, viral mRNA load and relative transcription of IL-10, IL-12p40 and IFN\u03B3 from tissues of cats exposed to FIV, PLV or both viruses and analyzed these parameters using a multivariate statistical approach. The distribution and intensity of FIV infection and IFN\u03B3 transcription differed between single and co-infected cats, characterized by higher FIV proviral loads and IFN\u03B3 expression in co-infected cat tissues. Variability in FIV mRNA load and IFN\u03B3 was significantly more constrained in co-infected versus singly infected cat tissues. Single-infected:co-infected ratios of FIV mRNA load compared to FIV proviral load indicated that active viral transcription was apparently inhibited during co-infection. These results indicate that previous PLV infection increases activation of tissue innate immunity and constrains the ability of FIV to productively infect tissue reservoirs of infection for months, independent of FIV proviral load, supporting a model in which innate immunity and/or modulation of target cell susceptibility play a key role in PLV-induced protection from FIV disease.","publish_time":"2011-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Xin; Carver, Scott; Troyer, Ryan M.; Terwee, Julie A.; VandeWoude, Sue","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a05173bdf26286064e4e13b8f5253330d9a9089b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3205387.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22069521/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v3101891","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLV","FIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intensity of FIV infection","ability of FIV","co-infection","PLV-infected cats","co-infected ratios of FIV mRNA load","independent of FIV proviral load","higher FIV proviral","co-infected cats","viral infection","FIV disease attenuation","previous PLV infection","tissue proviral load","tissue reservoirs of infection","subsequent infection","Single-infected","viral mRNA load","co-infected cat tissues","IFN\u03B3 transcription","tissues of cats","months post infection","cytokine mRNA transcription","domestic cats","active viral transcription","PLV-induced protection","IFN\u03B3 expression","activation of tissue innate immunity","different tissue reservoirs","relative transcription of IL","IL-12p40","Previous studies","T-cell decline","feline model of lentiviral cross-species transmission","virulent feline immunodeficiency virus","modulation of target cell susceptibility","key role","cellular restriction mechanisms","puma lentivirus","CD4","Pco","parameters","Variability","multivariate statistical approach","viruses","distribution","results","study"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection, known as COVID-19. Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs and, as such, global public authorities have so far relied upon non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources. The model is used to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 and the other respiratory pathogens in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season. Here, we show that increasing influenza vaccine uptake or enhancing the public health interventions would facilitate the management of respiratory outbreaks coinciding with the peak flu season, especially, compensate the shortage of the detection resources. However, how to increase influenza vaccination coverage rate remains challenging. Public health decision- and policy-makers should adopt evidence-informed strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Qian; Tang, Biao; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong","journal":"Math Biosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a60e5f418229143cbfd6bf2b3f0c53a2ec9d09ae.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556420300638; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556420300638?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza season","increasing influenza vaccine uptake","spread of COVID","effect of mass influenza vaccination","influenza vaccination coverage rate","public health interventions","Public health decision","risk of contracting COVID","respiratory pathogens","symptoms","detection resources","severe shortage of testing resources","emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV","management of respiratory outbreaks","respiratory infectious agents","health-care setting","peak flu season","global public authorities","detection kits","mathematical model","pharmaceutical interventions","admission","evidence-informed strategies","policy-makers","healthcare systems","case","coincidence","aspecific","ILI","treatment of people","resource-limited contexts","drugs","life-threatening infection","illness","present study","seasonal pattern","likelihood of nosocomial transmission","effective vaccines","NPIs","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice. METHODS: All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO\u2019s shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment. RESULTS: Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO\u2019s shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Price, Alex; Henke, Lauren E.; Maraghechi, Borna; Kim, Taeho; Spraker, Matthew B.; Hugo, Geoffrey D.; Robinson, Clifford G.; Knutson, Nels C.","journal":"Adv Radiat Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebbefdebca0d30b42ea7070062af645a54412859.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186133.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346656/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420300889; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420300889?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT","SBRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["timeliness of remote coverage","person RO coverage comfort levels","novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice","person treatment coverage practice","novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage","Average times of pre-treatment coverage","implementation","imaging console screen","RO\u2019s shared screen","transmission of COVID","visual quality","alternative methods of care","overall comfort","departments","vital radiation oncological care","level of specialty care","radiation oncologists","visual communication","high audio","average value","sequential fractions","observed failure modes","observed process failures","Image quality metrics","relative risk of transmission","reduced personnel","patient interactions","Likert scale surveys","comparison","RT procedures","ability","cross correlation","pandemic","means","RESULTS","survey questions","hospital","areas","CONCLUSIONS","support","CBCT","lag","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

Methods We studied 489 smear-positive adult TB patients and 305 household contact controls without TB with nasopharyngeal swab samples within an ongoing prospective cohort study in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, between 2013 and 2015. We used multiplex real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses and seven bacterial pathogens from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results The median age of the study participants was 33 years; 61% (484/794) were men, and 21% (168/794) were HIV-positive. TB patients had a higher prevalence of HIV (28.6%; 140/489) than controls (9.2%; 28/305). Overall prevalence of respiratory viral pathogens was 20.4% (160/794; 95%CI 17.7\u201323.3%) and of bacterial pathogens 38.2% (303/794; 95%CI 34.9\u201341.6%). TB patients and controls did not differ in the prevalence of respiratory viruses (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.00, 95%CI 0.71\u20131.44), but respiratory bacteria were less frequently detected in TB patients (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.53\u20130.94).

It is common within large dog populations, such as those in re\u2010homing or training kennels. Vaccines are vital in its management of CIRD, but they often fail to prevent disease. Recently, a number of novel pathogens have been identified in CIRD outbreaks and represent new targets for vaccination. KEY FINDINGS: Innate immune responses provide a vital first line of defence against the infectious agents involved in the development of CIRD. Once breeched, adaptive mucosal immunity is necessary to prevent infection and limit spread. Current vaccines target only a few of the agents involved in CIRD. Evidence, from the limited amount of published data, indicates that although vaccinating against these agents reduces infection rates, duration of shedding and severity of disease, it does not induce sterilising immunity; and this has important consequences for the management of the disease, and the future of CIRD vaccine development. SUMMARY: In the process of considering the development of novel CIRD vaccines, this paper focuses on the immunological mechanisms that provide protection for the respiratory tract, the current recommendations for canine vaccination, and the challenges surrounding existing CIRD vaccines, and their future development.","publish_time":"2015-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitchell, Judy A.; Brownlie, Joe","journal":"J Pharm Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61c9ab1d4b7162b712975c3ba666e6f2a4f1ea0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166679.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jphp.12380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25736813/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of CIRD","management of CIRD","CIRD outbreaks","development of novel CIRD vaccines","existing CIRD vaccines","future of CIRD vaccine development","severity of disease","Canine infectious respiratory disease","future development","Current vaccines","disease of multifactorial aetiology","infectious agents","canine vaccination","number of novel pathogens","respiratory tract","infection rates","multiple pathogens","current recommendations","sterilising immunity","adaptive mucosal immunity","Innate immune responses","duration of shedding","line of defence","paper","challenges","KEY FINDINGS","protection","important consequences","new targets","OBJECTIVES","re\u2010homing","immunological mechanisms","large dog populations","training kennels","limit spread","process","published data","Evidence","SUMMARY"],"language":"en"},

Despite the importance of influenza, there had been, until recently, little advance in its control since amantadine was licensed almost 40 years ago. During the past decade, evidence has accrued on the protection afforded by inactivated vaccines and the safety and efficacy in children of live influenza-virus vaccines. There have been many new developments in vaccine technology. Moreover, work on viral neuraminidase has led to the licensing of potent selective antiviral drugs, and economic decision modelling provides further justification for annual vaccination and a framework for the use of neuraminidase inhibitors. Progress has also been made on developing near-patient testing for influenza that may assist individual diagnosis or the recognition of widespread virus circulation, and so optimise clinical management. Despite these advances, the occurrence of avian H5N1, H9N2, and H7N7 influenza in human beings and the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome are reminders of our vulnerability to an emerging pandemic. The contrast between recent cases of H5N1 infection, associated with high mortality, and the typically mild, self-limiting nature of human infections with avian H7N7 and H9N2 influenza shows the gaps in our understanding of molecular correlates of pathogenicity and underlines the need for continuing international research into pandemic influenza. Improvements in animal and human surveillance, new approaches to vaccination, and increasing use of vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat annual influenza outbreaks are essential to reduce the global toll of pandemic and interpandemic influenza.","publish_time":"2003-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicholson, Karl G; Wood, John M; Zambon, Maria","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fa9056974c20cf9531a3d15820737288e80538a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112395.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603148544; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673603148544","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H7N7 influenza","influenza infections","H9N2 influenza","interpandemic influenza","importance of influenza","annual influenza outbreaks","children of live influenza-virus vaccines","use of vaccines","global toll of pandemic","human surveillance","human beings","avian H7N7","annual vaccination","inactivated vaccines","emerging pandemic","self-limiting nature of human infections","occurrence of avian H5N1","use of neuraminidase inhibitors","economic loss","new approaches","new developments","viral neuraminidase","licensing of potent selective antiviral drugs","economic decision modelling","huge toll of suffering","recent cases of H5N1 infection","recognition of widespread virus circulation","rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome","reminders","justification","framework","efficacy","gaps","need","vulnerability","safety","animal","individual diagnosis","understanding of molecular correlates of pathogenicity","amantadine","contrast","high mortality","diseases","international research","evidence","little advance","control","vaccine technology","protection","Improvements","advances","Summary","clinical management","patient testing","past decade","years","Progress"],"language":"en"},

Given their high lethality, a comprehensive understanding of filoviral pathogenesis is urgently needed. In the present studies, we revealed that the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC1) gene deletion protects vasculature in ex vivo explants from EBOV infection. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 using EPAC-specific inhibitors (ESIs) mimicked the EPAC1 knockout phenotype in the ex vivo model. ESI treatment dramatically decreased EBOV infectivity in both ex vivo vasculature and in vitro vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Furthermore, postexposure protection of ECs against EBOV infection was conferred using ESIs. Protective efficacy of ESIs in ECs was observed also in MARV infection. Additional studies using a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype that expresses EBOV glycoprotein (EGP-VSV) confirmed that ESIs reduced infection in ECs. Ultrastructural studies suggested that ESIs blocked EGP-VSV internalization via inhibition of macropinocytosis. The inactivation of EPAC1 affects the early stage of viral entry after viral binding to the cell surface, but before early endosome formation, in a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner.

We considered three highly contagious viruses that infect a wide range of domestic and wild mammals: canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine enteric coronaviruses (CECoV). Infection by either one of these viruses can affect populations through increased mortality and/or decreased general health. We investigated infection in the wolf populations of Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise National Park (PNALM), Italy, and of Mercantour National Park (PNM), France. Faecal samples were collected during one winter, from October to March, from four packs in PNALM (n = 79) and from four packs in PNM (n = 66). We screened samples for specific sequences of viral nucleic acids. To our knowledge, our study is the first documented report of CECoV infection in wolves outside Alaska, and of the large-scale occurrence of CPV-2 in European wolf populations. The results suggest that CPV-2 is enzootic in the population of PNALM, but not in PNM and that CECoV is episodic in both areas. We did not detect CDV. Our findings suggest that density and spatial distribution of susceptible hosts, in particular free-ranging dogs, can be important factors influencing infections in wolves.

Cholesterol is important for a post-adsorption step, allowing membrane rearrangements that facilitate virus entry.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Jiechao; Glende, Joerg; Schwegmann-Wessels, Christel; Enjuanes, Luis; Herrler, Georg; Ren, Xiaofeng","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e3195171b5ba079200c049f9045808d81cd9f0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20951168/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354210007448; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2010.10.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354210007448","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral membrane DRMs","membrane rearrangements","plasma membrane","S protein","Abstract Cholesterol","Cholesterol depletion","resistant membrane microdomains","Reduced infectivity of cholesterol","adsorption process","viral envelope","post-adsorption step","depleted TGEV","virus entry","post-M\u03B2CD treatment","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","sialic acid binding activity","spike","cellular DRM marker proteins","major constituent of detergent","aminopeptidase N","flotation analyses","comigrate","behavior","cyclodextrin","methyl-\u03B2","cold non-ionic detergents"],"language":"en"},

This study investigated the impacts of MERS epidemic on emergency care utilization and mortality in South Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A natural experimental study was conducted using healthcare utilization and mortality data of the entire Korean population. The number of monthly emergency room (ER) visits was investigated to identify changes in emergency care utilization during the MERS epidemic; these trends were also examined according to patients\u0027 demographic factors, disease severity, and region. Deaths within 7 days after visiting an ER were analyzed to evaluate the impact of the reduction in ER visits on mortality. RESULTS: The number of ER visits during the peak of the MERS epidemic (June 2015) decreased by 33.1% compared to the average figures from June 2014 and June 2016. The decrease was observed in all age, sex, and income groups, and was more pronounced for low-acuity diseases (acute otitis media: 53.0%; upper respiratory infections: 45.2%) than for high-acuity diseases (myocardial infarctions: 14.0%; ischemic stroke: 16.6%). No substantial changes were detected for the highest-acuity diseases, with increases of 3.5% for cardiac arrest and 2.4% for hemorrhagic stroke. The number of deaths within 7 days of an ER visit did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: During the MERS epidemic, the number of ER visits decreased in all age, sex, and socioeconomic groups, and decreased most sharply for low-acuity diseases. Nonetheless, there was no significant change in deaths after emergency care.","publish_time":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sun Young; Khang, Young-Ho; Lim, Hwa-Kyung","journal":"Yonsei Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c15a612b305f3a174a6f69c0ec4de0dd85afb646.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1ce4231aeefd5ac1caef8246df9984b7455d16df.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c58195e4e9894fdbf2e89872912cd0fb46c9f947.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6660446.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2019.60.8.796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347336/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["number of ER visits","impacts of MERS epidemic","number of deaths","emergency care utilization","low-acuity diseases","highest-acuity diseases","high-acuity diseases","number of monthly emergency room","healthcare utilization","mortality data","epidemic of Middle East respiratory syndrome","South Korea","sex","days","income groups","socioeconomic groups","substantial changes","significant change","hemorrhagic stroke","ischemic stroke","natural experimental study","upper respiratory infections","acute otitis media","myocardial infarctions","disease severity","increases","patients\u0027 demographic factors","peak","entire Korean population","METHODS","reduction","cardiac arrest","region","MATERIALS","trends","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","average figures","decrease","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

Clinical translation has been often hampered by poor biodistribution, however. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) appear as a possibility to increase the cellular delivery of non-permeant biomolecules such as nucleic acids. This review focuses on CPP-delivery of several classes of oligonucleotides (ONs), namely antisense oligonucleotides, splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) and siRNAs. Two main strategies have been used to transport ONs with CPPs: covalent conjugation (which is more appropriate for charge-neutral ON analogues) and non-covalent complexation (which has been used for siRNA delivery essentially). Chemical synthesis, mechanisms of cellular internalization and various applications will be reviewed. A comprehensive coverage of the enormous amount of published data was not possible.

Delirium, a dangerous untoward prognostic development, serves as a barometer of systemic injury in critical illness. The early reports of 25% encephalopathy from China are likely a gross underestimation, which we know occurs whenever delirium is not monitored with a valid tool. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 are at accelerated risk for delirium due to at least seven factors including (1) direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion, (2) induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, (3) secondary effect of other organ system failure, (4) effect of sedative strategies, (5) prolonged mechanical ventilation time, (6) immobilization, and (7) other needed but unfortunate environmental factors including social isolation and quarantine without family. Given early insights into the pathobiology of the virus, as well as the emerging interventions utilized to treat the critically ill patients, delirium prevention and management will prove exceedingly challenging, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). The main focus during the COVID-19 pandemic lies within organizational issues, i.e., lack of ventilators, shortage of personal protection equipment, resource allocation, prioritization of limited mechanical ventilation options, and end-of-life care. However, the standard of care for ICU patients, including delirium management, must remain the highest quality possible with an eye towards long-term survival and minimization of issues related to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This article discusses how ICU professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacologists) can use our knowledge and resources to limit the burden of delirium on patients by reducing modifiable risk factors despite the imposed heavy workload and difficult clinical challenges posed by the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kotfis, Katarzyna; Williams Roberson, Shawniqua; Wilson, Jo Ellen; Dabrowski, Wojciech; Pun, Brenda T.; Ely, E.

One hypothesis is that stress signals released by aluminum-exposed necrotic cells play a role in modulating an immune response that contributes to the adjuvant\u2019s effectiveness. We hypothesized that aluminum adjuvant-induced necrosis would be similar irrespective of cellular origin or composition of the adjuvant. To test this hypothesis, human macrophages derived from peripheral monocytic cell line (THP-1) and cells derived from the human brain (primary astrocytes) were evaluated. Three commercially available formulations of ABAs (Alhydrogel, Imject alum, and Adju-Phos) were examined. Alum was also used as a reference. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species formation, and production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03B1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified. Cells were exposed to different concentrations (10-100 \u00B5g/mL) of the adjuvants for 24 h or 72 h. The two FDA approved adjuvants (Alhydrogel and Adju-Phos) decreased cell viability in both cell types. At the 72 h time point, the decrease in viability was accompanied with increased ROS formation. The size of the aluminum agglomerates was not relatable to the changes observed. After exposure to ABAs, astrocytes and macrophages presented a distinct profile of cytokine secretion which may relate to the function and unique characteristics of each cell type. These variations indicate that aluminum adjuvants may have differing capability of activating cells of different origin and thus their utility in specific vaccine design should be carefully assessed for optimum efficacy.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nies, Isaac; Hidalgo, Krisha; Bondy, Stephen C.; Campbell, Arezoo","journal":"Environ Toxicol Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a371a6768f09d071785438637df5b2ea5d19b354.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189866.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668920300806?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388105/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1382668920300806; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2020.103404","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aluminum adjuvants","Cell viability","cell types","aluminum agglomerates","aluminum-exposed necrotic cells","Abstract Aluminum-based adjuvants","human macrophages","aluminum adjuvant-induced necrosis","Alhydrogel","peripheral monocytic cell line","Adju-Phos","FDA approved adjuvants","human vaccines","human brain","hypothesis","differing capability of activating cells of different origin","available formulations of ABAs","cellular origin","specific pathogens","different concentrations","Imject alum","primary astrocytes","increased ROS formation","specific vaccine design","h time point","reactive oxygen species formation","magnitude of protective immune responses","production of tumor necrosis factor alpha","TNF-\u03B1","decrease","utility","role","THP","distinct profile of cytokine secretion","stress signals","composition","unique characteristics","function","interleukin","\u00B5g","exposure","adjuvant\u2019s effectiveness","changes","size","variations","optimum efficacy","reference"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that the host response to a single JHMV-specific immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitope is critical for severe disease. We engineered a recombinant JHMV with mutations in the immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitope (rJ.M(Y135Q)). Infection of na\u00EFve B6 mice with this virus resulted in mild disease with no mortality. However, introduction of a CD4 T-cell epitope from Listeria monocytogenes into rJ.M(Y135Q) generated a highly virulent virus. The decrease in disease severity was not due to a switch from Th1 to Th2 predominance in rJ.M(Y135Q)-infected mice, an effect on CD8 T-cell function, or differential expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 by JHMV-specific CD4 T cells. These results show that the response to a single virus-specific CD4 T-cell epitope may contribute to a pathogenic host response in the setting of acute viral disease and that abrogation of this response ameliorates clinical disease without diminishing virus clearance.","publish_time":"2006-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anghelina, Daniela; Pewe, Lecia; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bc58a6f36cf62a7d4e064bb18edab126936718d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/15e6b2134b5cfefba6bfb825889a1e2ffc87d895.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1698761.xml.json","url":"http://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002944010614447/pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944010614447; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944010614447","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JHMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single virus-specific CD4 T-cell epitope","JHMV-specific CD4 T cells","virulent virus","single JHMV-specific immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitope","severe disease","virus-induced host immune response","CD8 T-cell function","mouse hepatitis virus","diminishing virus clearance","pathogenic host response","rJ","clinical disease","infected mice","mild disease","disease severity","Y135Q","direct virus destruction of infected cells","recombinant JHMV","setting of acute viral disease","severe encephalitis","Acute viral encephalitis","Infection of na\u00EFve B6 mice","differential expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","JHM strain","effect","abrogation","Listeria monocytogenes","mutations","Th2 predominance","relative contribution","switch","Th1","death","C57BL","introduction","example","decrease","mortality","days","results"],"language":"en"},

The Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) project, a 5-year (2012\u20132016) multiagency and multidisciplinary collaboration, aimed to measure disease burden, epidemiology, aetiology, risk factors, immunology, effectiveness of vaccination and other prevention strategies for influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases of public health importance. Two active, prospective, population-based surveillance systems were established for monitoring influenza and other respiratory pathogens among those hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness and those enrolled patients seeking consultations at sentinel general practices. In 2015, a sero-epidemiological study will use a sample of patients from the same practices. These data will provide a full picture of the disease burden and risk factors from asymptomatic infections to severe hospitalized disease and deaths and related economic burden. The results during the first 2 years (2012\u20132013) provided scientific evidence to (a) support a change to NZ\u0027s vaccination policy for young children due to high influenza hospitalizations in these children; (b) contribute to the revision of the World Health Organization\u0027s case definition for severe acute respiratory illness for global influenza surveillance; and (c) contribute in part to vaccine strain selection using vaccine effectiveness assessment in the prevention of influenza-related consultations and hospitalizations. In summary, SHIVERS provides valuable international platforms for supporting seasonal influenza control and pandemic preparedness, and responding to other emerging/endemic respiratory-related infections.","publish_time":"2015-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Qiu Sue; Turner, Nikki; Baker, Michael G; Williamson, Deborah A; Wong, Conroy; Webby, Richard; Widdowson, Marc-Alain","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d76f48664d2e90c67768d51a2efda3e12c316ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4474494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25912617/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12315","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevention of influenza","monitoring influenza","global influenza surveillance","seasonal influenza control","high influenza hospitalizations","Southern Hemisphere Influenza","respiratory pathogens","disease burden","severe acute respiratory illness","endemic respiratory-related infections","effectiveness of vaccination","hospitalized patients","related consultations","severe hospitalized disease","Vaccine Effectiveness Research","vaccine effectiveness assessment","related economic burden","risk factors","better pandemic preparedness","enrolled patients","pdm09 pandemic","sample of patients","SHIVERS","respiratory infectious diseases of public health importance","vaccine strain selection","asymptomatic infections","young children","population-based surveillance systems","prevention strategies","scientific evidence","NZ\u0027s vaccination policy","improved scientific knowledge","sentinel general practices","World Health Organization\u0027s case definition","deaths","valuable international platforms","need","aetiology","revision","immunology","epidemiology","change","summary","project","picture","H1N1","multidisciplinary collaboration","sero-epidemiological study","results","years","data"],"language":"en"},

For the actual COVID-19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed. Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns-Hopkins-University to the data of the German Robert-Koch-Institut we use the COVID-19 data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) as a base for the parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown.

Here we take the opposite approach -- that we call reverse epidemiology. Given the data, we reconstruct backward in time an ensemble of networks of contacts, and we assess the impact of measures on that specific realization of the contagion process. This approach is robust because it only depends on parameters that describe the evolution of the disease within one individual (e.g. latency time) and not on parameters that describe the spread of the epidemics in a population. Using this method, we assess the impact of preventive quarantine on the ongoing outbreak of Covid-19 in Italy.

To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here, the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such as during large social gatherings, are also presented.

With a basic reproduction number equal to 2, and 14-day infectious period, an infected person staying more than 9 hours in the event could infect other people.

Recently, many countries that suffer from coronavirus crises attempt to access citizen\u0027s location data to eliminate the outbreak. However, it raises privacy concerns and may open the doors to more invasive forms of surveillance in the name of public health. It also brings a challenge for privacy protection techniques: how can we leverage people\u0027s mobile data to help combat the pandemic without scarifying our location privacy. We demonstrate that we can have the best of the two worlds by implementing policy-based location privacy for epidemic surveillance. Specifically, we formalize the privacy policy using graphs in light of differential privacy, called policy graph. Our system has three primary functions for epidemic surveillance: location monitoring, epidemic analysis, and contact tracing. We provide an interactive tool allowing the attendees to explore and examine the usability of our system: (1) the utility of location monitor and disease transmission model estimation, (2) the procedure of contact tracing in our systems, and (3) the privacy-utility trade-offs w.r.t. different policy graphs. The attendees can find that it is possible to have the full functionality of epidemic surveillance while preserving location privacy.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Yang; Takagi, Shun; Xiao, Yonghui; Xiong, Li; Yoshikawa, Masatoshi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1aeff34b793834e144b4702a99c7709a45a02c7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00186v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["privacy policy","policy-based location privacy","privacy concerns","epidemic surveillance system","privacy-utility trade-offs","functionality of epidemic surveillance","light of differential privacy","privacy protection techniques","location monitoring","epidemic analysis","utility of location monitor","citizen\u0027s location data","different policy graphs","invasive forms of surveillance","attendees","procedure of contact tracing","people\u0027s mobile data","disease transmission model estimation","primary functions","doors","coronavirus crises","worlds","pandemic","systems","challenge","outbreak","countries","interactive tool","public health","usability","best","demonstration"],"language":"en"},

A similar event is experienced by some healthcare systems regularly, due to for instance seasonal spikes in the number of patients. We model this as a queueing system in heavy traffic (where the arrival rate is approaching the service rate from below) or in overload (where the arrival rate exceeds the service rate). In both cases we assume that customers (patients) may have different priorities and we consider two popular service disciplines: static priorities and accumulating priorities. It has been shown that the latter allows for patients of all classes to be seen in a timely manner as long as the system is stable. We demonstrate however that if accumulating priorities are used in the heavy traffic or overload regime, then all patients, including those with the highest priority, will experience very long waiting times. If on the other hand static priorities are applied, then one can ensure that the highest-priority patients will be seen in a timely manner even in overloaded systems.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oz, Binyamin; Shneer, Seva; Ziedins, Ilze","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65a65e84a5e6d3f75bd5f9439597b7292c20774a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14087v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["service rate","accumulating priorities","arrival rate","different priorities","number of patients","highest-priority patients","hand static priorities","healthcare systems","heavy traffic","overloaded systems","timely manner","highest priority","popular service disciplines","long waiting times","overload regime","queueing system","unprecedented times","instance seasonal spikes","COVID","customers","world","similar event","cases","classes","limits","capacity"],"language":"en"},

The analysis exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate spending dropped by around 25 percent in Sweden and, as a result of the shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points in Denmark. This implies that most of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless of social distancing laws.

For that to occur, we have to reduce the wind mass-loss rate by a factor of about four from its commonly used value. This strengthens an early conclusion, which was based on exoplanets with circular orbits, that states that to have a non-negligible fraction of AGB stars that engulf planets we should consider lower wind mass-loss rates of isolated AGB stars (before they are spun-up by a companion).

Migrants struggle to start their lives over in Colombia, having arrived with few economic resources, and often no legal documentation, in cities with little to offer them. Venezuelan migrants, however, rely heavily on mobile phones and social media networks as lifelines for information, opportunities, and resources -- making WhatsApp both a critical tool for migrants\u0027 settlement and integration, as well as an invaluable source of data through which we can better understand migrant experiences. This thesis explores the dynamics of public WhatsApp groups used by Venezuelan migrants to Colombia, and what they can tell us about how migrants use and share information.

Designing appropriate interventions and identifying the concerns of those most at risk requires methods that can extract worries, concerns and emotional responses from text data. We examine gender differences and the effect of document length on worries about the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Our findings suggest that i) shorter texts do not offer an as adequate insight into psychological processes as longer texts. We further find ii) marked gender differences in topics concerning emotional responses. Women worried more about their loved ones and severe health concerns while men were more occupied with effects on the economy and society. The findings align with general gender differences in language found elsewhere, but the current unique circumstances likely amplified these effects.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, sore throat, and fever. Symptoms can progress to a severe form of pneumonia with critical complications, including septic shock, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. While medical imaging is not currently recommended in Canada for primary diagnosis of COVID-19, computer-aided diagnosis systems could assist in the early detection of COVID-19 abnormalities and help to monitor the progression of the disease, potentially reduce mortality rates. In this study, we compare popular deep learning-based feature extraction frameworks for automatic COVID-19 classification. To obtain the most accurate feature, which is an essential component of learning, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, ResNet, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, VGGNet, NASNet were chosen amongst a pool of deep convolutional neural networks. The extracted features were then fed into several machine learning classifiers to classify subjects as either a case of COVID-19 or a control. This approach avoided task-specific data pre-processing methods to support a better generalization ability for unseen data. The performance of the proposed method was validated on a publicly available COVID-19 dataset of chest X-ray and CT images. The DenseNet121 feature extractor with Bagging tree classifier achieved the best performance with 99% classification accuracy.

We conducted the first investigation to use the genome wide association (GWA) approach to identify putative risk variants for ALI. Genome wide genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human Quad 610 BeadChip. We performed a two-stage GWA study followed by a third stage of functional characterization. In the discovery phase (Phase 1), we compared 600 European American trauma-associated ALI cases with 2266 European American population-based controls. We carried forward the top 1% of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at p\u003C0.01 to a replication phase (Phase 2) comprised of a nested case-control design sample of 212 trauma-associated ALI cases and 283 at-risk trauma non-ALI controls from ongoing cohort studies. SNPs that replicated at the 0.05 level in Phase 2 were subject to functional validation (Phase 3) using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses in stimulated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) in family trios. 159 SNPs from the discovery phase replicated in Phase 2, including loci with prior evidence for a role in ALI pathogenesis. Functional evaluation of these replicated SNPs revealed rs471931 on 11q13.3 to exert a cis-regulatory effect on mRNA expression in the PPFIA1 gene (p = 0.0021). PPFIA1 encodes liprin alpha, a protein involved in cell adhesion, integrin expression, and cell-matrix interactions. This study supports the feasibility of future multi-center GWA investigations of ALI risk, and identifies PPFIA1 as a potential functional candidate ALI risk gene for future research.","publish_time":"2012-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Christie, Jason D.; Wurfel, Mark M.; Feng, Rui; O\u0027Keefe, Grant E.; Bradfield, Jonathan; Ware, Lorraine B.; Christiani, David C.; Calfee, Carolyn S.; Cohen, Mitchell J.; Matthay, Michael; Meyer, Nuala J.; Kim, Cecilia; Li, Mingyao; Akey, Joshua; Barnes, Kathleen C.; Sevransky, Jonathan; Lanken, Paul N.; May, Addison K.; Aplenc, Richard; Maloney, James P.; Hakonarson, Hakon","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41546fbae5ea1a9c511d17fa9d9b583f944eda95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3266233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22295056/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028268","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["Illumina Human Quad"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discovery phase","ALI pathogenesis","replication phase","replicated SNPs","European American trauma-associated ALI cases","potential functional candidate ALI risk gene","at-risk trauma non-ALI controls","feasibility of future multi-center GWA investigations of ALI risk","PPFIA1 gene","functional validation","Functional evaluation","stage GWA study","stage of functional characterization","mRNA expression","integrin expression","cell adhesion","expression quantitative trait loci","high associated mortality","putative risk variants","cell-matrix interactions","genome wide association","Genome wide genotyping","stimulated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines","European American population-based controls","B-LCL","future research","analyses","severe hypoxemia","eQTL","approach","pulmonary infiltrates","patients","protein","ongoing cohort studies","nested case-control design sample","role","syndrome","prior evidence","cis-regulatory effect","critical illness","Illumina Human Quad","11q13","rs471931","single nucleotide polymorphisms","liprin alpha","Acute Lung Injury","BeadChip","family trios","level"],"language":"en"},

The gradual improvement of tissue culture systems for HBV has enabled the identification of viral determinants for viral infectivity and facilitated the discovery of the human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (hNTCP) as a liver specific receptor of HBV and its satellite, the human Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV). These findings are currently leading basic and clinical research activities in new directions. (1) Stable hNTCP-expressing cell lines have become a valuable platform to study the full HBV replication cycle from its native template, the cccDNA. (2) The suitability of NTCP complemented cell culture systems for high throughput screening approaches will facilitate identification of novel host factors involved in HBV replication (including those that determine the peculiar host specificity of HBV infection) and will enable identification and development of novel drug candidates for improved therapeutics. (3) Since NTCP is a major host-specific restriction factor for HBV and HDV, hNTCP-expressing animals provide the basis for future susceptible in vivo models. (4) The concept obtained with the entry inhibitor Myrcludex B demonstrates that NTCP is a suitable target for clinical interference with viral entry. This will foster further clinical approaches aiming at curative combination therapies.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wenhui; Urban, Stephan","journal":"Journal of Hepatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8097952f917ec4d94c196d2c672dece4a64de1d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114860.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27084034/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827816000921; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2016.02.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168827816000921","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV","HDV","NTCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBV replication cycle","liver specific receptor of HBV","peculiar host specificity of HBV infection","clinical approaches","human Hepatitis B Virus","viral entry","identification of viral determinants","identification of novel host factors","human Hepatitis Delta Virus","specific binding","clinical interference","discovery","hepatocytes","viral infectivity","HDV","Stable hNTCP","suitability of NTCP complemented cell culture systems","major host-specific restriction factor","early events of virus infection","clinical research activities","cell lines","entry inhibitor Myrcludex B","gradual improvement of tissue culture systems","human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide","high throughput screening approaches","development of novel drug candidates","attachment","satellite","suitable target","basis","animals","native template","improved therapeutics","new directions","valuable platform","curative combination therapies","models","concept","findings","decades","cccDNA","Summary"],"language":"en"},

The management of respiratory virus infections prior to hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is difficult. We examined whether respiratory virus detection before HCT influenced the requirement for bronchoscopy, hospitalization, and overall survival following HCT. Methods. Pre-HCT and weekly post-HCT nasal washes were collected through day 100 from patients with and without symptoms. Samples were tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and human rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and bocavirus. Results. Of 458 patients, 116 (25%) had respiratory viruses detected pre-HCT. Overall, patients with viruses detected pre-HCT had fewer days alive and out of the hospital and lower survival at day 100 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3\u20134.5; P = .007) than patients with negative samples; this risk was also present with rhinovirus alone (aHR for mortality, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2\u20135.5; P = .01). No difference in bronchoscopy incidence was seen in patients with and without respiratory viruses (aHR, 1.3; 95% CI, .8\u20132.0; P = .32). In symptomatic patients, those with respiratory viruses detected had increased overall mortality compared with patients without viruses detected (unadjusted HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.0\u201312.1; P = .05); among asymptomatic patients, detection of respiratory viruses was not associated with increased mortality. Conclusions. These data support routine testing for respiratory viruses among symptomatic patients before HCT, and delay of transplant with virus detection when feasible, even for detection of rhinovirus alone. Further study is needed to address whether asymptomatic patients should undergo screening for respiratory virus detection before HCT.","publish_time":"2015-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campbell, Angela P.; Guthrie, Katherine A.; Englund, Janet A.; Farney, Robert M.; Minerich, Elisa L.; Kuypers, Jane; Corey, Lawrence; Boeckh, Michael","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27940da5e1b0cb605d437565bc2f163d997a3694.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4565994.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/61/2/192/16787804/civ272.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25847977/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of respiratory viruses","respiratory virus detection","Pre-HCT","asymptomatic patients","respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenza viruses","management of respiratory virus infections","detection of rhinovirus","overall mortality","aHR","weekly post-HCT nasal washes","overall survival","increased mortality","human metapneumovirus","delay of transplant","human rhinoviruses","lower survival","bronchoscopy incidence","negative samples","hematopoietic cell transplant","multiplex polymerase chain reaction","adenovirus","data support routine testing","screening","fewer days alive","adjusted hazard ratio","hospitalization","requirement","coronaviruses","risk","unadjusted HR","bocavirus","difference","confidence interval","study","symptoms","Methods","Conclusions","Background","Results"],"language":"en"},

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 50 consecutive patients receiving high-dose CS for rheumatic diseases who have no pelvic pain were recruited. MRI of both hips was performed on all patients using a 1.5 Tesla to diagnose ON. Results: Of 50 subjects, 18 (36%) developed ON of the femoral head. Groups with and without ON were comparable in terms of sex, age and mean starting CS dose. There was no statistical difference in the type of CS regimen including daily dose, peak dose and cumulative dose between the two groups. However, silent ON was associated with both the cumulative CS dose and the duration of CS therapy. Conclusion: According to high prevalence of ON in our selected patients with no other identifiable risk factor for ON, monitoring of high risk patients with periodic hip MRI would help diagnose necrosis in early stage.","publish_time":"2015-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kianmehr, Nahid; Bidari, Ali; Mofidi, Mani; Bahar, Nasim","journal":"Med J Islam Repub Iran","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/200eee0824f97c373a016370a5292af80121f351.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4715417.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715417/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Osteonecrosis"],"organizations":["CS","Tesla"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high-dose CS","cumulative CS dose","cumulative dose","daily dose","peak dose","high risk patients","asymptomatic patients","high prevalence","type of CS regimen","consecutive patients","selected patients","duration of CS therapy","risk of asymptomatic prevalence","different diseases","systemic rheumatic diseases","femoral head","Groups","identifiable risk factor","different dosages","periodic hip MRI","impact of variable steroid regimens","relationship","cross-sectional study","corticosteroid","terms of sex","disabling complications","statistical difference","medications","pelvic pain","evidence","early stage","Methods","hips","Conclusion","Background","Osteonecrosis","Results","subjects","Tesla"],"language":"en"},

The results indicate presence of Massachusetts and 793/B IBV strains in commercial broilers in southern Iraq.","publish_time":"2016-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seger, Waleed; Ghalyanchi Langeroudi, Arash; Karimi, Vahid; Madadgar, Omid; Vasfi Marandi, Mehdi; Hashemzadeh, Masoud","journal":"Vet Res Forum","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85166a1c79d32bc2df2984260f1facc1a4d6148b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5251354.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5251354/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","IB","Tracheal"],"locations":["Massachusetts","southern Iraq","Iraq"],"keyphrases":["B IBV strains","results of real-time RT-PCR","IBV serotypes","conventional RT-PCR","specific primers of IB","results of nested PCR","List B","XCE2- Primers","commercial broilers","presence of Massachusetts","Primers MCE1","positive samples","specific nucleotide sequences of Massachusetts","infectious bronchitis virus","Avian infectious bronchitis","commercial broiler flocks","southern Iraq","south of Iraq","infected flocks","D274 genotypes","real-time polymerase chain reaction","faster techniques","diagnostic methods","governorates","high mortality","Muthana","economic loss","Basra","renal involvements","Thi-Qar","disease","detection","layers","comparison","BCE1","OIE","study","DCE1","Tracheal specimens","gammacoronavirus","research"],"language":"en"},

Around 75% of all CAP diagnosed are treated in the Emergency Department (ED). The CAP represents the main cause for sepsis and septic shock in ED, and the most frequent cause of death and admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to infectious disease. Overall mortality is 10-14% according to age and associated risk factors. Forty to 60% of CAP will require hospital admission, including observation units (with very variable ranges from 22-65% according to centers, seasonal of the year and patients\u00B4 characteristics). Between the admissions, 2-10% will be in the ICU. All of previously mentioned reflects the importance of the CAP in the ED, as well as the \u201Cimpact of the emergency care on the patient with CAP\u201D, as it is the establishment where the initial, but key decisions, are made and could condition the outcome of the illness. It is known the great variability among physicians in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of CAP, which is one of the reasons that explains the great differences in the admission rates, achievement of the microbiological diagnosis, request for complementary studies, the choice of antimicrobial treatment, or the diversity of applied care. In this sense, the implementation of clinical practice guidelines with the use of the severity scores and the new tools available, such as biomarkers, can improve patient care with CAP in ED. Therefore, a multidisciplinary group of emergency professionals and specialists involved in the care process of CAP has designed a guideline with several recommendations for decisions-making during the key moments in patients with CAP attended in the ED.","publish_time":"2018-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Juli\u00E1n-Jim\u00E9nez, Agust\u00EDn; Valero, Inmaculada Ad\u00E1n; L\u00F3pez, Alicia Beteta; Mart\u00EDn, Luis Miguel Cano; Rodr\u00EDguez, Olga Fern\u00E1ndez; D\u00EDaz, Rafael Rubio; Berrocal, M\u00AA Antonia Sep\u00FAlveda; del Castillo, Juan Gonz\u00E1lez; Gonz\u00E1lez, Francisco Javier Candel","journal":"Rev Esp Quimioter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dedc4700c705e92f673764ae9959fac57f1e2e7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6159381.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6159381/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","Intensive Care Unit","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["care process of CAP","emergency care","therapeutic management of CAP","patient care","patients","Intensive Care Unit","diversity of applied care","admission rates","hospital admission","key decisions","Emergency Department","ICU","main cause","multidisciplinary group of emergency professionals","great differences","key moments","great variability","variable ranges","frequent cause of death","complementary studies","microbiological diagnosis","request","achievement","diagnostic","specialists","sepsis","severity scores","new tools available","choice of antimicrobial treatment","physicians","years","observation units","septic shock","biomarkers","implementation of clinical practice guidelines","pneumonia","associated risk factors","sense","inhabitants","high comorbidity","cases","infectious disease","incidence of community","centers","establishment","recommendations","reasons","characteristics","impact","importance","Overall mortality","outcome","illness","admissions"],"language":"en"},

Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals. It should be acknowledged that this model predicts the number of deaths of all COVID-19 cases, including those who will not be confirmed as COVID-19, because of non-testing or death prior to COVID-19 identification. This serious health issue requires both long-term and short-term planning and arrangements. Social distancing, and identification and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases are believed to be the most important and effective control measure, and should be strengthened soon.

METHODS We prospectively enrolled 30 treatment-na\u00EFve patients with confirmed COVID-19 after informed consent at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The patients were randomized 1\uFF1A1 to HCQ group and the control group. Patients in HCQ group were given HCQ 400 mg per day for 5 days plus conventional treatments, while those in the control group were given conventional treatment only. The primary endpoint was negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in respiratory pharyngeal swab on days 7 after randomization. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and registered online (NCT04261517). RESULTS One patient in HCQ group developed to severe during the treatment. On day 7, nucleic acid of throat swabs was negative in 13 (86.7%) cases in the HCQ group and 14 (93.3%) cases in the control group (P\u003E0.05). The median duration from hospitalization to virus nucleic acid negative conservation was 4 (1,9) days in HCQ group, which is comparable to that in the control group [2 (1,4) days, Z=1.27, P\u003E0.05]. The median time for body temperature normalization in HCQ group was 1 (0,2) day after hospitalization, which was also comparable to that in the control group [1 (0,3) day]. Radiological progression was shown on CT images in 5 cases (33.3%) of the HCQ group and 7 cases (46.7%) of the control group, and all patients showed improvement in follow-up examinations. Four cases (26.7%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function (P\u003E0.05). CONCLUSIONS The prognosis of COVID-19 moderate patients is good. Larger sample size study are needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.

METHODS The clinical data of 20 children who were diagnosed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 20 to March 4, 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS Among the 20 children, there were 7 boys (35%) and 13 girls (65%), aged 8 months to 14 years (mean 8\u00B15 years). All these children had no clinical manifestations and attended the hospital for an epidemiological history of SARS-CoV-2. Nineteen children were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nasopharyngeal swabs were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in all 20 children. There were 4 children (20%) of mild type, 16 children (80%) of common type, and no children of severe type or critical type. The mean peripheral blood leukocyte count was (6.8\u00B13.5)\u00D7109/L, and 7 children had an abnormal peripheral blood leukocyte count, with an increase in 5 children and a reduction in 2 children. One child had a decreased absolute value of lymphocytes (0.87\u00D7109/L), 3 children had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20-42 mm/h), 7 children had an increased lactate dehydrogenase level (\u003E400 U/L), and 4 children had an increased blood lactate level (\u003E1.6 mmol/L). Chest CT showed single or multiple small nodule shadows, patchy shadows, and ground-glass shadows in the middle or lateral lobe of lungs or under the pleura in 13 children. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly occur with family aggregation. Most of the children with asymptomatic infection have no obvious abnormalities in blood routine and other laboratory tests. Changes in chest CT scan can be used as an aid for early diagnosis of asymptomatic infection in children.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jun; Wang, Xian-Feng; Zhang, Pei-Fa","journal":"Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434633/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children of severe type","epidemiological features of children","CONCLUSIONS Pediatric cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV","family aggregation of SARS","early diagnosis of asymptomatic infection","epidemiological history of SARS","increased blood lactate level","blood routine","critical type","mild type","common type","mean peripheral blood leukocyte count","abnormal peripheral blood leukocyte count","patchy shadows","increased lactate dehydrogenase level","clinical data","clinical manifestations","years","asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","ground-glass shadows","chest CT scan","multiple small nodule shadows","increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate","obvious abnormalities","aid","PCR-positive","hospital","lateral lobe of lungs","decreased absolute value of lymphocytes","Nasopharyngeal swabs","laboratory tests","Changes","pleura","mmol","METHODS","reduction","OBJECTIVE","months","RESULTS","boys","girls"],"language":"en"},

The WHO named this coronavirus 2019-nCoV, with COVID-19 being the name for diseases allied with it. Objective The study intended to examine the features and characteristics of existing human coronaviruses and identify their resemblance to the newly identified 2019-nCoV. Design The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19. Articles published on or before April 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: \u0022Coronavirus\u0022 or \u00222019-nCoV\u0022 or \u0022COVID-19\u0022 or \u0022SARS-CoV\u0022 or \u0022MERS-CoV\u0022 or \u0022Bat SARS-CoV\u0022 or \u0022ACE2 receptor\u0022. Setting This study was take place in School of Pharmacy, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur, India. Results The undistinguishable similarity of the genomic sequences of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and Bat SARS-CoV-bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-to nCoV-2019 has facilitated the process of identifying primary treatment measures. Researchers are presuming the existence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding in nCoV-2019, as in SARS-CoV. Researchers have been examining human-to-human transmission, the possibility of an intermediate host between bats and humans, and the existence of asymptomatic cases. An incubation period of 0 to 14 days has been reported, with acute to chronic symptoms being cough, nasal congestion, high fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, invasive lesions in both lungs, respiratory failure, and even death, including in pediatric cases. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective. Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time. Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action. Conclusions First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time. The unpredictable trajectory of this outbreak demands careful surveillance to monitor the situation, draw strategies, implement control measures, and create proper ethical laws and medical guidelines.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Tahseen; Agnihotri, Kartikeya; Tripathi, Aditi; Mukherjee, Suneet; Agnihotri, Namita; Gupta, Gaurav","journal":"Alternative therapies in health and medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412918/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Suresh Gyan Vihar University","SARS"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","India","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Bat SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","nCoV","bat-SL","COVID","respiratory failure","development of existing","new molecules","repurposing antivirals","characteristics of existing human coronaviruses","outbreak","human transmission","plasma infusion","ACE2 receptor","ability","zoonotic coronavirus","time","existence of asymptomatic cases","pediatric cases","study","Researchers","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","relevant literature databases","maximum confirmed cases","genomic sequences of Severe Respiratory Syndrome","literature review","control measures","existence of angiotensin","receptor binding","primary treatment measures","following search terms","dyspnea","Suresh Gyan Vihar University","nasal congestion","pneumonia","Web of Science","School of Pharmacy","invasive lesions","antimalarials","proper ethical laws","CoVZC45","high fever","CNKI","Jaipur","humans","bats","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","EMBASE","possibility","lungs","level treatments","enzyme","features","Chinese Database","intermediate host","careful surveillance","safety","situation","chronic symptoms","Mechanical ventilation","medical guidelines","India","place","PubMed","novel","death","process","people","vaccines","CoVZXC21","clinical trials","undistinguishable similarity","entire world","unpredictable trajectory","days","effectiveness","drugs","strategies","Conclusions","research team","studies","resemblance","learned lessons","areas","speedy action","city of Wuhan","China","incubation period","countries","Context","inclusion","Objective","diseases","Articles"],"language":"en"},

The degree of frailty, resilience and number of co-morbidities caused COVID-19 to present as acute geriatric syndrome events such as falls, delirium and dehydration in these patients. Clinical laboratory results considered typical for COVID-19 were present less often in this frail older population. As in other countries, morbidity and mortality is most severe among frail male patients; therefore, assessment of changes suggestive of typical acute geriatric syndromes in frail older patients with chronic diseases should lead to a careful clinical examination for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS A 55-year old female patient with critical ill COVID-19 was admitted in Taizhou Hospital on January 19, 2020. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 80 mg on the 2nd day after admission. Thereafter, the dose was adjusted in a timely manner and the therapy lasted for 13 days. The peripheral lymphocyte subsets (CD3\u002BT, CD4\u002B T, CD8\u002B T, NK cells, B cells), as well as serum levels of lymphocyte factors (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B3) were dynamically monitored. RESULTS On D1 of admission, the numbers of peripheral blood CD3\u002B T, CD4\u002B T, CD8\u002B T, and NK cells were significantly lower than the normal range. With the improvement of the disease, the numbers of CD3\u002B T, CD8\u002B T and CD4 \u002B T cells gradually recovered and showed a linear growth trend (linear fitting equation: Y=18.59X\u002B109.4, P\u003C0.05).

The technique embeds the discrete channel selection problem into the continuous space of predictor preweighting, then employs a Quasi-Newton (or other) optimization algorithm to optimize the preweighting vector. Once the weighting vector has been optimized, the magnitudes of the weights indicate the relative importance of each channel. The relative importances are used to construct n different models, the kth consisting of the k most important channels. The different models are then compared by means of cross validation or an information criterion (e.g. BIC), allowing automatic selection of a \u0060good\u0027 subset of the channels. The analytical Jacobian of the PLS regression vector with respect to the predictor weighting is derived to facilitate optimization of the latter.

Methods: We used the Koch Institute data on COVID-19 cases in Germany. To minimize the effect of changes in healthcare seeking behavior and testing practices, we included the following 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g among all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period), as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period), and the relative risk RR(g)=PL(g)/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2) is interpreted as the relative increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 for g1 compared to g2 for the later vs. early period. Results: The relative risk was highest for individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR= 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged 25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40-44y (RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45-49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10-14y (RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) among COVID-19 cases is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care/being tested for individuals in those age groups compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, suggesting an actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goldstein, Edward","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e4a1a4ae69d39c54a50457e0e74d534571eedc1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02817v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Koch Institute","RR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["relative risk RR","age group g","prevalence of individuals","year age groups","higher value of RR","pair of age groups g1","role of different age groups","SARS-CoV","g2","observed relative increase","actual increase","early period","later period","proportion PL","detected cases","population incidence of SARS","COVID","weeks","corresponding proportion PE","testing practices","different countries","German population","social distancing practices","lesser adherence","healthcare","behavior","time","Koch Institute data","uncertainty","infections","epidemics","analyses","effect of changes","medical care","Results","Conclusions","likelihood","Methods","Germany","elevated mixing","Background"],"language":"en"},

Since some intermittent events are known to follow a power-law, we investigated the power-law hypothesis in BS by comparing it with alternative functions focusing on flattish periods and developed a new method for detecting BS as an application of statistical model in dogs. Young-adult 6 beagles and senior 6 beagles were anesthetized with sevoflurane 2.0%-5.0% and three of 64 sec EEG (256 Hz) from Fpz-T4 via scalp electrodes were recorded. Three thresholds for peak-to-peak voltage were set: mean value of peak-to-peak voltage at sevoflurane 2.0% in each dog (AS2%), 3mcrV, and 5mcrV. The subthreshold periods were discriminated as $\\tau$ events. We fitted the empirical probability distribution of $\\tau$ by a power-law distribution and an exponential distribution. These two distributions were compared by the normalized log-likelihood ratio test to see which distribution was better fit. At sevoflurane 2.0%-3.0%, by any threshold, the exponential distribution became better fit in all dogs. The power-law distribution became better fit only when BS expressed on EEG. No strict threshold was required for detection of onset of BS. We showed a transition from exponential behavior to power-law behavior on the right tail of $\\tau$ distributions in response to the appearance of suppression waves with increasing anesthetic. This will be a robust tool for BS detection.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koyama, Chika; Haruna, Taichi; Hagihira, Satoshi; Yamashita, Kazuto","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52828cb416511ae274c187e3714605a3c690b30a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06777v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["power-law distribution","exponential distribution","power-law behavior","BS detection","power-law hypothesis","better fit","peak voltage","tau","sevoflurane","empirical probability distribution","exponential behavior","mean value of peak","beagles","sec EEG","distributions","dogs","mcrV","flattish periods","Burst-suppression","detection of onset","subthreshold periods","strict threshold","intermittent events","appearance of suppression waves","indicator of excessive deep anesthesia common","normalized log-likelihood ratio test","response","reliable electroencephalogram","right tail","Fpz-T4","new method","application of statistical model","mammals","increasing anesthetic","Hz","alternative functions","Young-adult","scalp electrodes","robust tool","transition","AS2","thresholds"],"language":"en"},

We introduce a modified epidemic model, the controlled-SIR model, in which the disease reproduction rate evolves dynamically in response to political and societal reactions. An analytic solution is presented. The model reproduces official COVID-19 cases counts of a large number of regions and countries that surpassed the peak of the outbreak. A single unbiased feedback parameter is extracted from field data and used to formulate an index that measures the efficiency of containment policies (the CEI index). CEI values for a range of countries are given. For two variants of the controlled-SIR model, detailed estimates of the total medical and socio-economic costs are evaluated over the entire course of the epidemic. Costs comprise medical care cost, the economic cost of social distancing, as well as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, strict measures fare better than a hands-off policy.

In the field of particles, complete orthogonality is ubiquitous between any two different identical particles, and these complete orthogonality (at the microscopic level) evolves into the partial spectral orthogonality between different species at the mesoscopic level. As a result, we developed SVD to TDSVD so as to reveal the relative amounts of different species in each time interval, and it is the first time that the single solution can be drew from only the TA spectroscopy data without any kinds of a priori information. In the previous articles, \u0027the underdetermination of GTA\u0027 has been addressed prominently, so it is no wonder that researchers are no longer keening to search the method for mathematically analyzing the TR-data in order to derive the single solution. However, TDSVD will offset the deficiency of being underdetermined in GTA and becomes an effectively autonomous method towards two-dimensional data analysis. Mathematically, as long as there is enough orthogonality between any two \u0027species\u0027 in any data matrix, the yield of the single solution is no longer a problem.

We take on this task by converting the symptom onset time distribution, which we calibrated, into the percentage of the latent, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic groups through a novel mathematical procedure. We then estimate the reduction of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ under specific disease control practices such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing masks and staying at home. When these measures are implemented in parallel, their effects on $R_0$ multiply. For example, if 70% of the general public wear masks and contact tracing is conducted at 60% efficiency within a 4-day time frame, epidemic growth will be flattened in the hardest hit countries. Finally, we analyze the bell-shaped curves of epidemic evolution from various affected regions and point out the significance of a universal decay rate of -0.32/day in the final eradication of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Liang; Li, Xuefei; Qi, Fei; Tang, Qian-Yuan; Tang, Viola; Liu, Jiang; Li, Zhiyuan; Cheng, Xingye; Li, Xuanxuan; Shi, Yingchen; Liu, Haiguang; Tang, Lei-Han","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41cff7b2e3a694592f4f9b3ae28953999a2e8a74.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07353v4.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact tracing","day time frame","symptomatic groups","epidemic growth","infected population","bell-shaped curves of epidemic evolution","general public wear masks","symptom onset time distribution","specific disease control practices","outbreak","regards","various affected regions","significance","continuous census","testing","viral carriers","novel mathematical procedure","severe symptoms","basic reproduction number","social distancing","universal decay rate","Swift government response","reduction","task","percentage","final eradication","efficiency","hardest hit countries","effects","measures","home","COVID","people","deaths","example"],"language":"en"},

Despite this vogue, the security vulnerabilities of MLPUs remain mostly unknown. Aim: To address this concern, we conduct a study to understand the test time security vulnerabilities of the state-of-the-art MLPU systems, aiming at providing guidelines for the future development of these systems. Method: In this paper, we propose an evasion attack framework against MLPU systems. To achieve this, we first develop an algorithm to generate adversarial phishing URLs. We then reproduce 41 MLPU systems and record their baseline performance. Finally, we simulate an evasion attack to evaluate these MLPU systems against our generated adversarial URLs. Results: In comparison to previous works, our attack is: (i) effective as it evades all the models with an average success rate of 66% and 85% for famous (such as Netflix, Google) and less popular phishing targets (e.g., Wish, JBHIFI, Officeworks) respectively; (ii) realistic as it requires only 23ms to produce a new adversarial URL variant that is available for registration with a median cost of only $11.99/year. We also found that popular online services such as Google SafeBrowsing and VirusTotal are unable to detect these URLs. (iii) We find that Adversarial training (successful defence against evasion attack) does not significantly improve the robustness of these systems as it decreases the success rate of our attack by only 6% on average for all the models. (iv) Further, we identify the security vulnerabilities of the considered MLPU systems. Our findings lead to promising directions for future research. Conclusion: Our study not only illustrate vulnerabilities in MLPU systems but also highlights implications for future study towards assessing and improving these systems.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sabir, Bushra; Babar, M.

Data time horizon ranges from 26 February 20020, which is the date when the first case not directly connected with China has been discovered in northern Italy, to 18 March 2020. An endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the phenomenon. Previous literature has shown that these class of models provide reliable predictions of infectious diseases in time and space. Three subcomponents characterize the estimated model. The first is related to the evolution of the disease over time; the second is characterized by transmission of the illness among inhabitants of the same province; the third remarks the effects of spatial neighbourhood and try to capture the contagion effects of nearby areas. Focusing on the aggregated time-series of the daily counts in Italy, the contribution of any of the three subcomponents do not dominate on the others and our predictions are excellent for the whole country, with an error of 3 per thousand compared to the late available data. At local level, instead, interesting distinct patterns emerge. In particular, the provinces first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, for the provinces the are currently strongly affected by contagions, the component accounting for the spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent. Moreover, the proposed model provides good forecasts of the number of infections at local level while controlling for delayed reporting.","publish_time":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giuliani, Diego; Dickson, Maria Michela; Espa, Giuseppe; Santi, Flavio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e112de47dc1b3af7841057fbc398e8f24a2f1eb5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06664v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["local level","effects of spatial neighbourhood","effects of spatial neighbours","aggregated time-series","spatial interaction","linear model","Data time horizon ranges","proposed model","estimated model","finest possible level of spatial areal aggregation","number of infections","areal disease counts","endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series","contagion effects of nearby areas","late available data","Italian provinces","subcomponents","spatio-temporal diffusion","number of infected","daily counts","surrounding areas","spatio-temporal distribution of COVID","northern Italy","reliable predictions of infectious diseases","class of models","good forecasts","component accounting","thousand","contribution","remarks","interesting distinct patterns","illness","inhabitants","China","country","phenomenon","space","delayed reporting","case","transmission","Previous literature","error","contagions","containment measures","evolution","date","hand"],"language":"en"},

Several African countries, especially South Africa, have already taken strong non-pharmaceutical interventions that include physical distancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced human mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of such interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing interests in most African countries: strongly limited health care capacities and testing capabilities largely conflict with pressured national economies and socio-economic hardships on the individual level, limiting compliance to intervention targets. Here we investigate implications of interventions on the COVID-19 outbreak dynamics, focusing on South Africa before and after the national lockdown enacted on March 27, 2020. Our analysis shows that initial exponential growth of existing case numbers is consistent with doubling times of about $2.5$ days. After lockdown, the growth remains exponential, now with doubling times of 18 days, but still in contrast to subexponential growth reported for Hubei/China after lockdown. Moreover, a scenario analysis of a computational data-driven agent based mobility model for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (with $1.14$ million inhabitants) hints that keeping current levels of intervention measures and compliance until the end of April is of insufficient length and still too weak, too unspecific or too inconsistently complied with to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring, slightly stronger, more specific interventions combined with sufficient compliance may constitute a viable option for interventions for regions in South Africa and potentially for large parts of the African continent.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schroder, Malte; Bossert, Andreas; Kersting, Moritz; Aeffner, Sebastian; Coetzee, Justin; Timme, Marc; Schluter, Jan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd5d56f9860dabbcb9d1ef512d8009255db7200e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12319v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nelson Mandela"],"organizations":["Hubei/China"],"locations":["South Africa","Sub-Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["African countries","South Africa reporting","specific interventions","implications of interventions","African continent","national lockdown","Sub-Saharan Africa","sufficient compliance","strong non-pharmaceutical interventions","subexponential growth","doubling times","COVID","days","initial exponential growth of existing case numbers","mobility model","intervention targets","scenario analysis","human mobility options","pressured national economies","limited health care capacities","current levels of intervention measures","local intensive care capacity","testing capabilities","physical distancing","leisure activities","computational data-driven agent","socio-economic hardships","individual level","viable option","Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality","end","Hubei","large parts","regions","outbreak dynamics","inhabitants","hints","cases","overall effectiveness","contrast","China","required strengths","insufficient length","interests"],"language":"en"},

We demonstrate that discontinuity-preserving denoising can be achieved even with quadratic data and smoothness terms, provided that the coupling term involves the $L^1$ norm. We show that such an $L^1$ coupling term provides additional information as a powerful edge detector that has remained unexplored so far. While coupling models in the literature approximate higher order regularisation, we argue that already first order coupling models can be useful. As a specific example, we present a first order coupling model that outperforms classical TV regularisation. It also establishes a theoretical connection between TV regularisation and the Mumford-Shah segmentation approach. Unlike other Mumford-Shah algorithms, it is a strictly convex approximation, for which we can guarantee convergence of a split Bregman algorithm.","publish_time":"2019-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wewior, Aaron; Weickert, Joachim","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b17f8546c3e05d208dd9170c861a534f2eb4a9b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05888v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bregman"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["order coupling models","coupling terms","Variational models","classical TV regularisation","literature approximate higher order regularisation","Mumford-Shah algorithms","smoothness terms","Mumford-Shah segmentation approach","energy minimisation splits","multiple fractional steps","powerful edge detector","additional information","quadratic data","theoretical connection","number of interesting properties","convergence","split Bregman algorithm","auxiliary variables","image analysis","obvious numerical benefits","denoising","convex approximation","specific example","discontinuity","paper","norm"],"language":"en"},

We propose a model which predicts an asymptotically self-similar expansion of deaths in time before containment, and the final death toll under total containment measures, as a function of the delay in taking those measures after the expansion is observed. The physics of the model resembles the expansion of a flame in a homogeneous domain with a fractal dimension 3.75. After containment measures are taken, the natural fractal structure of the network is drastically altered and a secondary evolution is observed. This evolution, akin to the homogeneous combustion in a static isolated enclosure with a final quenching, has a characteristic time of 20.1 days, according to available data of the pandemic behavior in China. The proposed model is remarkably consistent with available data, which supports the simplifying hypotheses made in the model. A universal formulation for a quarantine as a function of that delay is also proposed.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ganan-Calvo, Alfonso M.; Ramos, Juan A.

Here we show that reductions in mobility across U.S. counties with at least 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 led to reductions in fever incidences, as captured by smart thermometers, after a mean lag of 6.5 days ($90\\%$ within 3--10 days) that is consistent with the incubation period of COVID-19.

There are two directions of exploration. One is to study networks existing in the language system. Various lexical networks can be built based on different relationships between words, being semantic or syntactic. Recent studies have shown that these lexical networks exhibit small-world and scale-free features. The other direction of exploration is to study networks of language users (i.e. social networks of people in the linguistic community), and their role in language evolution. Social networks also show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by random or regular network models. In the past, computational models of language change and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or regular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures may affect the dynamics. In the second part of the paper, a series of simulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate the importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for modeling language change. Four types of social networks are compared, which exhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics. While the questions about which type of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some preliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.","publish_time":"2007-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jinyun, KE","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0b389ae96ef0f13c7f1090e4e65e4fdfdb6e268.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0701135v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["networks of language users","type of social networks","social networks of people","types of social networks","Various lexical networks","modeling language change","language emergence","language evolution","language system","computational models of language change","regular network models","small-world","network structures","scale-free features","regular structure","paper","series of simulation models of diffusion","categories of diffusion dynamics","light of recent development of network theories","realistic conditions of population structure","linguistic innovation","linguistic community","Recent studies","direction of exploration","directions of exploration","words","importance","role","past","different relationships","little discussion","human languages","preliminary suggestions","questions"],"language":"en"},

The models are denoted SIR-$\\omega$ and SEIR-$\\omega$, and we focus attention on the early stages of an outbreak, where we derive expression for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the expected degree of the infectious nodes $E(D_I)$ using two different approximation approaches. The first approach approximates the early spread of an epidemic by a branching process, whereas the second one uses pair approximation. The expressions are compared with the corresponding empirical means obtained from stochastic simulations of SIR-$\\omega$ and SEIR-$\\omega$ epidemics on Poisson and scale-free networks. Without rewiring of exposed nodes, the two approaches predict the same epidemic threshold and the same $E(D_I)$ for both types of epidemics, the latter being very close to the mean degree obtained from simulated epidemics over Poisson networks. Above the epidemic threshold, pairwise models overestimate the value of $R_0$ computed from simulations, which turns out to be very close to the one predicted by the branching process approximation. When exposed individuals also rewire with $\\alpha\u003E0$ (perhaps unaware of being infected), the two approaches give different epidemic thresholds, with the branching process approximation being more in agreement with simulations.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Britton, Tom; Juher, David; Saldana, Joan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0463899a5551499a7f54817467056dafcf4abc5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00344v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["omega","SEIR epidemic models","branching process approximation","different approximation approaches","alpha","stochastic simulations of SIR","different epidemic thresholds","stochastic SIR","Poisson networks","pair approximation","simulated epidemics","random networks","denoted SIR","types of epidemics","susceptible individuals","exposed nodes","scale-free networks","expected degree","mean degree","infectious nodes","early spread","early stages","infected neighbors","so-called preventive rewiring","corresponding empirical means","basic reproduction number","agreement","outbreak","probability","attention","rate","value","expressions","paper","edge"],"language":"en"},

Finally, we discuss why the estimates obtained need to be interpreted with care.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hotz, Thomas; Glock, Matthias; Heyder, Stefan; Semper, Sebastian; Bohle, Anne; Kramer, Alexander","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a13e4281bfa79cbc37a00c3aa8e5ba4b3ff435c0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08557v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["updated estimates","estimator","simulated data","real data lead","plausible results","Coronavirus Disease","constant monitoring","reproduction number","details","current outbreak","time","asymptotic properties","sensitivity analysis","vaccines","antiviral drugs","epidemic","need","care","implementation","Fraser","document"],"language":"en"},

The course of viral infections in patients with acute bronchitis, asthma and COPD can be improved by oral application of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract; however, the mechanism is not well understood. This study investigated the in vitro effect of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract (EPs 7630) on the expression of virus binding cell membrane and host defence supporting proteins on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEC). Cells were isolated from patients with severe asthma (n = 6), moderate COPD (n = 6) and non-diseased controls (n = 6). Protein expression was determined by Western-blot and immunofluorescence. Rhinovirus infection was determined by immunofluorescence as well as by polymerase chain reaction. Cell survival was determined by manual cell count after live/death immunofluorescence staining. All parameters were determined over a period of 3 days. The results show that EPs 7630 concentration-dependently and significantly increased hBEC survival after rhinovirus infection. This effect was paralleled by decreased expression of the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), its ligand ICOSL and cell surface calreticulin (C1qR). In contrast, EPs 7630 up-regulated the expression of the host defence supporting proteins \u03B2-defensin-1 and SOCS-1, both in rhinovirus infected and un-infected hBEC. The expression of other virus interacting cell membrane proteins such as MyD88, TRL2/4 or ICAM-1 was not altered by EPs 7630. The results indicate that EPs 7630 may reduce rhinovirus infection of human primary BEC by down-regulating cell membrane docking proteins and up-regulating host defence proteins.","publish_time":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roth, Michael; Fang, Lei; Stolz, Daiana; Tamm, Michael","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c21db27b83fa2b5d4c1b0739b99e53c83e0430c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6358071.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6358071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pelargonium"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell membrane proteins","EPs","Cell survival","target cell","cell membrane docking proteins","host defence proteins","expression of virus binding cell membrane","rhinovirus infected","manual cell count","cell surface calreticulin","Protein expression","rhinovirus infection of human primary BEC","proteins \u03B2-defensin","primary human bronchial epithelial cells","patients","effect of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract","increased hBEC survival","un-infected hBEC","results","oral application of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract","death immunofluorescence staining","moderate COPD","severe asthma","ligand ICOSL","acute bronchitis","MyD88","course of viral infections","inducible co-stimulator","C1qR","TRL2","concentration","non-diseased controls","Western-blot","SOCS","polymerase chain reaction","period","ICAM","study","mechanism","parameters","days","contrast"],"language":"en"},

A total of 37 children (62 days-12 years [median 5.5 years]) were included in this study. Pneumocystis was diagnosed by microscopy using Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain in 12 cases and by nested PCR using mtLSUrRNA in 25 cases. Genotyping was performed using three different genes, mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSUrRNA), dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). mtLSUrRNA genotype 3 and novel mutations at the gene target DHFR (401 T \u003E C) and DHPS 96/98 were frequently observed and clinically associated with severe PCP and treatment failure.

In conclusion, the present study strongly suggests the emergence of virulent P. jirovecii strains or genetic polymorphisms, leading to treatment failure and high mortality. Our study is the first of its kind from the Indian subcontinent and has highlighted the genetic diversity of Pneumocystis jirovecii among children and their clinical outcomes.

This raises the possibility of APOBEC3 inhibition as a strategy for augmenting existing antiviral and anticancer therapies.

Multiple experimental approaches, including isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence polarization, protein thermal shift, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy assays, demonstrate nanomolar dissociation constants and low micromolar inhibition constants.

This study presents a new deterministic model for assessing the population-level impact of the quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to disease on the spread of the 2014\u20132015 outbreaks of Ebola viral disease. It is assumed that quarantine is imperfect (i.e., individuals can acquire infection during quarantine). In the absence of quarantine, the model is shown to exhibit global dynamics with respect to the disease-free and its unique endemic equilibrium when a certain epidemiological threshold (denoted by [Formula: see text]) is either less than or greater than unity. Thus, unlike the full model with imperfect quarantine (which is known to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation), the version of the model with no quarantine does not undergo a backward bifurcation. Using data relevant to the 2014\u20132015 Ebola transmission dynamics in the three West African countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), uncertainty analysis of the model show that, although the current level and effectiveness of quarantine can lead to significant reduction in disease burden, they fail to bring the associated quarantine reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) to a value less than unity (which is needed to make effective disease control or elimination feasible). This reduction of [Formula: see text] is, however, very possible with a modest increase in quarantine rate and effectiveness. It is further shown, via sensitivity analysis, that the parameters related to the effectiveness of quarantine (namely the parameter associated with the reduction in infectiousness of infected quarantined individuals and the contact rate during quarantine) are the main drivers of the disease transmission dynamics. Overall, this study shows that the singular implementation of a quarantine intervention strategy can lead to the effective control or elimination of Ebola viral disease in a community if its coverage and effectiveness levels are high enough.","publish_time":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00E9nes, Attila; Gumel, Abba B.","journal":"Infect Dis Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab9abbe85c17fc97b9b10fefa729dae44c12c65d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6382747.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6382747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Liberia"],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of quarantine","quarantine of individuals","quarantine rate","imperfect quarantine","absence of quarantine","quarantine of people","quarantine intervention strategy","associated quarantine reproduction number","disease transmission dynamics","disease burden","effective disease control","elimination of Ebola viral disease","outbreaks of Ebola viral disease","Formula","text","Ebola transmission dynamics","effectiveness levels","new deterministic model","effective control","global dynamics","significant reduction","study","phenomenon of backward bifurcation","infectiousness of infected quarantined individuals","contact rate","elimination feasible","current level","uncertainty analysis","sensitivity analysis","population-level impact","spread of communicable diseases","Liberia","West African countries","unique endemic equilibrium","Guinea","community","Sierra Leone","certain epidemiological threshold","main drivers","singular implementation","coverage","modest increase","human communities","respect","parameters","version","basic public health measure","value","infection","infectious agent","data relevant"],"language":"en"},

The primary outcome was that transmission occurred approximately one day prior to development of visible signs of disease (posterior median 21 hours, 95% CI: 1.1\u201345.0). Updated disease state durations were incorporated into a simulation model to examine the importance of addressing preclinical transmission in the face of robust response measures. Simulation of FMD outbreaks in the US pig production sector demonstrated that including a preclinical infectious period of one day would result in a 40% increase in the median number of farms affected (166 additional farms and 664,912 pigs euthanized) compared to the scenario of no preclinical transmission, assuming suboptimal outbreak response. These findings emphasize the importance of considering transmission of FMD during the incubation phase in modeling and response planning.","publish_time":"2019-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arzt, Jonathan; Branan, Matthew A.; Delgado, Amy H.; Yadav, Shankar; Moreno-Torres, Karla I.; Tildesley, Michael J.; Stenfeldt, Carolina","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac69a2badb02e616a06006df17c79d5d41bb9a33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6389902.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389902/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMD"],"locations":["US"],"keyphrases":["preclinical transmission","transmission of FMD","occurrence of transmission","unique experimental transmission study","incubation phase","Simulation of FMD outbreaks","mouth disease","response planning","day","importance","median number of farms","preclinical infectious period","suboptimal outbreak response","development of visible signs of disease","posterior median","Updated disease state durations","face of robust response measures","additional farms","simulation model","Bayesian modeling approach","group-housed pigs","US pig production sector","current investigation","hours","foot","increase","scenario","CI","primary outcome","findings"],"language":"en"},

A significant number of people chronically infected with HCV develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of hepatocyte damage associated with chronic HCV infection are not fully understood yet, mainly due to the lack of an in vitro system able to recapitulate the stages of infection in vivo. Several studies underline that HCV virus replication depends on redox-sensitive cellular pathways; in addition, it is known that virus itself induces alterations of the cellular redox state. However, the exact interplay between HCV replication and oxidative stress has not been elucidated. In particular, the role of reduced glutathione (GSH) in HCV replication and infection is still not clear. We set up an in vitro system, based on low m.o.i. of Huh7.5 cell line with a HCV infectious clone (J6/JFH1), that reproduced the acute and persistent phases of HCV infection up to 76 days of culture. We demonstrated that the acute phase of HCV infection is characterized by the elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated in part with an increase of NADPH-oxidase transcripts and activity and a depletion of GSH accompanied by high rates of viral replication and apoptotic cell death. Conversely, the chronic phase is characterized by a reestablishment of reduced environment due to a decreased ROS production and increased GSH content in infected cells that might concur to the establishment of viral persistence. Treatment with the prooxidant auranofin of the persistently infected cultures induced the increase of viral RNA titer, suggesting that a prooxidant state could favor the reactivation of HCV viral replication that in turn caused cell damage and death. Our results suggest that targeting the redox-sensitive host-cells pathways essential for viral replication and/or persistence may represent a promising option for contrasting HCV infection.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anticoli, Simona; Amatore, Donatella; Matarrese, Paola; De Angelis, Marta; Palamara, Anna Teresa; Nencioni, Lucia; Ruggieri, Anna","journal":"Oxid Med Cell Longev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee92720c10a0cb395a8c1fd940dc0d12c44577f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6393922.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6393922/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","GSH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV replication","HCV virus replication","chronic HCV infection","contrasting HCV infection","reactivation of HCV viral replication","acute phase of HCV infection","persistent phases of HCV infection","HCV infectious clone","stages of infection","high rates of viral replication","establishment of viral persistence","cell damage","infected cells","chronic hepatitis","chronic phase","cellular redox state","redox-sensitive cellular pathways","increase of viral RNA titer","depletion of GSH","cell line","apoptotic cell death","infected cultures","prooxidant state","Hepatitis C virus","redox-sensitive host-cells pathways essential","increased GSH content","increase of NADPH","prooxidant auranofin","system able","decreased ROS production","role of reduced glutathione","reestablishment of reduced environment","pathophysiologic mechanisms of hepatocyte damage","turn","elevated levels of reactive oxygen species","oxidase transcripts","activity","JFH1","promising option","exact interplay","oxidative stress","cirrhosis","J6","pathogen","addition","alterations","blood","Huh7","significant number of people","studies","liver cancer","days of culture","lack","Treatment","results"],"language":"en"},

Mycobacteria spp., however, are well known for their numerous immune evasion mechanisms that limit the true potential of their therapeutic use. One such major mechanism is the induction of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which mitigates adaptive immune responses. Here, we sought to unravel the molecular pathways behind PD-L1 up-regulation on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by BCG. We found that infection of APCs with BCG induced PD-L1 up-regulation, but that this did not depend on direct infection, suggesting a soluble mediator for this effect. BCG induced potent quantities of IL-6 and IL-10, and the downstream transcription factor STAT3 was hyper-phosphorylated. Intracellular analyses revealed that levels of PD-L1 molecules were associated with the STAT3 phosphorylation state, suggesting a causal link. Neutralisation of the IL-6 or IL-10 cytokine receptors dampened STAT3 phosphorylation and BCG-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1 on APCs. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 achieved the same effect, confirming an autocrine-paracrine cytokine loop as a mechanism for BCG-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1. Finally, an in vivo immunisation model showed that BCG vaccination under PD-L1 blockade could enhance antigen-specific memory CD4 T-cell responses. These novel findings could lead to refinement of BCG as both a vaccine for infectious disease and as a cancer immunotherapy.","publish_time":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Copland, Alastair; Sparrow, Adam; Hart, Peter; Diogo, Gil Reynolds; Paul, Mathew; Azuma, Miyuki; Reljic, Rajko","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e545cfc731b5511fe89ef69e6d09cbc9bf428704.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6403281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6403281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCG induced PD-L1","regulation of PD","PD-L1 blockade","BCG vaccination","refinement of BCG","levels of PD","L1 molecules","infection of APCs","STAT3 phosphorylation state","Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3","potent quantities of IL","effect","cancer immunotherapy","downstream transcription factor STAT3","adaptive immune responses","cytokine receptors","licensed vaccine","major mechanism","direct infection","bladder cancer","antigen-specific memory CD4 T-cell responses","autocrine-paracrine cytokine loop","numerous immune evasion mechanisms","true potential","induction of programmed death ligand","malignancies","infectious disease","soluble mediator","cells","causal link","immunisation model","therapeutic use","tuberculosis","TB","Intracellular analyses","Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00E9rin","molecular pathways","novel findings","immunostimulatory properties","Neutralisation","Mycobacteria"],"language":"en"},

Most Ad-based therapies utilize species C serotypes, with Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) most commonly employed. Prior clinical trials demonstrated low efficiency of oncolytic Ad5 vectors, mainly due to the absence of Ad5 primary receptor (Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor, CAR) on cancer cells. Engineering serotype chimeric vectors (Ad5/3) to utilize Adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) receptors has greatly improved their oncolytic potential. Clinical translation of these infectivity-enhanced vectors has been challenging due to a lack of replication permissive animal models. In this study, we explored pigs as a model to study the performance of fiber-modified Ad5/3 chimeric vectors. As a control, the Ad5 fiber-unmodified virus was used. We analyzed binding, gene transfer, replication, and cytolytic ability of Ad5 and Ad5/3 in various non-human cell lines (murine, hamster, canine, porcine). Among all tested cell lines only porcine cells supported active binding and replication of Ad5/3. Syrian hamster cells supported Ad5 replication but showed no evidence of productive viral replication after infection with Ad5/3 vectors. Transduction and replication ability of Ad5/3 in porcine cells outperformed Ad5, a phenomenon often observed in human cancer cell lines. Replication of Ad5 and Ad5/3 was subsequently evaluated in vivo in immunocompetent pigs. Quantitative PCR analyses 7 days post infection revealed Ad5 and Ad5/3 DNA and replication-dependent luciferase activity in the swine lungs and spleen indicating active replication in these tissues. These studies demonstrated the flaws in using Syrian hamsters for testing serotype chimeric Ad5/3 vectors. This is the first report to validate the pig as a valuable model for preclinical testing of oncolytic adenoviruses utilizing Adenovirus type 3 receptors. We hope that these data will help to foster the clinical translation of oncolytic adenoviruses including those with Ad3 retargeted tropism.","publish_time":"2019-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koodie, Lisa; Robertson, Matthew G.; Chandrashekar, Malavika; Ruth, George; Dunning, Michele; Bianco, Richard W.; Davydova, Julia","journal":"Cancers (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ca680635b3f3dcf21ea32eca2ef05b3ef44d3ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6406826.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of Ad5","Ad5 replication","replication ability of Ad5","modified Ad5","cytolytic ability of Ad5","testing serotype chimeric Ad5","low efficiency of oncolytic Ad5 vectors","active replication","absence of Ad5 primary receptor","Ad5 fiber-unmodified virus","Adenovirus type","porcine cells","cancer cells","clinical translation of oncolytic adenoviruses","Adenovirus Receptor","replication-dependent luciferase activity","evidence of productive viral replication","oncolytic potential","Engineering serotype chimeric vectors","preclinical testing of oncolytic adenoviruses","human cancer cell lines","Syrian hamster cells","infectivity-enhanced vectors","lack of replication permissive animal models","tested cell lines","various non-human cell lines","active binding","receptors","cancer therapeutics","study","Prior clinical trials","Syrian hamsters","valuable model","performance of fiber","immunocompetent pigs","days post infection","Ad-based therapies","Ad3 retargeted tropism","swine lungs","Coxsackie","species C serotypes","spleen","DNA","phenomenon","promising tools","Quantitative PCR analyses","CAR","gene transfer","flaws","canine","tissues","control","Transduction","studies","report","data"],"language":"en"},

AIM: We aimed to investigate influenza C virus circulation in Germany. METHODS: A total of 1,588 samples from 0 to 4 year-old children presenting as outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection were analysed retrospectively. The samples represented a subset of all samples from the German national surveillance system for influenza in this age group in 2012\u201314. The presence of influenza C virus was investigated by real-time PCR. For positive samples, information on symptoms as well as other respiratory virus co-infections was considered. Retrieved influenza C viral sequences were phylogenetically characterised. RESULTS: Influenza C viral RNA was detected in 20 (1.3% of) samples, including 16 during the 2012/13 season. The majority (18/20) of influenza C-positive patients had ILI according to the European Union definition, one patient had pneumonia. Viruses belonged to the C/Sao Paulo and C/Kanagawa lineages. Most (11/20) samples were co-infected with other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION: Our data are the first on influenza C virus circulation in Germany and notably from a European national surveillance system. The low detection frequency and the identified virus variants confirm earlier observations outside a surveillance system. More virus detections during the 2012/13 season indicate a variable circulation intensity in the different years studied. Influenza C virus can be considered for ILI patients.

The ability to initiate a rapid bacterial dissemination is a characteristic hallmark of Y. pestis infection. A distinguishing characteristic between the two Yersinia species is that Y. pseudotuberculosis strains possess an O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) while Y. pestis has lost the O-antigen during evolution and therefore exposes its core LPS. In this study, we showed that Y. pestis utilizes its core LPS to interact with SIGNR1 (CD209b), a C-type lectin receptor on antigen presenting cells (APCs), leading to bacterial dissemination to lymph nodes, spleen and liver, and the initiation of a systemic infection. We therefore propose that the loss of O-antigen represents a critical step in the evolution of Y. pseudotuberculosis into Y. pestis in terms of hijacking APCs, promoting bacterial dissemination and causing the plague.","publish_time":"2019-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Kun; He, Yingxia; Park, Chae Gyu; Kang, Young Sun; Zhang, Pei; Han, Yanping; Cui, Yujun; Bulgheresi, Silvia; Anisimov, Andrey P.; Dentovskaya, Svetlana V.; Ying, Xiaoling; Jiang, Lingyu; Ding, Honghui; Njiri, Olivia Adhiambo; Zhang, Shusheng; Zheng, Guoxing; Xia, Lianxu; Kan, Biao; Wang, Xin; Jing, Huaiqi; Yan, Meiying; Li, Wei; Wang, Yuanzhi; Xiamu, Xiding; Chen, Gang; Ma, Ding; Bartra, Sara Schesser; Plano, Gregory V.; Klena, John D.; Yang, Ruifu; Skurnik, Mikael; Chen, Tie","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d44adb48335ef12290b3584771b424aa28185e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6422942.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6422942/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Yersinia pestis","pestis infection","O-antigen","Yersinia pseudotuberculosis","pseudotuberculosis strains","core LPS","rapid bacterial dissemination","Yersinia species","evolution of","loss of O","characteristic hallmark of","distinguishing characteristic","systemic infection","terms of hijacking APCs","etiologic agent of plague","spleen","C-type lectin receptor","Gram-negative bacterium","cells","lymph nodes","cause","critical step","liver","initiation","CD209b","SIGNR1","lipopolysaccharide","mild enteric disease","biological mechanisms","ability","virulent pathogen","study"],"language":"en"},

The present study aimed to conduct a contact survey in Japan, offering estimates of contact by age and location and validating a social contact matrix using a seroepidemiological dataset of influenza. METHODS: An internet-based questionnaire survey was conducted, covering all 47 prefectures in Japan and including a total of 1476 households. The social contact matrix was quantified assuming reciprocity and using the maximum likelihood method. By imposing several parametric assumptions for the next-generation matrix, the empirical seroepidemiological data of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 was analysed and we estimated the basic reproduction number, R(0). RESULTS: In total, the reported number of contacts on weekdays was 10,682 whereas that on weekend days was 8867. Strong age-dependent assortativity was identified. Forty percent of weekday contacts took place at schools or workplaces, but that declined to 14% on weekends. Accounting for the age-dependent heterogeneity with the known social contact matrix, the minimum value of the Akaike information criterion was obtained and R(0) was estimated at 1.45 (95% confidence interval: 1.42, 1.49). CONCLUSIONS: Survey datasets will be useful for parameterizing the heterogeneous transmission model of various directly transmitted infectious diseases in Japan. Age-dependent assortativity, especially among children, along with numerous contacts in school settings on weekdays implies the potential effectiveness of school closure.

However, pIFN-\u03B3 is a secretory protein that has a short half-life in organisms and is easily inactivated, making it difficult to apply widely in clinics. Therefore, we tried to optimize the expression of pIFN-\u03B3 in Pichia pastoris to obtain a large amount of highly active, easily purified pIFN-\u03B3 protein in vitro. Through C-terminal sequence analysis, we found a signal sequence (EKREAEAE) that was easily enzymolysed by a signal peptide enzyme, resulting in degradation and inactivation of the pIFN-\u03B3 protein. In this study, we optimized the pIFN-\u03B3 gene recombination sequence and mutated the 3\u0027 end of the pIFN-\u03B3 gene, resulting in a higher expression level and stronger biological activity, as well as a significant upregulation in the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes Mx1 and OAS1 in IPEC-J2 jejunal epithelial cells.

A recombinant Pichia pastoris strain with the optimized pIFN-\u03B3 gene could obtain a high yield of pIFN-\u03B3 protein, up to 9536 mg/L, after staged incubation for 0\u201324 h at 28\u00B0C, pH 6.0, and 50% dissolved oxygen (DO), followed by incubation for 24\u201372 h at 25\u00B0C, pH 6.0 and 30% DO. These data demonstrated, for the first time, that the expression level of pIFN-\u03B3 in Pichia pastoris was improved significantly by gene optimization with 3\u0027 end mutation and a fermentation process that maintained good biological activity, which is beneficial to the application of pIFN-\u03B3 in animal husbandry.","publish_time":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Haiming; Deng, Jinbo; Li, Jiaoqing; Ma, Miaopeng; Huang, Chaoyuan; Zhao, Peijing; Ming, Feiping; Liang, Qianyi; Jia, Junhao; Zhang, Shuxia; Zeng, Min; Zhang, Linghua","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07d21c31ad4f63f607760d66db2b6124562f8838.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6435167.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6435167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pIFN-\u03B3 protein","expression of pIFN","optimized pIFN-\u03B3 gene","pIFN-\u03B3 gene recombination sequence","application of pIFN","expression level of pIFN","high yield of pIFN","gene optimization","signal sequence","secretory protein","higher expression level","NK cells","T cells","good biological activity","stronger biological activity","recombinant Pichia pastoris strain","fermentation process","C-terminal sequence analysis","pH","data","incubation","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","end mutation","IPEC-J2 jejunal epithelial cells","Porcine gamma interferon","signal peptide enzyme","interferon-stimulated genes Mx1","OAS1","cytokine","degradation","inactivation","immunomodulatory function","short half-life","animal husbandry","significant upregulation","time","organisms","productivity","EKREAEAE","dissolved oxygen","clinics","study"],"language":"en"},

This incremental success mainly reflects the complexity of SCI pathophysiology and the diverse biochemical and physiological changes that occur in the injured spinal cord. Therefore, in the past few decades, considerable efforts have been made by SCI researchers to elucidate the pathophysiology of SCI and unravel the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of tissue degeneration and repair in the injured spinal cord. To this end, a number of preclinical animal and injury models have been developed to more closely recapitulate the primary and secondary injury processes of SCI. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of SCI.

In order to isolate RV-Cs from clinical specimens and gain a better understanding of their biological properties and pathogenesis, we established air\u2013liquid-interface (ALI) culture methods using HBEC3-KT and HSAEC1-KT immortalized human airway epithelial cells. HBEC3- and HSAEC1-ALI cultures morphologically resembled pseudostratified epithelia with cilia and goblet cells. Two fully sequenced clinical RV-C isolates, RV-C9 and -C53, were propagated in HBEC3-ALI cultures, and increases in viral RNA ranging from 1.71 log(10) to 7.06 log(10) copies were observed. However, this propagation did not occur in HSAEC1-ALI cultures. Using the HBEC3-ALI culture system, 11 clinical strains of RV-C were isolated from 23 clinical specimens, and of them, nine were passaged and re-propagated. The 11 clinical isolates were classified as RV-C2, -C6, -C9, -C12, -C18, -C23, -C40, and -C53 types according to their VP1 sequences. Our stable HBEC3-ALI culture system is the first cultivable cell model that supports the growth of multiple RV-C virus types from clinical specimens.

The timing and underlying mechanisms of ASM transition from a phasic to a tonic contractile phenotype are yet to be established. We characterized phasic ASM contraction in preterm (128 day gestation), term (\u223C150 day gestation), 1\u20134 month, 1 yr, and adult sheep (5yr). Spontaneous phasic activity was measured in bronchial segments as amplitude, frequency, and intensity. The mechanism of phasic ASM contraction was investigated further with a computational model of ASM force development and lumen narrowing. The computational model comprised a two-dimensional cylindrical geometry of a network of contractile units and the activation of neighboring cells was dependent on the strength of coupling between cells. As expected, phasic contractions were most prominent in fetal airways and decreased with advancing age, to a level similar to the level in the 1\u20134 month lambs. Computational predictions demonstrated phasic contraction through the generation of a wave of activation events, the magnitude of which is determined by the number of active cells and the strength of cell\u2013cell interactions. Decreases in phasic contraction with advancing age were simulated by reducing cell\u2013cell coupling. Results show that phasic activity is suppressed rapidly after birth, then sustained at a lower intensity from the preweaning phase until adulthood in an ovine developmental model. Cell\u2013cell coupling is proposed as a key determinant of phasic ASM contraction and if reduced could explain the observed maturational changes.","publish_time":"2019-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Kimberley C.

Clinical studies have shown that early treatments of RSV patients with ribavirin improve prognosis, even if the use of this drug is limited due to myelosuppression and toxicity effects. Furthermore, effective vaccines to prevent RSV infection are currently unavailable. Thus, the development of highly effective and specific antiviral drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of RSV infections is a compelling need. In the quest of new RSV inhibitors, in this work we evaluated the antiviral activity of a series of variously substituted 5,6-dichloro-1-phenyl-1(2)H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole derivatives in cell-based assays. Several 1- and 2-phenyl-benzotriazoles resulted fairly potent (\u03BCM concentrations) inhibitors of RSV infection in plaque reduction assays, accompanied by low cytotoxicity in human highly dividing T lymphoid-derived cells and primary cell lines. Contextually, no inhibitory effects were observed against other RNA or DNA viruses assayed, suggesting specific activity against RSV. Further results revealed that the lead compound 10d was active during the early phase of the RSV infection cycle. To understand whether 10d interfered with virus attachment to target cells or virus-cell fusion events, inhibitory activity tests against the RSV mutant strain B1 cp-52\u2014expressing only the F envelope glycoprotein\u2014and a plasmid-based reporter assay that quantifies the bioactivity of viral entry were also performed. The overall biological results, in conjunction with in silico modeling studies, supported the conclusion that the RSV fusion process could be the target of this new series of compounds.","publish_time":"2019-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piras, Sandra; Sanna, Giuseppina; Carta, Antonio; Corona, Paola; Ibba, Roberta; Loddo, Roberta; Madeddu, Silvia; Caria, Paola; Aulic, Suzana; Laurini, Erik; Fermeglia, Maurizio; Pricl, Sabrina","journal":"Front Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6476926.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibitors of RSV infection","RSV infection cycle","RSV fusion process","treatment of RSV infections","quest of new RSV inhibitors","early treatments of RSV patients","RSV mutant strain B1 cp","specific activity","antiviral activity","cell-based assays","virus-cell fusion events","inhibitory activity tests","primary cell lines","virus attachment","inhibitory effects","target","Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus","specific antiviral drugs","new series of compounds","early phase","effective vaccines","Clinical studies","phenyl-benzotriazoles","toxicity effects","plaque reduction assays","primary cause of bronchopneumonia","silico modeling studies","overall biological results","plasmid-based reporter assay","dividing T lymphoid-derived cells","low cytotoxicity","pre-exposure prophylaxis","conjunction","conclusion","\u03BCM concentrations","ribavirin","triazole derivatives","work","infants","RNA","lead compound","DNA viruses","prognosis","compelling need","bioactivity of viral entry","F envelope glycoprotein","children","myelosuppression","development","H-benzo","dichloro"],"language":"en"},

Short-read viral metagenomic studies have provided clues to viral function and first estimates of global viral gene abundance and distribution, but their assemblies are confounded by populations with high levels of strain evenness and nucleotide diversity (microdiversity), limiting assembly of some of the most abundant viruses on Earth. Such features also challenge assembly across genomic islands containing niche-defining genes that drive ecological speciation. These populations and features may be successfully captured by single-virus genomics and fosmid-based approaches, at least in abundant taxa, but at considerable cost and technical expertise. Here we established a low-cost, low-input, high throughput alternative sequencing and informatics workflow to improve viral metagenomic assemblies using short-read and long-read technology. The \u2018VirION\u2019 (Viral, long-read metagenomics via MinION sequencing) approach was first validated using mock communities where it was found to be as relatively quantitative as short-read methods and provided significant improvements in recovery of viral genomes. We then then applied VirION to the first metagenome from a natural viral community from the Western English Channel. In comparison to a short-read only approach, VirION: (i) increased number and completeness of assembled viral genomes; (ii) captured abundant, highly microdiverse virus populations, and (iii) captured more and longer genomic islands. Together, these findings suggest that VirION provides a high throughput and cost-effective alternative to fosmid and single-virus genomic approaches to more comprehensively explore viral communities in nature.","publish_time":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warwick-Dugdale, Joanna; Solonenko, Natalie; Moore, Karen; Chittick, Lauren; Gregory, Ann C.; Allen, Michael J.; Sullivan, Matthew B.; Temperton, Ben","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b386f0bbf59b80952e0320feacb36572c6c3b9ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6487183.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6487183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Western English Channel"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral function","viral communities","natural viral community","recovery of viral genomes","viral metagenomic assemblies","viral metagenomic studies","understanding of viral ecology","VirION","completeness of assembled viral genomes","estimates of global viral gene abundance","single-virus genomic approaches","abundant viruses","genomic islands","microdiverse virus populations","high throughput alternative sequencing","host community structure","single-virus genomics","community surveys","abundant taxa","assembly","features","fosmid-based approaches","lack of reference genomes","high levels of strain evenness","cost-effective alternative","host culturing","gene markers","MinION sequencing","Marine viruses","mock communities","global biogeochemical cycles","informatics workflow","influence","nucleotide diversity","clues","low-input","significant improvements","microdiversity","considerable cost","methods","genes","niche","limitations","distribution","number","Western English Channel","metagenomics","metagenome","technical expertise","ecological speciation","Earth","findings","nature","comparison","technology"],"language":"en"},

The use of live attenuated vaccines, however, carry the concern of reversion to virulence or genetic recombination with field strains. Currently there are no commercially available vaccines against ostrich-infecting mycoplasmas and this study therefore set out to develop and evaluate the use of a DNA vaccine against mycoplasma infections in ostriches using an OppA protein as antigen. To this end, the oppA gene of \u201CMycoplasma nasistruthionis sp. nov.\u201D str. Ms03 was cloned into two DNA vaccine expression vectors after codon correction by site-directed mutagenesis. Three-months-old ostriches were then vaccinated intramuscularly at different doses followed by a booster vaccination after 6 weeks. The ability of the DNA vaccines to elicit an anti-OppA antibody response was evaluated by ELISA using the recombinant OppA protein of Ms03 as coating antigen. A statistically significant anti-OppA antibody response could be detected after administration of a booster vaccination indicating that the OppA protein was successfully immunogenic. The responses were also both dose and vector dependent. In conclusion, the DNA vaccines were able to elicit an immune response in ostriches and can therefore be viewed as an option for the development of vaccines against mycoplasma infections.","publish_time":"2019-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wium, Martha; Jonker, Hester Isabella; Olivier, Adriaan Jacobus; Bellstedt, Dirk Uwe; Botes, Annelise","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62e4e3bb07c0d49b928f9cfb46d2efedc04991dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6527592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6527592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA vaccines","oppA gene","mycoplasma infections","recombinant OppA protein of Ms03","available vaccines","development of vaccines","significant anti-OppA antibody response","booster vaccination","Mycoplasma nasistruthionis","use of live attenuated vaccines","DNA vaccine expression vectors","immune response","months-old ostriches","coating antigen","ostrich-infecting mycoplasmas","codon correction","intensive rearing increases susceptibility","virulence","attractive alternative","ELISA","genetic recombination","population densities","site","pathogens","good management practices","food animals","antibiotics","field strains","concern of reversion","addition","administration","different doses","mutagenesis","study","conclusion","vector dependent","responses","unacceptable residues","option","weeks","ability"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, chronic moderate drinking (CMD) has been associated with improved cardiovascular health and immunity. These differential outcomes have been linked to alterations in both innate and adaptive branches of the immune system; however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this question, we determined the impact of chronic drinking on the transcriptional and functional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from male rhesus macaques classified as CMD or CHD after 12 months of voluntary ethanol self-administration. Our analysis suggests that chronic alcohol drinking, regardless of dose alters resting transcriptomes of PBMC, with the largest impact seen in innate immune cells. These transcriptional changes are partially explained by alterations in microRNA profiles. Additionally, chronic alcohol drinking is associated with a dose dependent heightened inflammatory profiled at resting and following LPS stimulation. Moreover, we observed a dose-dependent shift in the kinetics of transcriptional responses to LPS. These findings may explain the dichotomy in clinical and immunological outcomes observed with moderate versus heavy alcohol drinking.","publish_time":"2019-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sureshchandra, Suhas; Raus, Anthony; Jankeel, Allen; Ligh, Brian Jin Kee; Walter, Nicole A.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect after IRE and to evaluate the prognostic value of variations of the immune parameters in LAPC patients after IRE. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples of 34 patients were obtained preoperatively and on the third day (D3) and seventh day (D7) after IRE, respectively. The phenotypes of lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry, and dynamic changes of serum levels of cytokines, complement, and immunoglobulin were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and concordance index (C-index) were used to compare the survival predictive ability. RESULTS: There was a transitory decrease followed by a steady increase for CD4(\u002B) T cell, CD8(\u002B) T cell, NK cell, IL-2, C3, C4, and IgG while a reverse trend was detected for Treg cell, IL-6, and IL10 after IRE. The alteration of CD8(\u002B) T cell between D3 and D7 was identified as a prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The values of ROC curve (AUC) and C-indexes of the alteration of CD8(\u002B) T cell for OS and PFS were 0.816 and 0.773 and 0.816 and 0.639, respectively, which were larger than those of other immune or inflammation-based indexes. CONCLUSIONS: This study presented the first evidence of IRE-based immunomodulatory in patients with LAPC. The alteration of CD8(\u002B) T cell between D3 and D7 showed relatively good performance and could be used as an effective tool for prognostic evaluation for LAPC patients after IRE.","publish_time":"2019-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Chaobin; Wang, Jun; Sun, Shuxin; Zhang, Yu; Li, Shengping","journal":"J Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e423977e8070a5037558ac9dfdd78a6db6a64d58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6535893.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535893/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAPC","PFS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cell","Treg cell","NK cell","LAPC patients","alteration of CD8","D7","D3","evidence of IRE","prognostic factor","prognostic evaluation","overall survival","C-indexes","study","PFS","day","prognostic value of variations","values of ROC curve","progression-free survival","survival predictive ability","inflammation-based indexes","immune parameters","effective method","effective tool","concordance index","immunomodulatory effect","METHODS","dynamic changes of serum levels of cytokines","advanced pancreatic cancer","flow cytometry","Peripheral blood samples","AUC","steady increase","reverse trend","transitory decrease","IgG","C4","characteristic","C3","CD4","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","immunoglobulin","PURPOSE","Irreversible electroporation","Receiver","good performance","IL10","phenotypes of lymphocytes","RESULTS","aim","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Free-living nematodes, particularly from the clades Enoplia and Dorylaimia, have been underrepresented in genome-scale phylogenetic analyses to date, leading to poor resolution of deep relationships within the phylum. RESULTS: We supplemented publicly available data by sequencing transcriptomes of nine free-living nematodes and two important outgroups and conducted a phylum-wide phylogenomic analysis including a total of 108 nematodes. Analysis of a dataset generated using a conservative orthology inference strategy resulted in a matrix with a high proportion of missing data and moderate to weak support for branching within and placement of Enoplia. A less conservative orthology inference approach recovered more genes and resulted in higher support for the deepest splits within Nematoda, recovering Enoplia as the sister taxon to the rest of Nematoda. Relationships within major clades were similar to those found in previously published studies based on 18S rDNA. CONCLUSIONS: Expanded transcriptome sequencing of free-living nematodes has contributed to better resolution among deep nematode lineages, though the dataset is still strongly biased toward parasites. Inclusion of more free-living nematodes in future phylogenomic analyses will allow a clearer understanding of many interesting aspects of nematode evolution, such as morphological and molecular adaptations to parasitism and whether nematodes originated in a marine or terrestrial environment.

Among different treatments proposed, exogenous surfactant showed conflicting results. Aim of this multicenter retrospective observational study was to evaluate whether poractant alfa use in pediatric ARDS might improve gas exchange in children less than 2 years old, according to a shared protocol. METHODS: The study was carried out in fourteen Italian PICUs after dissemination of a standardized protocol for surfactant administration within the Italian PICU network. The protocol provides the administration of surfactant (50 mg/kg) divided in two doses: the first dose is used as a bronchoalveolar lavage while the second as supplementation. Blood gas exchange variations before and after surfactant use were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-nine children, age 0\u201324 months, affected by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome treated with exogenous porcine surfactant were enrolled. Data collection consisted of patient demographics, respiratory variables and arterial blood gas analysis. The most frequent reasons for PICU admission were acute respiratory failure, mainly bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and septic shock. Fifty-four children (78.3%) had severe ARDS (define by oxygen arterial pressure and inspired oxygen fraction ratio (P/F) \u003C 100), 15 (21.7%) had moderate ARDS (100 \u003C P/F \u003C 200). PO(2), P/F, Oxygenation Index (OI) and pH showed a significant improvement after surfactant use with respect to baseline (p \u003C 0.001 at each included time-point for each parameter). No significant difference in blood gas variations were observed among four different subgroups of diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, septic shock and others). Overall, 11 children died (15.9%) and among these, 10 (90.9%) had complex chronic conditions. Two children (18.2%) died while being treated with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Mortality for severe pARDS was 20.4%. CONCLUSION: The use of porcine Surfactant improves oxygenation, P/F ratio, OI and pH in a population of children with moderate or severe pARDS caused by multiple diseases. A shared protocol seems to be a good option to obtain the same criteria of enrollment among different PICUs and define a unique way of use and administration of the drug for future studies.","publish_time":"2019-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolfler, Andrea; Piastra, Marco; Amigoni, Angela; Santuz, Pierantonio; Gitto, Eloisa; Rossetti, Emanuele; Tinelli, Carmine; Montani, Cinzia; Savron, Fabio; Pizzi, Simone; D\u2019amato, Luigia; Mondardini, Maria Cristina; Conti, Giorgio; De Silvestri, Annalisa","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efe9c08c881908c9a617c23c8b0ae9e8c7307dbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6580470.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6580470/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","Pediatric Intensive Care Units","Acute Respiratory Distress","PICU","Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surfactant use","surfactant administration","administration of surfactant","use of porcine Surfactant","exogenous surfactant","exogenous porcine surfactant","Pediatric ARDS","severe ARDS","population of children","blood gas variations","moderate ARDS","F ratio","shared protocol","Blood gas exchange variations","arterial blood gas analysis","different PICUs","standardized protocol","severe pARDS","poractant alfa use","unique way of use","respiratory variables","acute respiratory failure","bronchiolitis","PICU admission","pneumonia","Italian PICUs","Italian PICU network","different subgroups of diseases","different treatments","Oxygenation Index","septic shock","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","oxygen arterial pressure","Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation","inspired oxygen fraction ratio","Pediatric Intensive Care Units","significant improvement","significant difference","multiple diseases","conflicting results","multicenter retrospective observational study","difficult challenge","patient demographics","respect","months","dissemination","frequent reasons","criteria of enrollment","drug","years old","baseline","Data collection","good option","bronchoalveolar lavage","ECMO","future studies","included time","CONCLUSION","complex chronic conditions","supplementation","parameter","Mortality","BACKGROUND","doses","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We demonstrate that the human PARPs - PARP10, PARP11 and PARP15 as well as a highly diverged PARP homologue TRPT1, ADP-ribosylate phosphorylated ends of RNA. We further reveal that ADP-ribosylation of RNA mediated by PARP10 and TRPT1 can be efficiently reversed by several cellular ADP-ribosylhydrolases (PARG, TARG1, MACROD1, MACROD2 and ARH3), as well as by MACROD-like hydrolases from VEEV and SARS viruses.

Recently, it has come to light that when these people infect others, the new infection is typically established by only one or a small number of virions from within this complex viral swarm. An important goal is to characterize the biological properties of HIV-1 virions that seed and exist early in new human infections because these are potentially the only viruses against which a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine would need to elicit protection. This includes understanding how the Envelope (Env) protein of these virions interacts with the T-cell receptor CD4, which supports attachment and entry of HIV-1 into target cells. We examined early HIV-1 isolates for their ability to infect cells via the CD4 receptor of 15 different primate species. Primates were the original source of HIV-1 and now serve as valuable animal models for studying HIV-1. We find that most primary isolates of HIV-1 from the blood, including early isolates, are highly selective and enter cells through some primate CD4 receptor orthologs but not others. This phenotype is remarkably consistent, regardless of route of transmission, viral subtype, or time of isolation post infection. We show that the weak CD4 binding affinity of blood-derived HIV-1 isolates is what makes them sensitive to the small sequence differences in CD4 from one primate species to the next. To substantiate this, we engineered an early HIV-1 Env to have high, medium, or low binding affinity to CD4, and we show that it loses the ability to enter cells via the CD4 receptor of many primate species as the binding affinity gets weaker. Based on the phenotype of selective use of primate CD4, we find that weak CD4 binding appears to be a nearly universal property of HIV-1 circulating in the bloodstream. Therefore, weak binding to CD4 must be a selected and important property in the biology of HIV-1 in the body. We identify six primate species that encode CD4 receptors that fully support the entry of early HIV-1 isolates despite their low binding affinity for CD4. These findings will help inform long-standing efforts to model HIV-1 transmission and early disease in primates.","publish_time":"2019-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warren, Cody J.; Meyerson, Nicholas R.; Dirasantha, Obaiah; Feldman, Emily R.; Wilkerson, Gregory K.; Sawyer, Sara L.","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0666ca679df1885492aa1420fd995790d363b8a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6586362.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6586362/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entry of HIV","derived HIV","biology of HIV","prophylactic HIV","entry of early HIV","primary isolates of HIV","CD4 receptors","primate CD4 receptor orthologs","universal property of HIV","early isolates","weak CD4 binding affinity of blood","biological properties of HIV","original source of HIV","phenotype of selective use of primate CD4","T-cell receptor CD4","weak binding","low binding affinity","different primate species","early disease","target cells","viral subtype","complex viral swarm","small number of virions","important property","Primates","ability","new infection","harbor complex viral populations","route of transmission","important goal","small sequence differences","new human infections","time of isolation post infection","attachment","bloodstreams","long-standing efforts","people","protein","vaccine","valuable animal models","findings","Envelope","viruses","light","protection","Individuals","body"],"language":"en"},

To perform these functions, the Golgi forms a multilayer stacked structure held by GRASP55 and GRASP65 trans-oligomers and perhaps their binding partners. Depletion of GRASP proteins disrupts Golgi stack formation and impairs critical functions of the Golgi, such as accurate protein glycosylation and sorting. However, how Golgi destruction affects other cellular activities is so far unknown. Here, we report that depletion of GRASP proteins reduces cell attachment and migration. Interestingly, GRASP depletion reduces the protein level of \u03B15\u03B21 integrin, the major cell adhesion molecule at the surface of HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells, due to decreased integrin protein synthesis. GRASP depletion also increases cell growth and total protein synthesis. These new findings enrich our understanding on the role of the Golgi in cell physiology and provide a potential target for treating protein-trafficking disorders.","publish_time":"2019-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahat, Erpan; Xiang, Yi; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Bekier, Michael E.; Wang, Yanzhuang","journal":"Mol Biol Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02450c2c82a1511cb5e1639d3b8438f69bbe11f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6589770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6589770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzczNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GRASP depletion","Depletion of GRASP proteins","Golgi apparatus","Golgi destruction","Golgi stack formation","total protein synthesis","protein-trafficking disorders","cell growth","cell physiology","cell attachment","decreased integrin protein synthesis","accurate protein glycosylation","protein level of \u03B15\u03B21 integrin","processing of proteins","major cell adhesion molecule","critical functions","GRASP55","surface of HeLa","GRASP65 trans-oligomers","potential target","multilayer stacked structure","center","cells","role","membrane-bound organelle","MDA-MB","cellular activities","understanding","migration","binding partners","sorting","lipids","new findings"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a new, one\u2010step, real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay was developed to detect two major Eurasian H9 lineages of AIV capable of causing human infection. The sensitivity of this assay was determined using in vitro\u2010transcribed RNA, and the detection limit was approximately 3 copies/reaction. In this assay, no cross\u2010reactivity was observed against RNA from H1\u201315 subtypes of influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses and other viral respiratory pathogens. In addition, this assay could detect the H9 hemagglutinin (HA) gene from artificially reconstituted clinical samples spiked with H9N2 virus without any non\u2010specific reactions. Therefore, this assay is highly sensitive and specific for H9 HA detection.

Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUC) are the most widely used therapies for HBV infection, but they often require long-lasting administration to avoid the risk of HBV reactivation at withdrawal. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments to shorten the duration of NUC therapy by accelerating virus control, and to complement the effect of available anti-viral therapies. In chronic HBV infection, virus-specific T cells are functionally defective, and this exhaustion state is a key determinant of virus persistence. Reconstitution of an efficient anti-viral T cell response may thus represent a rational strategy to treat chronic HBV patients. In this perspective, the enhancement of adaptive immune responses by a checkpoint inhibitor blockade, specific T cell vaccines, lymphocyte metabolism targeting, and autologous T cell engineering, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and TCR-redirected T cells, constitutes a promising immune modulatory approach for a therapeutic restoration of protective immunity. The advances of the emerging immune-based therapies in the setting of the HBV research field will be outlined.","publish_time":"2019-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boni, Carolina; Barili, Valeria; Acerbi, Greta; Rossi, Marzia; Vecchi, Andrea; Laccabue, Diletta; Penna, Amalia; Missale, Gabriele; Ferrari, Carlo; Fisicaro, Paola","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab9e34ee687f60a4de8ef675f307230e1b6c6f23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6600394.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6600394/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic HBV infection","virus-specific T cells","chronic HBV patients","specific T cell vaccines","risk of HBV reactivation","autologous T cell engineering","HBV research field","efficient anti-viral T cell response","TCR-redirected T cells","virus control","Chronic hepatitis B virus","emerging immune-based therapies","effect of available anti-viral therapies","key determinant of virus persistence","promising immune modulatory approach","enhancement of adaptive immune responses","duration of NUC therapy","risk of developing liver cirrhosis","checkpoint inhibitor blockade","lymphocyte metabolism","chimeric antigen receptor","setting","rational strategy","therapeutic restoration of protective immunity","worldwide public health concern","novel treatments","hepatocellular carcinoma","exhaustion state","people","ide analogues","Reconstitution","urgent need","advances","perspective","Nucleos","long-lasting administration","withdrawal"],"language":"en"},

Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza virus infections. However, conventional vaccines are only effective for a short period of time due to the propensity of influenza viruses to undergo antigenic drift and antigenic shift. The efficacy of these vaccines is uncertain from year-to-year due to potential mismatch between the circulating viruses and vaccine strains, and mutations arising due to egg adaptation. Subsequently, the inability to store these vaccines long-term and vaccine shortages are challenges that need to be overcome. Conventional vaccines also have variable efficacies for certain populations, including the young, old, and immunocompromised. This warrants for diverse efficacious vaccine developmental approaches, involving both active and passive immunization. As opposed to active immunization platforms (requiring the use of whole or portions of pathogens as vaccines), the rapidly developing passive immunization involves administration of either pathogen-specific or broadly acting antibodies against a kind or class of pathogens as a treatment to corresponding acute infection. Several antibodies with broadly acting capacities have been discovered that may serve as means to suppress influenza viral infection and allow the process of natural immunity to engage opsonized pathogens whilst boosting immune system by antibody-dependent mechanisms that bridge the innate and adaptive arms. By that; passive immunotherapeutics approach assumes a robust tool that could aid control of influenza viruses. In this review, we comment on some improvements in influenza management and promising vaccine development platforms with an emphasis on the protective capacity of passive immunotherapeutics especially when coupled with the use of antivirals in the management of influenza infection.","publish_time":"2019-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kotey, Erasmus; Lukosaityte, Deimante; Quaye, Osbourne; Ampofo, William; Awandare, Gordon; Iqbal, Munir","journal":"Vaccines (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75af9aa0e63889abde2eedaf0e41738b8ab082df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6630949.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6630949/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza management","management of influenza infection","propensity of influenza viruses","control of influenza viruses","influenza viral infection","conventional vaccines","passive immunization","vaccines long-term","influenza virus infections","vaccine strains","vaccine shortages","passive immunotherapeutics approach","active immunization platforms","promising vaccine development platforms","opsonized pathogens","class of pathogens","circulating viruses","portions of pathogens","protective capacity of passive immunotherapeutics","acting antibodies","year","acute infection","diverse efficacious vaccine developmental approaches","antigenic drift","antigenic shift","use of antivirals","acting capacities","emphasis","immune system","antibody-dependent mechanisms","robust tool","certain populations","warrants","best way","process of natural immunity","variable efficacies","mutations","pathogen-specific","improvements","potential mismatch","short period of time","disease","treatment","administration","kind","challenges","significant health burden","adaptive arms","egg adaptation","Vaccination","efficacy","inability","review"],"language":"en"},

The simplest way to understand the cross-presentation of peptides by different alleles is to classify these alleles into supertypes. A1 and A3 HLA supertypes are widely distributed in humans. However, direct structural and functional evidence for peptide presentation features of key alleles (e.g., HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03) are lacking. Herein, the molecular basis of peptide presentation of HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03 was demonstrated by crystal structure determination and thermostability measurements of complexes with T-cell epitopes from influenza virus (NP44), human immunodeficiency virus (RT313), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). When binding to the HIV peptide, RT313, the P\u03A9-Lys anchoring modes of HLA-A(*)30:01, and -A(*)30:03 were similar to those of HLA-A(*)11:01 in the A3 supertype. However, HLA-A(*)30:03, but not -A(*)30:01, also showed binding with the HLA(*)01:01-favored peptide, NP44, but with a specific structural conformation. Thus, different from our previous understanding, HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03 have specific peptide-binding characteristics that may lead to their distinct supertype-featured binding peptide motifs. Moreover, we also found that residue 77 in the F pocket was one of the key residues for the divergent peptide presentation characteristics of HLA-A(*)30:01 and -A(*)30:03. Interchanging residue 77 between HLA-A(*)30:01 and HLA-A(*)30:03 switched their presented peptide profiles. Our results provide important recommendations for screening virus and tumor-specific peptides among the population with prevalent HLA supertypes for vaccine development and immune interventions.","publish_time":"2019-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Shiyan; Liu, Kefang; Chai, Yan; Wu, Yanan; Lu, Dan; Xiao, Wenling; Cheng, Hao; Zhao, Yingze; Ding, Chunming; Lyu, Jianxin; Lou, Yongliang; Gao, George F.; Liu, William J.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a784ba89463c11f89c9a297dd0e980b2d27c5c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6664060.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6664060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["A3 HLA supertypes","divergent peptide presentation characteristics of HLA","prevalent HLA supertypes","molecular basis of peptide presentation of HLA","peptide-binding motifs","binding peptide motifs","HIV peptide","favored peptide","specific peptide-binding characteristics","peptide presentation features of key alleles","presented peptide profiles","P\u03A9-Lys anchoring modes of HLA","different alleles","cross-presentation","screening virus","influenza virus","human immunodeficiency virus","RT313","NP44","tumor-specific peptides","specific structural conformation","A3 supertype","T-cell epitopes","key residues","distinct supertype","Interchanging residue","subsequent T-cell receptor recognition","Human leukocyte antigen","population","thermostability measurements of complexes","vaccine development","functional evidence","important recommendations","crystal structure determination","immune interventions","results","high degree of polymorphism","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","F pocket","previous understanding","simplest way","MTB","humans"],"language":"en"},

Here, we evaluated tumor-treating fields\u2013mediated initiation of the macrophage-specific immune response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We subjected RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages to clinically relevant levels of tumor-treating fields (0.9 V/cm, 150 kHz) and evaluated alterations in cytokine expression and release, as well as cell viability. Additionally, we investigated the status of immunomodulatory pathways to determine their roles in tumor-treating fields\u2013mediated immune activation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results indicated that tumor-treating fields treatment at 0.9 V/cm decreased cell viability and increased cytokine messenger RNA/protein levels, as well as levels of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, relative to controls. The levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03B1, interleukin 1\u03B2, and interleukin 6 were markedly increased in tumor-treating fields\u2013treated RAW 264.7 cells cocultured with 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells compared with those in 4T1 or RAW 264.7 cells with or without tumor-treating fields treatment. Moreover, the viability of 4T1 cells treated with the conditioned medium of tumor-treating fields\u2013stimulated RAW 264.7 cells decreased, indicating that macrophage activation by tumor-treating fields effectively killed the tumor cells. Moreover, tumor-treating fields treatment activated the nuclear factor \u03BAB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways involved in immunomodulatory signaling.

The underlying hypothesis of this project was that inhibitors of autophagy reduce VZV infectivity. We selected the vacuolar proton ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 for analysis because of its well-known antiautophagy property of impeding acidification during the late stage of autophagic flux. We documented that bafilomycin treatment from 48 to 72 h postinfection lowered VZV titers substantially (P \u2264 0.008). Because we were unable to define the site of the block in the infectious cycle by confocal microscopy, we turned to electron microscopy. Capsids were observed in the nucleus, in the perinuclear space, and in the cytoplasm adjacent to Golgi apparatus vesicles. Many of the capsids had an aberrant appearance, as has been observed previously in infections not treated with bafilomycin. In contrast to prior untreated infections, however, secondary envelopment of capsids was not seen in the trans-Golgi network, nor were prototypical enveloped particles with capsids (virions) seen in cytoplasmic vesicles after bafilomycin treatment. Instead, multiple particles with varying diameters without capsids (light particles) were seen in large virus assembly compartments near the disorganized Golgi apparatus. Bafilomycin treatment also led to increased numbers of multivesicular bodies in the cytoplasm, some of which contained remnants of the Golgi apparatus. In summary, we have defined a previously unrecognized property of bafilomycin whereby it disrupted the site of secondary envelopment of VZV capsids by altering the pH of the trans-Golgi network and thereby preventing the correct formation of virus assembly compartments. IMPORTANCE This study of VZV assembly in the presence of bafilomycin A1 emphasizes the importance of the Golgi apparatus/trans-Golgi network as a platform in the alphaherpesvirus life cycle. We have previously shown that VZV induces levels of autophagy far above the basal levels of autophagy in human skin, a major site of VZV assembly. The current study documented that bafilomycin treatment led to impaired assembly of VZV capsids after primary envelopment/de-envelopment but before secondary reenvelopment. This VZV study also complemented prior herpes simplex virus 1 and pseudorabies virus studies investigating two other inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi apparatus function: brefeldin A and monensin. Studies with porcine herpesvirus demonstrated that primary enveloped particles accumulated in the perinuclear space in the presence of brefeldin A, while studies with herpes simplex virus 1 documented an impaired secondary assembly of enveloped viral particles in the presence of monensin.","publish_time":"2019-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Girsch, James H.; Walters, Katherine; Jackson, Wallen; Grose, Charles","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/446c633eb33c9168e597b53b0c93ead24aa9d43c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6694825.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6694825/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VZV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impaired assembly of VZV capsids","study of VZV assembly","VZV study","bafilomycin treatment","site of secondary envelopment of VZV capsids","secondary envelopment of capsids","Golgi apparatus vesicles","VZV titers","VZV infectivity","major site of VZV assembly","trans-Golgi network","disorganized Golgi apparatus","Golgi apparatus function","presence of bafilomycin A1","large virus assembly compartments","unrecognized property of bafilomycin","impaired secondary assembly of enveloped viral particles","primary enveloped particles","pseudorabies virus studies","correct formation of virus assembly compartments","prototypical enveloped particles","prior herpes simplex virus","light particles","primary envelopment","multiple particles","Varicella-zoster virus","de-envelopment","inhibitors of autophagy","secondary reenvelopment","presence of brefeldin","presence of monensin","vacuolar proton ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1","basal levels of autophagy","perinuclear space","IMPORTANCE","current study","prior untreated infections","alphaherpesvirus life cycle","cytoplasm adjacent","cytoplasmic vesicles","confocal microscopy","infectious cycle","electron microscopy","inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum","well-known antiautophagy property of impeding acidification","analysis","human skin","varying diameters","virions","platform","h postinfection","porcine herpesvirus","increased numbers of multivesicular bodies","late stage of autophagic flux","project","block","herpesviral neurovirulence protein ICP34","contrast","nucleus","remnants","underlying hypothesis","aberrant appearance","summary"],"language":"en"},

Male BALB/c mice were treated with different doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose (5, 50, and 100 mg/Kg) or dexamethasone at 5 mg/Kg (per os) 6 h after intra-tracheal instillation of LPS. Vehicle-treated mice were used as controls. Twenty-four hours after LPS challenge, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung samples were collected for analyses. They were evaluated by monitoring the expression of NF-\u03BAB, JNK, and cytokine genes and proteins, as well as cell migration and lung function. All doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose inhibited LPS-induced JNK and NF-\u03BAB activation. Likewise, the galloyl-HHDP-glucose-treated animals presented reduced expression of the TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03B2 genes in the lungs and reduced TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, IL-1\u03B2, and IL-8 protein levels when compared with the vehicle-treated LPS-challenged mice. In addition, the ALI mice treated with galloyl-HHDP-glucose also presented reduced lung inflammatory cell accumulation, especially that of neutrophils, in their BALF and lungs. In addition, galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment markedly ameliorated the LPS-induced pulmonary mechanism complications and attenuated weight loss. Overall, we showed for the first time that galloyl-HHDP-glucose protects against ALI, and may be useful for treating ALI and other inflammatory disorders.","publish_time":"2019-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinheiro, Aruan\u00E3 Joaquim Matheus Costa Rodrigues; Mendes, Aleff Ricardo Santos; Neves, Milena Dara Farias de Jesus; Prado, Carla M\u00E1ximo; Bittencourt-Mernak, M\u00E1rcia Isabel; Santana, Fernanda Paula Roncon; Lago, Jo\u00E3o Henrique G.; de S\u00E1, Joicy Cortez; da Rocha, Claudia Quintino; de Sousa, Eduardo Martins; Fontes, Val\u00E9ria Costa; Grisoto, Marco Augusto Gregolin; Falcai, Angela; Lima-Neto, Lidio Gon\u00E7alves","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a11d517c9cdd68c3671429751ed8420fb9fc1485.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6710369.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HHDP-glucose","galloyl-HHDP","ALI mice","glucose-treated animals","vehicle-treated LPS","glucose treatment","Vehicle-treated mice","LPS-induced JNK","LPS challenge","different doses of galloyl","c mice","therapeutic effects of galloyl","reduced expression","lung samples","lung function","reduced lung inflammatory cell accumulation","reduced TNF-\u03B1","intra-tracheal instillation of LPS","acute lung injury","expression of NF","BALF","\u03B2 genes","lungs","addition","NF-\u03BAB activation","pomegranate leaves","cell migration","cytokine genes","inflammatory disorders","ethyl acetate fraction of Punica granatum leaves","pulmonary mechanism complications","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","attenuated weight loss","proteins","lipopolysaccharide","hexahydroxydiphenoyl","hydroalcoholic extract","hours","neutrophils","protein levels","Male BALB","time","study","analyses","controls","anti-inflammatory activities","dexamethasone"],"language":"en"},

After entering into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), secretory proteins attain their native structure thanks to specific chaperones and enzymes. Only correctly folded molecules are allowed by quality control (QC) mechanisms to leave the ER and proceed to downstream compartments. Proteins that cannot fold properly are instead retained in the ER to be finally destined to proteasomal degradation. Exiting from the ER requires, in most cases, the use of coated vesicles, departing at the ER exit sites, which will fuse with the Golgi compartment, thus releasing their cargoes. Protein accumulation in the ER can be caused by a too stringent QC or by ineffective transport: these situations could be deleterious for the organism, due to the loss of the secreted protein, and to the cell itself, because of abnormal increase of protein concentration in the ER. In both cases, diseases can arise.

Transfer time should be an important considering factor and directly contacting and communicating with the specialized staff of foreign hospitals could also be very important to reduce unnecessary overseas hospital stay and cost incidence.","publish_time":"2019-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Jiena; Choi, Hyo Jeong; Kim, Ho Jung","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d1300359d8ec1682b0b6bdb51df4604a7ed4930.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6775375.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6775375/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["transport patients","transport time","mode of transportation","experiences of medical transportation of Korean travelers","longest time","Transfer time","ship","air ambulance","different transportation methods","South Korea","flight-stretchers","flight-prestige","medical repatriation","trauma cases","study period","regions","US Dollars","unnecessary overseas hospital","average","cost incidence","pedestrian injuries","similar distance","accidents","hospitalization","hours","specialized staff of foreign hospitals","Descriptive analyses","home","clinical data","aeromedical team","factor","aim","total"],"language":"en"},

In the current work, the effect of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria from different genera on the structural and functional characteristics of cells and the development of adenoviral infection in vitro was studied. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxicity of six EPSs of lactic acid bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus was determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. The influence of the EPSs on the infectivity of human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) and on the cell cycle under a condition of adenovirus infection was studied using plaque reduction assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Results: It was shown that exopolysaccharides were non-toxic to Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBK) as they reduced their viability by 3\u201317%. A change in the distribution of the cell cycle phases in the non-infected cell population treated with EPSs was observed. The analysis demonstrated an increase in the number of cells in the S phase by 47% when using EPSs 15a and a decrease in the number of cells in the G1 phase by 20\u201327% when treated with the EPSs 15a, 33a, and 19s. The use of EPSs did not led to the normalization of the life cycle of HAdV-5 infected cells to the level of non-infected cells. The EPSs showed low virucidal activity and reduced the HAdV-5 infectivity to 85%. Among the studied exopolysaccharides, anti-adenovirus activity was found for EPS 26a that is produced by Lactobacillus spp. strain. The treatment of cells with the EPS following virus adsorption completely (100%) suppressed the formation and release of HAdV-5 infectious. Conclusions: EPS 26a possessed distinct anti-HAdV-5 activity and the obtained data demonstrate the potential of using exopolysaccharides as anti-adenoviral agents.","publish_time":"2019-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biliavska, Liubov; Pankivska, Yulia; Povnitsa, Olga; Zagorodnya, Svitlana","journal":"Medicina (Kaunas)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01be6aef7ae6555eef2062bddb57f8643d1244e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6780409.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6780409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pediococcus"],"organizations":["MTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of EPSs","number of cells","treatment of cells","EPSs of lactic acid bacteria","studied exopolysaccharides","level of non-infected cells","anti-adenovirus activity","functional characteristics of cells","life cycle of HAdV","release of HAdV","possessed distinct anti-HAdV","effect of exopolysaccharides","cell cycle phases","non-infected cell population","Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells","genera Lactobacillus","condition of adenovirus infection","anti-adenoviral agents","infectivity of human adenovirus type","low virucidal activity","development of adenoviral infection","different genera","S phase","G1 phase","plaque reduction assay","flow cytometric analysis","treatment of viral diseases","use of antagonistic probiotic microorganisms","byproducts","promising approach","MDBK","Leuconostoc","potential","Cytotoxicity","objectives","Pediococcus","distribution","obtained data","normalization","diphenyl tetrazolium bromide","Conclusions","current work","Methods","virus adsorption","increase","decrease","Materials","MTT","Background","change","formation","influence","dimethylthiazol","viability","strain","Results"],"language":"en"},

PROBLEM: Despite education about infection prevention practices, frequent RV outbreaks were declared each year at our rehabilitation facility. METHODS: Before and after study design. The primary outcome was the number of bed closure days due to outbreak per overall bed days. Process measures included delays in initiation of transmission-based precautions, RV testing and reporting of staff to occupational health and safety (OHS). Balancing measures included the number of isolation days and staff missed work hours. INTERVENTIONS: Based on comprehensive analysis of prior outbreaks, the following changes were implemented: (1) clear criteria for initiation of transmission-based precautions, (2) communication to visitors to avoid visitation if infectious symptoms were present, (3) exemption of staff absences if documented due to infectious illness, (4) development of an electronic programme providing guidance to staff about whether they should be excluded from work due to infectious illness. RESULTS: The number of bed closure days due to outbreak per overall bed days dropped from 2.8% to 0.5% during the intervention season and sustained at 0.6% during the postintervention season (p\u003C0.001). There were fewer delays in initiation of droplet and contact precautions (28.8% to 15.5%, p=0.005) and collection of RV testing (42.9% to 20.3%, p\u003C0.001), better reporting to OHS (9 vs 28.8 reports per 100 employees; p\u003C0.001) and fewer isolation days (7.8% vs 7.3%; p=0.02) without a significant increase in missed work hours per 100 hours worked (4.0 vs 3.9; p=0.12).

METHODS: We compared the results of a liquid bead array xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP; (Luminex Corporation, Toronto, Canada) and a solid microarray Verigene Respiratory Virus Plus (RV\u002B; Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) for the detection of influenza A virus (INF A), influenza B virus (INF B), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 170 respiratory specimens from hospitalized patients. RESULTS: Overall, xTAG RVP demonstrated sensitivities and specificities of 97.6 and 100% for INF A, 100 and 99.4% for INF B, and 100 and 100% for RSV, while the Verigene RV\u002B test sensitivities and specificities were 95.1 and 98.5%, 100.0 and 99.4%, and 97.1 and 100%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the area under the curves between the two assays for each virus (P = 0.364 for INF A, P = 1.000 for INF B, P = 0.317 for RSV). Comparing the results of two assays, discordant results were present mostly due to subtype assignments and identification of coinfections. The detection of viruses was not significantly different (P = 1.000) and the virus/subtype assignment showed good agreement with kappa coefficients of 0.908. CONCLUSION: The xTAG RVP and Verigene RV\u002B showed high sensitivities and specificities, and good overall agreement in detection and identification of INF and RSV. These assays can be used in clinical settings for a reliable detection of respiratory viruses found commonly in hospitalized patients.","publish_time":"2014-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Sang Mee; Lim, Mi Suk; Han, Minsuk; Hong, Yun Ji; Kim, Taek Soo; Lee, Hye Ryun; Song, Eun Young; Park, Kyoung Un; Song, Junghan; Kim, Eui Chong","journal":"Journal of Clinical Laboratory Analysis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75213ed678ea6e124b6adc412f503b6a6db13c1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6807105.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6807105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Luminex Corporation","Verigene Respiratory Virus Plus","INF B","Verigene RV","INF B, P","INF"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["INF B","respiratory syncytial virus","identification of INF","influenza B virus","detection of viruses","RSV","reliable detection of respiratory viruses","solid microarray Verigene Respiratory Virus","respiratory specimens","detection of influenza","simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses","Verigene RV","xTAG RVP","specificities","assays","liquid bead array xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel","discordant results","good agreement","good overall agreement","high sensitivities","test sensitivities","hospitalized patients","subtype assignments","identification of coinfections","Canada","Nucleic acid amplification tests","Luminex Corporation","Toronto","kappa coefficients","clinical settings","BACKGROUND","IL","Northbrook","Nanosphere","area","curves","CONCLUSION","significant differences","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The mutant virus had similar growth kinetics to MHV-A59 wild-type virus in 17CI-1 cells, but was highly attenuated in vivo. Moreover, the mutant virus completely protected C57BL/6 mice from a lethal MHV-A59 challenge. To further analyze the mechanism of the attenuation of the mutant virus, changes in reporter gene expression were measured in nsp1- or nsp1-27D-expressing cells; the results showed that nsp1 inhibited reporter gene expression controlled by different promoters, but that this inhibition was reduced for nsp1-27D.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with PTB. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Global Health, for cohort and case-control studies that reported risk factors for in-hospital mortality in PTB. We pooled all factors that were assessed for an association, and presented relative associations as pooled odds ratios (ORs). Results: We identified 2,969 records, of which we retrieved 51 in full text; 11 cohort studies that evaluated 5,468 patients proved eligible. Moderate quality evidence suggested an association with co-morbid malignancy and in-hospital mortality (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.01\u20133.40). Low quality evidence showed no association with positive sputum smear (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.40\u20132.48), or male sex (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.84\u20131.41), and very low quality evidence showed no association with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.31, 95% IC 0.38\u20134.46), and previous TB infection (OR 2.66, 95% CI 0.48\u201314.87).

Noroviruses are the primary cause of nonbacterial diarrheal outbreaks in humans, whilst rotaviruses are a major cause of childhood diarrhea. Although both enteric pathogens substantially impact human health and economies, there are no approved drugs against noroviruses and rotaviruses so far. On the other hand, whilst the currently licensed rotavirus vaccines have been successfully implemented in over 100 countries, the most advanced norovirus vaccine has recently completed phase-I and II trials. METHODS: We performed a structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research litera-ture on advances in the fields of norovirus and rotavirus therapeutics and immunoprophylaxis. RESULTS: Technological advances coupled with a proper understanding of viral morphology and replication over the past decade has facilitated pioneering research on therapeutics and immunoprophylaxis against noroviruses and rotaviruses, with promising outcomes in human clinical trials of some of the drugs and vaccines. This review focuses on the various developments in the fields of norovirus and rotavirus thera-peutics and immunoprophylaxis, such as potential antiviral drug molecules, passive immunotherapies (oral human immunoglobulins, egg yolk and bovine colostral antibodies, llama-derived nanobodies, and anti-bodies expressed in probiotics, plants, rice grains and insect larvae), immune system modulators, probiot-ics, phytochemicals and other biological substances such as bovine milk proteins, therapeutic nanoparti-cles, hydrogels and viscogens, conventional viral vaccines (live and inactivated whole virus vaccines), and genetically engineered viral vaccines (reassortant viral particles, virus-like particles (VLPs) and other sub-unit recombinant vaccines including multi-valent viral vaccines, edible plant vaccines, and encapsulated viral particles).

As the number of available RNA-protein binding experimental data has increased rapidly due to high-throughput sequencing methods, it is now possible to measure and understand RNA-protein interactions by computational methods. In this study, we integrate a sequence-based derived kernel with regularized least squares to perform prediction. The derived kernel exploits the contextual information around an amino acid or a nucleic acid as well as the repetitive conserved motif information. We propose a novel machine learning method, called RPiRLS to predict the interaction between any RNA and protein of known sequences. For the RPiRLS classifier, each protein sequence comprises up to 20 diverse amino acids but for the RPiRLS-7G classifier, each protein sequence is represented by using 7-letter reduced alphabets based on their physiochemical properties. We evaluated both methods on a number of benchmark data sets and compared their performances with two newly developed and state-of-the-art methods, RPI-Pred and IPMiner. On the non-redundant benchmark test sets extracted from the PRIDB, the RPiRLS method outperformed RPI-Pred and IPMiner in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Further, RPiRLS achieved an accuracy of 92% on the prediction of lncRNA-protein interactions. The proposed method can also be extended to construct RNA-protein interaction networks.

Differences by intervention group in reported infectious disease (primary outcome) and antibiotic use (secondary outcome) were assessed using mixed effects logistic regression and Fisher\u2019s Exact tests, respectively. RESULTS: Infectious illness occurred in 6% of weeks, with upper respiratory illness the predominant syndrome. Among 60 (45%) TC-exposed and 73 (55%) non-TC-exposed babies, infectious disease reports did not differ in frequency between groups (likelihood ratio test: p = 0.88). Medical visits with antibiotic prescriptions were less common in the TC group than in the non-TC group (7.8% vs. 16.6%, respectively; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Although randomization to TC-containing wash products was not associated with decreased infectious disease reports by mothers, TCs were associated with decreased antibiotic prescriptions, suggesting a benefit against bacterial infection. The recent removal of TCs from consumer wash products makes further elucidation of benefits and risks impracticable.","publish_time":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ley, Catherine; Sundaram, Vandana; Sanchez, Maria de la Luz; Desai, Manisha; Parsonnet, Julie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95bd6a3d04bd47a4a7683ea948e6de05125a34c6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b5b3d491ce72ba843d589539a807b0cf32946849.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6023107.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023107/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozky0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["TC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of TC","antibiotic use","Infectious illness","decreased infectious disease reports","consumer wash products","personal wash products","non-TC group","infectious diseases","decreased antibiotic prescriptions","randomized intervention of wash products","Maternal reports of infectious disease symptoms","non-TC-exposed babies","intervention group","recent removal of TCs","household visits","Medical visits","primary outcome","secondary outcome","incidence of infection","bacterial infection","wide variety of household","upper respiratory illness","medical chart review","Urinary triclosan levels","mixed effects logistic regression","frequency","Fisher\u2019s Exact tests","mothers","elucidation of benefits","automated survey","groups","likelihood ratio test","triclocarban","children","predominant syndrome","weeks","randomization","risks impracticable","multiethnic birth cohort","broad-spectrum antimicrobials","BACKGROUND","Differences","participant subset","year of age","months","consumers","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Several dengue diagnosis methods are recommended by WHO. The application of specific laboratory tests is still limited due to high cost, lack of equipment, and uncertain validity. Therefore, clinical diagnosis remains a common practice especially in resource limited settings. Bayesian networks have been shown to be a useful tool for diagnostic decision support. This study aimed to construct Bayesian network models using basic demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles of acute febrile illness patients to diagnose dengue. Data of 397 acute undifferentiated febrile illness patients who visited the fever clinic of the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Thailand, were used for model construction and validation. The two best final models were selected: one with and one without NS1 rapid test result. The diagnostic accuracy of the models was compared with that of physicians on the same set of patients. The Bayesian network models provided good diagnostic accuracy of dengue infection, with ROC AUC of 0.80 and 0.75 for models with and without NS1 rapid test result, respectively. The models had approximately 80% specificity and 70% sensitivity, similar to the diagnostic accuracy of the hospital\u2019s fellows in infectious disease. Including information on NS1 rapid test improved the specificity, but reduced the sensitivity, both in model and physician diagnoses. The Bayesian network model developed in this study could be useful to assist physicians in diagnosing dengue, particularly in regions where experienced physicians and laboratory confirmation tests are limited.","publish_time":"2018-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sa-ngamuang, Chaitawat; Haddawy, Peter; Luvira, Viravarn; Piyaphanee, Watcharapong; Iamsirithaworn, Sopon; Lawpoolsri, Saranath","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ab40cd143985f0fe1f581a31c3aa4009e94e759.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6023245.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozkz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["dengue patients","Bayesian network models","laboratory profiles of acute febrile illness patients","acute undifferentiated febrile illness patients","set of patients","diagnosing dengue","good diagnostic accuracy of dengue infection","NS1 rapid test result","dengue diagnosis methods","best final models","experienced physicians","Bayesian networks","laboratory confirmation tests","diagnostic decision support","study","clinical diagnosis","sensitivity","specificity","model construction","application of specific laboratory tests","resource limited settings","useful tool","basic demographic","Bangkok Hospital","Thailand","common practice","fever clinic","regions","great challenge","lack of equipment","hospital\u2019s fellows","Tropical Diseases","ROC AUC","Data","high cost","infectious disease","uncertain validity","information","physician diagnoses","validation"],"language":"en"},

However, data on the immunological interplay between influenza and secondary infections are equivocal, with some studies reporting influenza-induced augmentation of the immune response, whereas others demonstrate that influenza suppresses the immune response towards a subsequent challenge. These contrasting results may be due to the use of various types of live bacteria as secondary challenges, which impedes clear interpretation of causal relations, and to differences in timing of the secondary challenge relative to influenza infection. Herein, we investigated whether influenza infection results in an enhanced or suppressed innate immune response upon a secondary challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in either the acute or the recovery phase of infection. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were intranasally inoculated with 5 \u00D7 10(3) PFU influenza virus (pH1N1, strain A/Netherlands/602/2009) or mock treated. After 4 (acute phase) or 10 (recovery phase) days, 5 mg/kg LPS or saline was administered intravenously, and mice were sacrificed 90 min later. Cytokine levels in plasma and lung tissue, and lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) content were determined. RESULTS: LPS administration 4 days after influenza infection resulted in a synergistic increase in TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, and IL-6 concentrations in lung tissue, but not in plasma. This effect was also observed 10 days after influenza infection, albeit to a lesser extent. LPS-induced plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were enhanced 4 days after influenza infection, whereas a trend towards increased pulmonary IL-10 concentrations was found. LPS-induced increases in pulmonary MPO content tended to be enhanced as well, but only at 4 days post-infection. CONCLUSIONS: An LPS challenge in the acute phase of influenza infection results in an enhanced pulmonary pro-inflammatory innate immune response. These data increase our insight on influenza-bacterial interplay. Combing data of the present study with previous findings, it appears that this enhanced response is not beneficial in terms of protection against secondary infections, but rather damaging by increasing immunopathology.","publish_time":"2018-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koch, R.

The use of probiotics to combat bacterial pathogens has gained a rising interest. Pathogenic Escherichia coli is causative of multiple clinical syndromes such as diarrheal diseases, meningitis and urinary tract infections. In this work, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotics to control multidrug-resistant E. coli and reduce their ability to form biofilms. Six E. coli resistant to at least five antibiotics (Ceftazidime, Ampicillin, Clarithromycin, Amoxicillin \u002B Clavulanic Acid and Ceftriaxone) were isolated in this work. Preparations of cell-free spent media (CFSM) of six probiotics belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus which were grown in Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) broth exhibited strong antibacterial activity (inhibition zones of 11.77\u201323.10 mm) against all E. coli isolates. Two E. coli isolates, namely E. coli WW1 and IC2, which were most resistant to all antibiotics were subjected to antibiofilm experiments. Interestingly, the CFSM of MRS fermented by all probiotics resulted in inhibition of biofilm formation while B. longum caused highest inhibition (57.94%) in case of E. coli IC2 biofilms and L. plantarum was responsible for 64.57% reduction of E. coli WW1 biofilms. On the other hand, CFSM of skim milk fermented by L. helveticus and L. rhamnosus exhibited a slight inhibitory activity against IC2 isolate (inhibition percentage of 31.52 and 17. 68, respectively) while WW1 isolate biofilms was reduced by CFSM of milk fermented by B. longum and L. helveticus (70.81 and 69.49 reduction percentage, respectively).

ANIMALS: All imported horses with signed owner consent (n = 167) entering a USDA quarantine for contagious equine metritis from October 2014 to June 2016 were enrolled in the study. METHODS: Prospective observational study. Enrolled horses had a physical examination performed and nasal secretions collected at the time of entry and subsequently if any horse developed signs of respiratory disease during quarantine. Samples were assayed for equine influenza virus (EIV), equine herpesvirus type\u20101, \u22122, \u22124, and \u22125 (EHV\u20101, \u22122, \u22124, \u22125), equine rhinitis virus A (ERAV), and B (ERBV) and Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi) using quantitative PCR (qPCR).

The results of all nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples sent for the test for respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus) were extracted from the electronic healthcare records. Clinical characteristics were compared between groups with positive versus negative results for respiratory viruses. Multivariable regression models were employed by including age, gender, type of sample (swab vs sputum), source (emergency department vs others), and season to explore the independent factors associated with positive results for respiratory viruses. A total of 34,961 samples were identified during the study period. A total of 3102 (8.9%) samples were positive for adenovirus, 2811 (8.0%) were positive for influenza A, 3460 (9.9%) were positive for influenza B, and 4527 (13.0%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus. The positive rate of adenovirus was highest in April (50.8%), and lowest in November (3%). The absolute number of positive samples for adenovirus was highest in June (n = 587) and April (n = 544).

Significant advances in solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) have enabled the efficient construction of macrocyclic peptide and peptidomimetic libraries with macrolactamization being performed on-resin or in solution phase. The primary goal of this review is to summarize solid-phase cyclohexapeptide synthesis using the on-resin and solution-phase macrocyclization methodologies published since 2013.

Studies with type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice revealed a key role of the IFN-I axis in the protection against CVB3 infection, whereas the source of IFN-I and cell types that have to be IFNAR triggered in order to promote survival are still unknown. We found that CVB3 infected IFN-\u03B2 reporter mice showed effective reporter induction, especially in hepatocytes and only to a minor extent in liver-resident macrophages. Accordingly, upon in vitro CVB3 infection of primary hepatocytes from murine or human origin abundant IFN-\u03B2 responses were induced. To identify sites of IFNAR-triggering we performed experiments with Mx reporter mice, which upon CVB3 infection showed massive luciferase induction in the liver. Immunohistological studies revealed that during CVB3 infection MX1 expression of hepatocytes was induced primarily by IFNAR-, and not by IFN-III receptor (IFNLR)-triggering. CVB3 infection studies with primary human hepatocytes, in which either the IFN-I or the IFN-III axis was inhibited, also indicated that primarily IFNAR-, and to a lesser extent IFNLR-triggering was needed for ISG induction. Interestingly, CVB3 infected mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed severe liver cell necrosis and ubiquitous viral dissemination that resulted in lethal disease, as similarly detected in classical IFNAR(-/-) mice. In conclusion, we found that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes are major IFN-I producers and that the liver is also the organ that shows strong IFNAR-triggering. Importantly, hepatocytes need to be IFNAR-triggered in order to prevent virus dissemination and to assure survival. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes serve as important IFN-I producers and sensors not only in the murine, but also in the human system.","publish_time":"2018-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koestner, Wolfgang; Spanier, Julia; Klause, Tanja; Tegtmeyer, Pia-K.; Becker, Jennifer; Herder, Vanessa; Borst, Katharina; Todt, Daniel; Lienenklaus, Stefan; Gerhauser, Ingo; Detje, Claudia N.; Geffers, Robert; Langereis, Martijn A.; Vondran, Florian W.

METHODS: One-hundred ninety two participants aged 65 and over completed interview-based questionnaires about chronotype, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, a small subset of subjects completed a 7-day sleep diary and actigraphy measurements. RESULTS: Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) scores were significantly negatively correlated with Midpoint of sleep on free days corrected for sleep debt accumulated through weekdays (MSFsc) (r=-0.45, p\u003C0.01) assessed by the MCTQ. MSFsc using the MCTQ was significantly positively correlated with MSFsc assessed by both the sleep diary (r=0.74, p\u003C0.05) and actigraphy (r=0.76, p\u003C0.05). Additionally, MSFsc assessed by the MCTQ was significantly positively correlated with insomnia (r=0.26, p\u003C0.01), depression (r=0.25, p\u003C0.01), and anxiety (r=0.18, p\u003C0.05). Finally, based on MEQ scores, we derived a cut-off score for the MCTQ that distinguishes morning type and other types (intermediate/evening types) in older adults. CONCLUSION: The results of these studies supported the validity of the MCTQ in Korean older adults. Additionally, while sleep rhythms in elder adults may be more advanced, eveningness tendency may be still important and indicative of sleep and psychological disturbance.","publish_time":"2018-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ryu, Hyera; Joo, Eun Yeon; Choi, Su Jung; Suh, Sooyeon","journal":"Psychiatry Investig","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0612bb6d157e8cd266943d84daf110c46a56aa23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6111220.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6111220/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire","MCTQ","MSFsc"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MCTQ","MSFsc","indicative of sleep","sleep debt","Midpoint of sleep","day sleep diary","sample of Korean older adults","elder adults","insomnia","depression","MEQ scores","RESULTS","anxiety","Munich ChronoType Questionnaire","Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire","evening types","eveningness tendency","actigraphy measurements","completed interview-based questionnaires","psychometric properties","free days","validity","morning type","studies","cut-off score","weekdays","psychological disturbance","study","small subset of subjects","CONCLUSION","participants","rhythms","OBJECTIVE","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Clinical records from 572 cats tested using a point-of-care ELISA at a first-opinion veterinary practice between 7 April 2010 and 23 June 2016 were also obtained and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify risk factors for test positivity. Survival times were estimated using Kaplan\u2013Meier methods. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 112 clinics (26.4%) of which 72 performed in-house testing. Of the 2125 tests performed, 56 (2.6%) were positive for FeLV and 393 (18.5%) were positive for FIV. Fewer than 1% of cats were vaccinated for FeLV, with veterinarians citing low perceived prevalence as the primary reason for not vaccinating. Being male compared with being female and having clinical evidence of immunosuppression were significant risk factors for both FeLV and FIV test positivity. The median survival times of FeLV and FIV test-positive cats were 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0\u201316) and 650 days (95% CI 431\u2013993), respectively.

Objectives: Due to the lack of pharmacological studies on this herbal medicine, we explored the inhibitory activity of torilidis fructus on the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response using its ethanol extract (Tf-EE). Material and methods: The Griess assay and prostaglandin (PGE(2)) ELISA assay were conducted with Tf-EE (0-75 \u00B5g/mL) and LPS (1 \u00B5g/mL) treated RAW264.7 cells in cultured media. Tf-EE pretreated RAW264.7 cells were incubated with LPS for 6 h and semi-quantitative PCR was performed. Reporter gene assays, overexpression of target enzymes and immunoblotting were performed on macrophages to determine the molecular targets of Tf-EE. Results: Tf-EE markedly suppressed the inflammatory response of macrophages, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) and PGE(2) production with IC(50) values of 35.66 and 62.47 \u00B5g/mL, respectively. It was also found that Tf-EE reduced the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 by 80%. Nuclear translocation and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03BAB (p65 and p50) were declined by 60% and 30% respectively, and their regulatory events including the phosphorylation of AKT, I\u03BAB\u03B1, Src, and the formation of complexes between Src and p-p85 were also recognized to be diminished. Conclusions: The signalling events managed by Src and p85 complex seemed to be critically involved in Tf-EE-mediated anti-inflammatory response. This might suggest that Tf-EE exhibited anti-inflammatory effects through Src-targeted inhibition of NF-\u03BAB.","publish_time":"2017-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Gyubyung; Kim, Eunji; Son, Young-Jin; Yoon, Deok Hyo; Sung, Gi-Ho; Aravinthan, Adithan; Park, Yung Chul; Kim, Jong-Hoon; Cho, Jae Youl","journal":"Pharm Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a2d0c94c7467bc93eab84eb348c458e85738aa3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6130681.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6130681/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Torilidis"],"organizations":["PCR","PGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Tf-EE pretreated RAW264","molecular targets of Tf","LPS","\u00B5g","inflammatory response of macrophages","anti-inflammatory response","Src-targeted inhibition of NF","PGE","cells","various inflammatory diseases","inhibitory activity of torilidis fructus","anti-inflammatory effects","herbal medicine","Nuclear translocation","Griess assay","signalling events","ELISA assay","regulatory events","p-p85","p85 complex","activation of nuclear factor","Umbelliferae","overexpression of target enzymes","fruits of Torilis japonica Decadolle","iNOS","phosphorylation of AKT","formation of complexes","Reporter gene assays","ethanol extract","expression of inducible","synthase","lack of pharmacological studies","methods","immunoblotting","I\u03BAB\u03B1","prostaglandin","lipopolysaccharide","semi-quantitative PCR","nitric oxide","pesticide","cyclooxygenase","medicinal herb","production","astrictive","Material","values","p65","cultured media","Context","COX","p50","Conclusions","Results","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) attract much attention in the biomedical field and are used as carriers of drugs in current research studies. In this study, SeNPs were decorated by RBV, and the novel nanoparticle system was well characterized. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells were infected with H1N1 influenza virus before treatment with RBV, SeNPs, and SeNPs loaded with RBV (Se@RBV). METHODS AND RESULTS: MTT assay showed that Se@RBV nanoparticles protect cells during H1N1 infection in vitro. Se@RBV depressed virus titer in the culture supernatant. Intracellular localization detection revealed that Se@RBV accumulated in lysosome and escaped to cytoplasm as time elapsed. Furthermore, activation of caspase-3 was resisted by Se@RBV. Expressions of proteins related to caspase-3, including cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, caspase-8, and Bax, were downregulated evidently after treatment with Se@RBV compared with the untreated infection group. In addition, phosphorylations of phosphorylated 38 (p38), JNK, and phosphorylated 53 (p53) were inhibited as well. In vivo experiments indicated that Se@RBV was found to prevent lung injury in H1N1-infected mice through hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tunel test of lung tissues present that DNA damage reached a high level but reduced substantially when treated with Se@RBV. Immunohistochemical test revealed an identical result with the in vitro experiment that activations of caspase-3 and proteins on the apoptosis pathway were restrained by Se@RBV treatment. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study elaborates that Se@RBV is a novel promising agent against H1N1 influenza virus infection.","publish_time":"2018-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Zhengfang; Li, Yinghua; Gong, Guifang; Xia, Yu; Wang, Changbing; Chen, Yi; Hua, Liang; Zhong, Jiayu; Tang, Ying; Liu, Xiaomin; Zhu, Bing","journal":"Int J Nanomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11af78fdd83655124c3b5acce4cfb92f0aafe4f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6165773.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165773/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RBV treatment","RBV nanoparticles","RBV depressed virus titer","SeNPs","H1N1 infection","H1N1 influenza virus infection","activations of caspase","activation of caspase","H1N1-infected mice","study","untreated infection group","lung injury","Tunel test of lung tissues","Selenium nanoparticles","Immunohistochemical test","Expressions of proteins","phosphorylations of phosphorylated","novel promising agent","novel nanoparticle system","Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells","DNA damage","MTT assay","carriers of drugs","cleaved poly-ADP","ribose polymerase","hematoxylin","identical result","culture supernatant","current research studies","eosin staining","RESULTS","attention","lysosome","Intracellular localization detection","apoptosis pathway","broad-spectrum antiviral drug","cytoplasm","biomedical field","high level","METHODS","JNK","p38","Ribavirin","time elapsed","addition","INTRODUCTION","Bax","experiments","p53","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In the context of vaccine development remarkable efforts have been made to develop new vaccines and also to improve the efficacy of existing vaccines against specific diseases. To date, some vaccines are developed from protein subunits or killed pathogens, whilst several vaccines are based on live-attenuated organisms, which carry the risk of regaining their pathogenicity under certain immunocompromised conditions. To avoid this, the development of risk-free effective vaccines in conjunction with adequate delivery systems are considered as an imperative need to obtain desired humoral and cell-mediated immunity against infectious diseases. In the last several years, the use of nanoparticle-based vaccines has received a great attention to improve vaccine efficacy, immunization strategies, and targeted delivery to achieve desired immune responses at the cellular level. To improve vaccine efficacy, these nanocarriers should protect the antigens from premature proteolytic degradation, facilitate antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, control release, and should be safe for human use. Nanocarriers composed of lipids, proteins, metals or polymers have already been used to attain some of these attributes. In this context, several physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles play an important role in the determination of vaccine efficacy. This review article focuses on the applications of nanocarrier-based vaccine formulations and the strategies used for the functionalization of nanoparticles to accomplish efficient delivery of vaccines in order to induce desired host immunity against infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2018-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pati, Rashmirekha; Shevtsov, Maxim; Sonawane, Avinash","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ebae5a999522c721177ba353fbd95a72439e060.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6180194.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6180194/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["based vaccines","new vaccines","efficacy of existing vaccines","efficient delivery of vaccines","determination of vaccine efficacy","immunization of infectious diseases","based vaccine formulations","development of risk-free effective vaccines","specific diseases","context of vaccine development remarkable efforts","targeted delivery","desired host immunity","immunization strategies","nanocarriers","years","desired immune responses","adequate delivery systems","antigen uptake","great attention","great challenge","functionalization of nanoparticles","use of nanoparticle","human use","cell-mediated immunity","physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles","emergence of new variants of pathogenic micro-organisms","conjunction","treatment","processing","important role","order","premature proteolytic degradation","applications of nanocarrier","cells","imperative need","control release","pathogenicity","lipids","proteins","antigens","cellular level","certain immunocompromised conditions","live-attenuated organisms","metals","polymers","past","protein subunits","pathogens","review article","date","attributes"],"language":"en"},

Counter-intuitively, expression of one member of the family, IFN\u03BB4, is associated with decreased clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the human population; by contrast, a natural frameshift mutation that abrogates IFN\u03BB4 production improves HCV clearance. To further understand how genetic variation between and within species affects IFN\u03BB4 function, we screened a panel of all known extant coding variants of human IFN\u03BB4 for their antiviral potential and identify three that substantially affect activity: P70S, L79F and K154E. The most notable variant was K154E, which was found in African Congo rainforest \u2018Pygmy\u2019 hunter-gatherers. K154E greatly enhanced in vitro activity in a range of antiviral (HCV, Zika virus, influenza virus and encephalomyocarditis virus) and gene expression assays. Remarkably, E154 is the ancestral residue in mammalian IFN\u03BB4s and is extremely well conserved, yet K154 has been fixed throughout evolution of the hominid genus Homo, including Neanderthals. Compared to chimpanzee IFN\u03BB4, the human orthologue had reduced activity due to amino acid K154. Comparison of published gene expression data from humans and chimpanzees showed that this difference in activity between K154 and E154 in IFN\u03BB4 correlates with differences in antiviral gene expression in vivo during HCV infection. Mechanistically, our data show that the human-specific K154 negatively affects IFN\u03BB4 activity through a novel means by reducing its secretion and potency. We thus demonstrate that attenuated activity of IFN\u03BB4 is conserved among humans and postulate that differences in IFN\u03BB4 activity between species contribute to distinct host-specific responses to\u2014and outcomes of\u2014infection, such as HCV infection. The driver of reduced IFN\u03BB4 antiviral activity in humans remains unknown but likely arose between 6 million and 360,000 years ago in Africa.","publish_time":"2018-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bamford, Connor G.

In the United States, more than 3,00,000 patients are admitted and about 20,000 die from acute pancreatitis per year. In Taiwan, the incidence rate of acute pancreatitis is 0.03% and the mortality rate among severe acute pancreatitis is 16.3%. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the global budgeting system on health service utilization, health care expenditures, and quality of care among patients with acute pancreatitis in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) was used for analysis. Data on patients with acute pancreatitis diagnosed during the period 2000 and 2001 were used as baseline data, and data from 2004 and 2005 were used as post-intervention data. The length of stay (LOS), diagnostic costs, drug cost, therapy costs, total costs, risk of readmission within 14 days, and risk of revisiting the emergency department (ED) within 3 days of discharge before and after implementation of the global budgeting system were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Data on 2810 patients with acute pancreatitis were analyzed in this study. There was a significant difference in mean LOS before and after introduction of the global budget system (7.34 \u00B1 0.22 days and 7.82 \u00B1 0.22 days, respectively; P \u003C .001)). The mean total costs before and after implementation of the global budget system were Taiwan dollars (NT$) 28,290.66 \u00B1 1576.32 and NT$ 42,341.83 \u00B1 2285.23, respectively. The mean rate of revisiting the ED within 3 days decreased from 9.9 \u00B1 0.9% before adoption of global budgeting to 7.2 \u00B1 0.6% after implementation of the system. The mean 14-day re-admission rates before and after introduction of global budgeting were 11.6 \u00B1 1.0% and 7.9 \u00B1 0.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The global budget system was associated with significantly longer length of stay, higher health care expenditures, and better quality of care in patients treated for acute pancreatitis.","publish_time":"2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ko, Ya-Lin; Wang, Jyun-Wei; Hsu, Hui-Mei; Kao, Chia-Hung; Lin, Chun-Yi","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9ac0a1d2dd861bfa590dc654ddadb324a993fa0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6203586.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6203586/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["National Health Insurance Research Database"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["severe acute pancreatitis","global budgeting system","global budget system","patients","incidence rate of acute pancreatitis","introduction of global budgeting","adoption of global budgeting","mean rate","mean total costs","implementation","mean LOS","days of discharge","baseline data","higher health care expenditures","therapy costs","diagnostic costs","mortality rate","better quality of care","post-intervention data","health service utilization","Taiwan dollars","study","AIM","longer length of stay","National Health Insurance Research Database","risk of readmission","significant morbidity","significant difference","drug cost","NHIRD","METHODS","day re-admission rates","die","impact","emergency department","MATERIALS","year","CONCLUSION","United States","RESULTS","period","analysis"],"language":"en"},

In this study, by means of cellular depletion, the cluster of differentiation (CD) tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD151 were found to reduce HPV16 infection in HeLa cells by 50 to 80%. Moreover, we tested recombinant proteins or peptides of specific tetraspanin domains on their effect on the most oncogenic HPV type, HPV16, and HCMV. We found that the C-terminal tails of CD63 and CD151 significantly inhibited infections of both HPV16 and HCMV. Although CD9 was newly identified as a key cellular factor for HPV16 infection, the recombinant CD9 C-terminal peptide had no effect on infection. Based on the determined half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)), we classified CD63 and CD151 C-terminal peptides as moderate to potent inhibitors of HPV16 infection in HeLa and HaCaT cells, and in EA.hy926, HFF (human foreskin fibroblast) cells, and HEC-LTT (human endothelial cell-large T antigen and telomerase) cells for HCMV, respectively. These results indicate that HPV16 and HCMV share similar cellular requirements for their entry into host cells and reveal the necessity of the cytoplasmic CD151 and CD63 C-termini in virus infections. Furthermore, this highlights the suitability of these peptides for functional investigation of tetraspanin domains and as inhibitors of pathogen infections.","publish_time":"2018-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fast, Laura A.; Mikuli\u010Di\u0107, Snje\u017Eana; Fritzen, Anna; Schwickert, Jonas; Boukhallouk, Fatima; Hochdorfer, Daniel; Sinzger, Christian; Suarez, Henar; Monk, Peter N.; Y\u00E1\u00F1ez-M\u00F3, Mar\u00EDa; Lieber, Diana; Florin, Luise","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a43db4dbbe6272ff71bcd5dc9cbf29bad9cd958e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6212908.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212908/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tetraspanins"],"organizations":["HCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCMV","CD151 C-terminal peptides","potent inhibitors of HPV16 infection","host cells","HeLa cells","CD63 C-termini","C-terminal tails of CD63","HaCaT cells","subsequent infection","recombinant CD9 C-terminal peptide","cytoplasmic CD151","tetraspanins CD9","host cell entry","human papillomaviruses","peptides of specific tetraspanin domains","effect","inhibitors of pathogen infections","cellular depletion","inhibited infections","virus infections","human endothelial cell-large T antigen","human foreskin fibroblast","similar cellular requirements","key cellular factor","composition of cell membrane components","functional investigation of tetraspanin domains","recombinant proteins","oncogenic HPV type","HEC-LTT","control intracellular transport","hy926","HFF","telomerase","cluster of differentiation","determined half-maximal inhibitory concentration","pathogens","EA","cytomegaloviruses","necessity","utilization","suitability","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Over the last decade, the use of Web-based data in public health issues, that is, infodemiology, has been proven useful in assessing various aspects of human behavior. Google Trends is the most popular tool to gather such information, and it has been used in several topics up to this point, with health and medicine being the most focused subject. Web-based behavior is monitored and analyzed in order to examine actual human behavior so as to predict, better assess, and even prevent health-related issues that constantly arise in everyday life. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed at reporting and further presenting and analyzing the methods, tools, and statistical approaches for Google Trends (infodemiology) studies in health-related topics from 2006 to 2016 to provide an overview of the usefulness of said tool and be a point of reference for future research on the subject. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for selecting studies, we searched for the term \u201CGoogle Trends\u201D in the Scopus and PubMed databases from 2006 to 2016, applying specific criteria for types of publications and topics. A total of 109 published papers were extracted, excluding duplicates and those that did not fall inside the topics of health and medicine or the selected article types. We then further categorized the published papers according to their methodological approach, namely, visualization, seasonality, correlations, forecasting, and modeling. RESULTS: All the examined papers comprised, by definition, time series analysis, and all but two included data visualization. A total of 23.1% (24/104) studies used Google Trends data for examining seasonality, while 39.4% (41/104) and 32.7% (34/104) of the studies used correlations and modeling, respectively.

Here, using an IL-10(GFP)/Foxp3(RFP) dual reporter transgenic murine model, we demonstrate that co-expression of CD49b and LAG3 is not restricted to the Foxp3(\u2212) Tr1 cells, but is also observed in Foxp3(\u002B) T regulatory (Treg) cells and CD8(\u002B) T cells that produce IL-10.

IL-35 plays a pivotal role in the development and the function of both regulatory B (Bregs) and T cells (Tregs). In order to further its therapeutic potential, a dairy Lactococcus lactis strain was engineered to express murine IL-35 (LL-IL35), and this recombinant strain was applied to suppress collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Oral administration of LL-IL35 effectively reduced the incidence and disease severity of CIA. When administered therapeutically, LL-IL35 abruptly halted CIA progression with no increase in disease severity by reducing neutrophil influx into the joints. LL-IL35 treatment reduced IFN-\u03B3 and IL-17 3.7- and 8.5-fold, respectively, and increased IL-10 production compared to diseased mice. Foxp3(\u002B) and Foxp3(\u2212) CD39(\u002B) CD4(\u002B) T cells were previously shown to be the Tregs responsible for conferring protection against CIA.

The development of a vaccine against this virus could be a strategy for YPDS control. Since laboratory culture of PiCV is impossible, its recombinant capsid protein (rCP) can be considered as a potential antigen candidate in sub-unit vaccines. The aim of this basic research was to evaluate the immune response of pigeons to PiCV rCP. Sixty six-week-old carrier pigeons were divided into two groups (experimental immunized with PiCV rCP mixed with an adjuvant, and control immunized with an adjuvant only), and immunized twice in a 21-day interval. On the day of immunization and on two, 23, 39, and 46 days post first immunization (dpv), samples of blood, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius were collected from six birds from each group to examine anti-PiCV rCP IgY, anti-PiCV rCP IgY-secreting B cells (SBC), IFN-\u03B3 gene expression, and percentage of T CD3(\u002B), CD4(\u002B), CD8(\u002B), and B IgM(\u002B) lymphocytes. The results indicated a correct immune response to PiCV rCP both in humoral and cell-mediated immunity, which was manifested by seroconversion since 23 dpv, by a significantly higher anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC number on two and 23 dpv, and significantly higher IFN-\u03B3 gene expression since two dpv. There were no significant differences or trends noted between particular T and B lymphocyte subpopulations. To conclude, PiCV rCP may be deemed immunogenic and could be considered as an antigen candidate in sub-unit vaccines against PiCV infections in pigeons.","publish_time":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stenzel, Tomasz; Dziewulska, Daria; Tyka\u0142owski, Bart\u0142omiej; \u015Amia\u0142ek, Marcin; Kowalczyk, Joanna; Koncicki, Andrzej","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a3e6aaf35057f4222ef436b616e9d05106e076e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6265742.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6265742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YPDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["higher anti-PiCV rCP","PiCV infections","laboratory culture of PiCV","dpv","immune response of pigeons","sub-unit vaccines","higher IFN-\u03B3 gene expression","B IgM","YPDS control","adjuvant","day of immunization","week-old carrier pigeons","secreting B cells","correct immune response","potential antigen candidate","B lymphocyte subpopulations","complex disease","particular T","SBC number","young pigeon disease syndrome","Pigeon circovirus","diagnosed virus","day interval","percentage of T CD3","groups","trends","recombinant capsid protein","spleen","cell-mediated immunity","samples of blood","significant differences","basic research","bursa of Fabricius","CD4","causative factors","birds","results","days post","strategy","aim","development","lymphocytes","CD8","seroconversion"],"language":"en"},

In the ER they are restricted to a quality control system that ensures correct folding or eventual degradation of improperly folded polypeptides. Mannose trimming of N-glycans on newly synthesized proteins plays an important role in the recognition and sorting of terminally misfolded glycoproteins for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). In this process misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated into the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and eventually degraded by the proteasome. The mechanism by which misfolded glycoproteins are recognized and recruited to the degradation machinery has been extensively studied during last decade. In this review, we focus on ER degradation-enhancing \u03B1-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) family proteins that seem to play a key role in the discrimination between proteins undergoing a folding process and terminally misfolded proteins directed for degradation. We describe interactions of EDEM proteins with other components of the ERAD machinery, as well as with various protein substrates.

Published studies (between 01/01/2009 and 05/07/2012) describing cases of fatal or hospitalised A(H1N1)pdm09 and including data on bacterial testing or co-infection. RESULTS: Seventy five studies met the inclusion criteria. Fatal cases with autopsy specimen testing were reported in 11 studies, in which any co-infection was identified in 23% of cases (Streptococcus pneumoniae 29%). Eleven studies reported bacterial co-infection among hospitalised cases of A(H1N1)2009pdm with confirmed pneumonia, with a mean of 19% positive for bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae 54%). Of 16 studies of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, bacterial co-infection identified in a mean of 19% of cases (Streptococcus pneumoniae 26%).

CONCLUSION: We found that few studies of the 2009 influenza pandemic reported on bacterial complications and testing. Of studies which did report on this, secondary bacterial infection was identified in almost one in four patients, with Streptococcus pneumoniae the most common bacteria identified. Bacterial complications were associated with serious outcomes such as death and admission to intensive care.

Therefore, we studied the effects of CMV reactivation on the temporal course of host response biomarkers in patients with sepsis. METHODS: In this matched cohort study, each sepsis patient developing CMV reactivation between day 3 and 17 (CMV\u002B) was compared with one CMV seropositive patient without reactivation (CMVs\u002B) and one CMV seronegative patient (CMVs\u2212). CMV serostatus and plasma loads were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassays and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Systemic interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-18, interferon-gamma\u2013induced protein-10 (IP-10), neutrophilic elastase, IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), and IL-10 were measured at five time points by multiplex immunoassay. The effects of CMV reactivation on sequential concentrations of these biomarkers were assessed in multivariable mixed models. RESULTS: Among 64 CMV\u002B patients, 45 could be matched to CMVs\u002B or CMVs\u2212 controls or both. The two baseline characteristics and host response biomarker levels at viremia onset were similar between groups. CMV\u002B patients had increased IP-10 on day 7 after viremia onset (symmetric percentage difference \u002B44% versus \u221215% when compared with CMVs\u002B and \u002B37% versus \u002B4% when compared with CMVs\u2212) and decreased IL-1RA (\u221241% versus 0% and \u221249% versus \u002B10%, respectively). However, multivariable analyses did not show an independent association between CMV reactivation and time trends of IL-6, IP-10, IL-10, or IL-1RA. CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation was not independently associated with changes in the temporal trends of host response biomarkers in comparison with non-reactivating patients. Therefore, these markers should not be used as surrogate clinical endpoints for interventional studies evaluating anti-CMV therapy.

Macrophages are one of the initial targets for rickettsiae after inoculation by ticks. However, it remains poorly understood how rickettsiae remain free in macrophages prior to establishing their infection in microvascular endothelial cells. Here, we demonstrated that the concentration of Rickettsia australis was significantly greater in infected tissues of Atg5(flox/flox) mice than in the counterparts of Atg5(flox/flox) Lyz-Cre mice, in association with a reduced level of interleukin-1\u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2) in serum. The greater concentration of R. australis in Atg5(flox/flox) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) than in Atg5(flox/flox) Lyz-Cre BMMs in vitro was abolished by exogenous treatment with recombinant IL-1\u03B2. Rickettsia australis induced significantly increased levels of light chain 3 (LC3) form II (LC3-II) and LC3 puncta in Atg5-competent BMMs but not in Atg5-deficient BMMs, while no p62 turnover was observed. Further analysis found the colocalization of LC3 with a small portion of R. australis and Rickettsia-containing double-membrane-bound vacuoles in the BMMs of B6 mice. Moreover, treatment with rapamycin significantly increased the concentrations of R. australis in B6 BMMs compared to those in the untreated B6 BMM controls. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Atg5 favors R. australis infection in mouse macrophages in association with a suppressed level of IL-1\u03B2 production but not active autophagy flux. These data highlight the contribution of Atg5 in macrophages to the pathogenesis of rickettsial diseases.","publish_time":"2018-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bechelli, Jeremy; Vergara, Leoncio; Smalley, Claire; Buzhdygan, Tetyana P.; Bender, Sean; Zhang, William; Liu, Yan; Popov, Vsevolod L.; Wang, Jin; Garg, Nisha; Hwang, Seungmin; Walker, David H.; Fang, Rong","journal":"Infect Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9c34b0ef9eacdf1bce00a71e1ff612479c3f004.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6300621.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6300621/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["flox","Atg5-deficient BMMs","Atg5-competent BMMs","counterparts of Atg5","contribution of Atg5","B6 BMMs","australis infection","BMMs of B6 mice","concentration of Rickettsia australis","Lyz-Cre BMMs","infected tissues of Atg5","mouse macrophages","Rickettsiae","\u03B2 production","LC3 puncta","colocalization of LC3","Lyz-Cre mice","association","bone marrow-derived macrophages","suppressed level of IL","recombinant IL","greater concentration of","exogenous treatment","untreated B6 BMM controls","reduced level of interleukin","increased levels of light chain","bound vacuoles","double-membrane","small portion of","concentrations of","initial targets","inoculation","active autophagy flux","form","microvascular endothelial cells","pathogenesis of rickettsial diseases","life-threatening infections","humans","ticks","p62 turnover","rapamycin","analysis","data","serum","results"],"language":"en"},

Despite the country\u2019s improved dengue surveillance, it still suffers from various setbacks and needs to be complemented with alternative approaches. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of Internet-based surveillance such as Google Dengue Trends (GDT) in supplementing current epidemiological methods for predicting future dengue outbreaks and patterns. With this, our study has two objectives: (1) assess the temporal relationship of weekly GDT and dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila from 2009\u20132014; and (2) examine the health-seeking behavior based on dengue-related search queries of the population. The study collated the population statistics and reported dengue cases in Metropolitan Manila from respective government agencies to calculate the dengue incidence (DI) on a weekly basis for the entire region and annually per city. Data processing of GDT and dengue incidence was performed by conducting an \u2018adjustment\u2019 and scaling procedures, respectively, and further analyzed for correlation and cross-correlation analyses using Pearson\u2019s correlation. The relative search volume of the term \u2018dengue\u2019 and top dengue-related search queries in Metropolitan Manila were obtained and organized from the Google Trends platform. Afterwards, a thematic analysis was employed, and word clouds were generated to examine the health behavior of the population. Results showed that weekly temporal GDT pattern are closely similar to the weekly DI pattern in Metropolitan Manila. Further analysis showed that GDT has a moderate and positive association with DI when adjusted or scaled, respectively. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a delayed effect where GDT leads DI by 1\u20132 weeks. Thematic analysis of dengue-related search queries indicated 5 categories namely; (a) dengue, (b) sign and symptoms of dengue, (c) treatment and prevention, (d) mosquito, and (e) other diseases. The majority of the search queries were classified in \u2018signs and symptoms\u2019 which indicate the health-seeking behavior of the population towards the disease. Therefore, GDT can be utilized to complement traditional disease surveillance methods combined with other factors that could potentially identify dengue hotspots and help in public health decisions.","publish_time":"2018-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Howell T.; Carvajal, Thaddeus M.; Bautista, John Robert; Capistrano, Jayson Dale R.; Viacrusis, Katherine M.; Hernandez, Lara Fides T.; Watanabe, Kozo","journal":"Trop Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/407207cc711d3067f35c04426fa4055ccb37ccfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6306840.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6306840/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Dengue Trends","GDT","DI"],"locations":["Philippines","Metropolitan Manila"],"keyphrases":["dengue incidence","dengue hotspots","symptoms of dengue","Thematic analysis of dengue","dengue-related search queries","Google Dengue Trends","reported dengue cases","future dengue outbreaks","country\u2019s improved dengue surveillance","Metropolitan Manila","health behavior","weekly temporal GDT pattern","temporal relationship of weekly GDT","weekly DI pattern","Cross-correlation analysis","Data processing of GDT","public health decisions","weekly basis","Pearson\u2019s correlation","based surveillance","population statistics","relative search volume","cross-correlation analyses","major public health concern","traditional disease surveillance methods","study","Google Trends platform","supplementing current epidemiological methods","respective government agencies","economic burden","delayed effect","potential of Internet","factors","term","prevention","entire region","treatment","positive association","signs","Results","categories","mosquito","patterns","word clouds","Previous studies","adjustment","scaling procedures","city","Philippines","symptoms\u2019","majority","various setbacks","alternative approaches","diseases","objectives","weeks"],"language":"en"},

However adaptive pressure eventually leads to changes in phenotype that involve non-neutral mutations. The relation between neutrality and adaptation has been studied in the context of RNA before and here we further study transitional mutations in the context of degenerate (plastic) RNA sequences and genetic assimilation. We propose quasineutral mutations, i.e. mutations which preserve an element of the phenotype set, as minimal mutations and study their properties. We also propose a general probabilistic interpretation of genetic assimilation and specialize it to the Boltzmann ensemble of RNA sequences. RESULTS: We show that degenerate sequences i.e. sequences with more than one structure at the MFE level have the highest evolvability among all sequences and are central to evolutionary innovation. Degenerate sequences also tend to cluster together in the sequence space. The selective pressure in an evolutionary simulation causes the population to move towards regions with more degenerate sequences, i.e. regions at the intersection of different neutral networks, and this causes the number of such sequences to increase well beyond the average percentage of degenerate sequences in the sequence space. We also observe that evolution by quasineutral mutations tends to conserve the number of base pairs in structures and thereby maintains structural integrity even in the presence of pressure to the contrary. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that degenerate RNA sequences play a major role in evolutionary adaptation.","publish_time":"2018-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rezazadegan, Reza; Reidys, Christian","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/444cc65fbe22dd6583120260c488dd621ebadab4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6307299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6307299/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Motoo Kimura"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["degenerate RNA sequences","average percentage of degenerate sequences","quasineutral mutations","context of degenerate","Boltzmann ensemble of RNA sequences","non-neutral mutations","minimal mutations","study transitional mutations","context of RNA","evolutionary adaptation","regions","evolutionary simulation","evolutionary innovation","presence of pressure","selective pressure","adaptive pressure","sequence space","neutral theory of Motoo Kimura","intersection of different neutral networks","phenotype set","general probabilistic interpretation of genetic assimilation","number of base pairs","major role","plastic","structures","changes","highest evolvability","MFE level","structural integrity","BACKGROUND","population","element","relation","neutrality","properties","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The number of claims was relatively stable over time. However, the rate per 100,000 full-time workers decreased from 25.2 to 15.4. The decrease was most pronounced for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, which were the most frequent infections for which claims were made at the start of the period.

However, the growing number of TB claims does not reflect an increased infection risk, but rather improved methods for the diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI).

Identifying novel antivirals such as those that target viral entry could help broaden the therapeutic arsenal against HCV. Herein, we investigated the anti-HCV activity of the methanolic extract from Rhizoma coptidis (RC), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine documented by the WHO and experimentally reported to possess several pharmacological functions including antiviral effects. Using the cell culture-derived HCV system, we demonstrated that RC dose-dependently inhibited HCV infection of Huh-7.5 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations. In particular, RC blocked HCV attachment and entry/fusion into the host cells without exerting any significant effect on the cell-free viral particles or modulating key host cell entry factors to HCV. Moreover, RC robustly suppressed HCV pseudoparticles infection of Huh-7.5 cells and impeded infection by several HCV genotypes. Collectively, our results identified RC as a potent antagonist to HCV entry with potential pan-genotypic properties, which deserves further evaluation for use as an anti-HCV agent.","publish_time":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hung, Ting-Chun; Jassey, Alagie; Lin, Chien-Ju; Liu, Ching-Hsuan; Lin, Chun-Ching; Yen, Ming-Hong; Lin, Liang-Tzung","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cd645b337ac36abbd467302eb73b4ae086e60ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6315547.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315547/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","RC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV entry","HCV genotypes","inhibited HCV infection","anti-HCV activity","anti-HCV agent","RC blocked HCV attachment","improvement of HCV treatment","suppressed HCV pseudoparticles infection","cell culture-derived HCV system","viral entry","RC dose","host cells","impeded infection","key host cell entry factors","cell-free viral particles","viral replication","novel antivirals","Hepatitis C Virus","novel direct-acting antivirals","risk of developing hepatitis C-associated end-stage liver diseases","methanolic extract","potent antagonist","DAAs","potential pan-genotypic properties","fusion","significant effect","lack of prophylactic measures","evaluation","protection","important public health threat","Rhizoma coptidis","use","therapeutic arsenal","pharmacological functions","antiviral effects","carriers","non-cytotoxic concentrations","results","traditional Chinese medicine"],"language":"en"},
